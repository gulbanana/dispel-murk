<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> -------------------------------------------<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a beautiful spring Sunday in Florida. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> March 9th, 1969. The Tet Offensive is in its second phase and the Suez Canal has been stormed. There's not going to be another Summer of Love ever again. All is right with the world.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The waters of the Indian River are muddy but the Atlantic is clear as far as the eye can see. On Cape Canaveral there's a hive of activity as the day begins; airbases and ports and civvie facilities all operating in unison, trucks and personnel pouring into KSC where the great gantries stand empty beside a steaming launchpad.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's the one thing that ruins it, really.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Far above the Earth, David Scott is walking in space. The Apollo 9 Lunar Module is orbiting the earth, a staggering triumph of engineering, bearing three Americans on their ride around the globe in a prototype spacecraft.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The mission isn't over, but there's already a celebratory air at the NASA complex. It's easy to navigate the crush of people and cars around the great white cube that is the Vehicle Assembly Building; the four strangers making their way through the crowd are in jovial company, nobody bothering to check badges or take names.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sloppy.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Good cheer is infectious. Henrik assumes it would put a smile on his face.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Installation security's not his job, though. Not yet, at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Out from Orlando and a temporary accomodation at Cape Kennedy AFS, Cleaner and the Russian Henrik David just have to cross a carpark. The general shape of the assembly building and its nearby facilities are familiar to Henrik, but it also strikes him how different everything is, how much further apart, how they've built their facility on a 'Space Coast' full of life instead of hidden away in the desert.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's in his deputy getup. He figures that's the right play for the moment.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's always hated these damn hats.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik's heard the stories about what the Americans use their deserts to hide. It's hard to put much stock in them, but he's heard them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient has been driven up from Port Canaveral by a man named 'Caddy', some sleepwalker who turned up at his hotel door three hours early. If this is his first time in America, he might have expected more dense urban infrastructure or less varied accents - but the G.I.s everywhere are right out of the news at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia takes a different route to work, this morning. She used to work here, of course, but has been relegated to Operations and Checkout until recently. Very recently. She doesn't know precisely what to expect, since Lewis had someone call last night to say the meeting's been moved up to 9 AM.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Airmen in khaki and scientists in white and civilian contractors in denim mix under the sunlight and salt air. A big blocky entrance looms as four Seers of the Throne arrive, separately, together, to meet the man they're replacing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He’s left Isaias with Uffa. For this, the first meeting, he’s dressed well. Caddy doesn’t have much to say, so he smokes and looks at the green world passing by. What a green. Much darker, hotter, wetter, than either the Po Valley or the coast plains of the Horn. He traveled to Burundi for a few weeks, and saw the same shades there. Caddy handed him a newspaper from a local outfit. The launch is today. Claudio hopes everything <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> went well and that the mission succeeded. When they pull up and it’s obvious that it has, he smiles. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia's car ride to work is a breeze, as usual. There's a small tin of cookies in the passenger seat, for all her old Sleeper colleagues. It'll be nice to see them again.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't like how little they know about this mission. And he especially doesn't like how well things seem to be going on the surface. Complications.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik is wearing a plain gray suit, checked tie with a clip. He's got a simple briefcase containing nothing but pens, pencils, legal pads, and a slide rule. He's really curious how this went so wrong.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Your host's standing just inside a big square lobby, well away from the main security scanners by a little unmarked door. He shades his eyes against the sunlight leaking in off the coast and waves - this is Lewis, a black man in a pilot's uniform who looks younger than he really must be. There's another soldier with him and a little cart for bags - did anybody bring luggage?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's bags are all in his car.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient sees: a decorated pilot strides forward to greet him, limned with song. Loud and bassy music kicks in the instant you see the man, his nimbus flaring to create what is in effect a theme song. It's no piece you recognise, though it sounds modern.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient left most of it at the hotel. He has a small rolling suitcase containing a few presents for his presumed associates, and a briefcase with notepads and pens. He rolls forward toward the pilot. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis has a little fat moustache which works surprisingly well with his cropped hair. He glances at you searchingly then smiles and says his name. "You must be the first specialist. Damn good to meet you and a damn good day."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia's not far behind, but Lewis hasn't greeted her yet. Not really a surprise. She doesn't know how much he knows, but- the project leader is a Master of Forces. Better not upset him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's to Henrik David, Cleaner presumes. He's never met Lewis but it'd be pretty difficult to confuse him with the science team.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's to Orient, actually - Henrik and Cleaner have arrived a little later, where they saw a group converging from across the carpark. No recognition here, but they're the only people with Supernal magic hanging off them like a birthright and an affront.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio sets the suitcase upright and holds his hand out. “I must be. Good morning. My name is Claudio Kapic. Are we waiting for others, or proceeding inside for a briefing?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis: "Just a couple more. Here, Cynthia.. and those guys must be two of the others." To the uniformed aide: "Jack?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jack: "Captain." He's going to load up Orient's baggage.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient thanks Jack as he takes the suitcase. “Just mind how roughly you set it down; there’s glass inside.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Over in the main hall, you can see a whole delegation of reporters with flashing cameras following some VIP into the visitors' centre. The great E X P L O R E sign which hangs over the hall is getting a workout from the streams of visitors and NASA workers today.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia walks in with a smile. "Lewis, so good to see you again," she says brightly, and might even mean it. She extends her hand to shake his.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis calls over to Cleaner and Henrik: "Hey, welcome! Let's talk inside, through here!" He shakes Cynthia's hand, putting on a pretty good act if it's an act. "And welcome back to the family. Laborer will be delighted."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jack, the private, is wheeling suitcases - carefully - through the little door already. Nobody's questioning your right to bypass security - not with the uniforms and the air of authority and the the constellation of access-affording magic that hangs about five mages of the Iron Pyramid.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik goes where he's told.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner moseys after him, checking out the security checkpoints -- or lack thereof -- out of habit.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia: "Likewise!" She follows, making small talk with Jack about the weather.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You're ushered quickly through unpainted concrete corridors, with just enough time to pass names around and check out each others' fashion sense. Somewhere in another part of the building, a P.A. system is going on about ship movements and splashdown planning.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Seeing Orient makes Henrik wonder if he should get new suits while he's here.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> "Henrik David," says Henrik David to the others, offering handshakes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A Russian and an Italian coming in to help showrun a Panopticon op in Florida. National borders don't mean what they did before he Awakened, but that's still mighty uncommon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia greets the newcomers with the same smile she gave to Lewis. "Cynthia. Cynthia Munroe. I'm local." Handshakes all around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jack is augmented by another aide who calls Lewis 'Major', and then they both vanish as you pass through a pasteboard door into a little anteroom. There's another door, metal; Lewis puts one hand on the handle and turns back to you. "Ready to meet the dream team?" There's no edge to his voice. From the other side of the door you hear laughter and the clink of cutlery.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't nod, smile, or take off his sunglasses, but he does shake hands. "Deputy Wayne Barrett. Cleaner."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The call moving up their meeting didn't faze Cleaner much -- he's up an hour before dawn on workdays -- but all in all, none of this rushing is putting him at ease.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But then, if things were good here, he'd still be hunting vampires.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient shakes hands, and remains quiet. He notices the accents, and wonders why they’ve called foreigners in to deal with what he assumes is Atlanteans planning to disrupt the Cape’s operations here. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With no objections, the Obrimos pilot flings open the door to reveal a combination breakroom/laboratory. "Reinforcements are here at last!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A cheer goes up from benches around the room. There are half a dozen people inside, curious faces calling out names, a little kitchen where a guy in a vest is making coffee. Several people are finishing up breakfast or brunch. All but one of them are visibly magical, and they're all wearing two little patches in different places on their clothing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One is the NASA logo, an view of the stars with a ringed word and a red chevron. The other you don't recognise, but it incorporates occult symbology and the fasces of the US government.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does Cynthia recognize any of them?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The people, that is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She does! Cynthia knows two of the mages from her work on the early days of Project Aningan; Laborer, the director, and the liason Dirt Cool. They're greeting her, and everyone is calling out their names at once - as well as those two, you all hear "Trajan", "Manhunter", "Fieldmouse", "Caddy". It's not yet obvious which ones go with which faces.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis: "We have specialists from Italy and Moscow, the best man the war could spare and our own Cynthia. Might be another guy later- things are going to get easier around here." He waves everybody in, newcomers clearly expected to introduce themselves.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia gives a small smile and a wave, like she's just shown up at an office party. "I'm Cynthia, nice to meet you all! I'm sure Laborer and Dirt Cool have told you stories about me already, ha ha!" She laughs pleasantly. "I'm sure we'll all get along just fine." Especially if you remember the stories about me.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner can't say as he's heard those.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Laborer is a dark skinned woman who Cynthia vaguely recalls as more interested in technology than magic. She was hunched over a long table which is shrouded in utter blackness, but smiles slightly as she withdraws her arms from the void- one of them offers a half-full box of donuts. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik David: "Good morning. I am Henrik David. I am dispatched from my position as Project Sub-Director for the State Commission on Piloted Flights. Also I am Primate of the Eclipse. So that is who I am. I look forward to working with you."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dirt Cool, an older white guy in a suit with an incongruously healthy goatee, gives a thumbs up. "Kyle, for the new guys. MKWOMBAT liason - that's the U.S. equivalent of our project - good times."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient can recognise that Dirt- that Kyle has pretty competent mindshielding spells up. So does Cleaner, incidentally.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How competent, exactly? Is the the only Mind Adept here? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cynthia looks at the box of donuts from Laborer, "Oh, I shouldn't..." she says, in the tone of someone who immediately does.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Actually, judging by sympathetic resonance, several of the Project Aningan team could be Mastigos. Kyle, certainly, but Orient thinks also the two men who haven't spoken.. not too surprising, in the Ministry of Panopticon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's not compelled to give a longer introduction than the one he just did, but he's listening very attentively. Like as not this'll all be on the test later.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Trajan speaks up from where she's perched on a lab stool. "Trajan, Praetorian Ministry, Vanguard/Interdict LV. 03." She's a woman of around thirty in running clothes, and when she looks at the newcomers they- there's something wrong with her eyes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Glass?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The lower part of Trajan's face is ordinary, thin lips in a happy smile above a rounded chin, but from her nose on upward there's a bruise- in the air, not on her flesh. It looks like Paradox, a smudge filled with pain. Or, to Cleaner, with Death.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I do project security. You need anything murdered, let me know! Seriously, I love that stuff. I will also talk your ear off about the local hops - there's a brewery down at the port doing some great stuff."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Fieldmouse speaks up in a generically Euro accent. He's got brown hair and smoked glasses, seems a little jittery, though there's no coffee in front of him. "Seriously, do not get Trajan started if you haven't booked a couple of hours for gossip."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once the looks get a bit too expectant: "I'm Cleaner. Know some Matter magic. Probably why I'm here. Spent most of the last month and change down Orlando way. Stay clear of Orlando for now if you can."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient realizes that of all the people assembled who have little idea what’s going on, he probably has the littlest. Oh well. “Hello. My name is Claudio Kapic, or Orient. I live in Italy, yes. I don’t think that my background is quite so technical as all of yours. I must confess that I came here on rather vague instructions…I brought presents, though. Should I…” He holds up the rolling suitcase, curious if this is a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> good time. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis: "Holy shit, really?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Laborer: "We've got to get back to work soon.."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dirt Cool: "Presents!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everyone looks pleasantly surprised except the remaining seer, Manhunter; he's over in one corner fiddling with a disassembled tripod and some sort of electrical setup. He's watching you quite closely, but with a kind of scornful look.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Fieldmouse: "Oh yeah, and I do manip - moving us around the schedule and keeping NASA off our backs. Probably be working with you guys. But what's this about presents?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis, to Laborer: "Sure, but we've got a few minutes. Caddy, go get the studio set up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lewis is in charge, yes? Orient will direct his attention to him. “Just a small gesture of goodwill.
