[09:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12
[09:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12You might be at the turning point. The dark solars are at best stalemated with you and at worst on the back foot - Reckoning's retreating under Ir's escalating assault, Coils is lurching frustratedly like a half-dead bull, and Bells is barely composed, cycling from target to target. Behind you, Octavian's destroyed something like half the buildings ringing what was once a market 
[09:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12square.
[09:44] <03Crion> 4Stalemate?
[09:45] <03Crion> 4Let's do something about that.
[10:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12In a last-ditch effort, Dragon's Coils whirls and punches through the magic taking form between Eikichi's hands - more and more, you get the idea this guy is specialized in part in taking down sorcerers - and then tries to keep going and get his hands around the little shit's throat. No good, though - he's held back by his own injuries.
[11:08] <03Crion> 4She comes so close to getting her revenge.
[11:08] <03Crion> 4But he's too fast -- he dodges around the first attack and dissipates, appearing back across that barrier of pain.
[11:09] <03Crion> 4She was waiting for that.
[11:09] <03Crion> 4Ir launches herself off the roof, driving down at the man who has beguiled, humiliated, insulted and hurt her and her friends --
[11:09] <03Crion> 4And he slips aside again at the last second.
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12So was he, of course. Fortunately, Ir's steeled her heart against the abyssal menace, and feels not a shred for sympathy for the simply itinerant preacher as he tries to dodge her deadly blows.
[11:10] <03Crion> 4Don't tell me what I feel, asshole. I'm on to your tricks.
[11:14] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya is about to try and use the environment to his advantage when Wicked Triumph's Reckoning appears right in front of him. It's a practically unconscious reaction as he brings his weapon to bear wherever he can find weakness!
[11:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12The biggest and best-armored of the abyssals is still leaving craters around Eikichi's feet and sending violent vibrations up and down the linchpin, but starts and turns as he realizes how beleagured the necromancer is. Whirlling, Dragon's Coils attempts to beat back the two solars closing in on Triumph's Reckoning.
[11:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doesn't work, though - Tatsuya's got this guy's measure, now.
[11:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12He'd better, anyway, because a little girl with fangs and claws has just leapt onto Ir's back and started thrashing and scratching as fiercely as she can. The spearwoman's armor is holding for now, but holy shit is it annoying-
[11:29] <03Crion> 4You have no idea.
[11:30] <03Crion> 4Ir tries to slam the undead little idiot to the ground, but instead ends up losing her own footing -- and any chance she'd have had to affect the outcome of this fight, let alone effect the outcome of this fight.
[11:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning's running out of avenues. He sashays as best he can through the fight, dodging around and behind Dragon's Coils, placing a steadying hand on the shoulder of the embattled Ir that seem sto be more for his sake than for the spearwoman's, but ultimately finds himself surrounded by all sides and short on breath.
[11:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We've actually just been standing in this one courtyard the entire time. There's an entire city of avenues out there.
[11:42] <03Crion> 4Ir tries to elbow him in the face. Doesn't work.
[11:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12He reaches out a hand towards Eikchi, who's in the process of fending off razor-sharp, green-stained blood chains that just will not stop flailing at him with increasing futility. "Sho...! Was this your idea?"
[11:43] <03@Ferrinus> "I thought - you'd come to talk-"
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi seems to have dropped into a nearly mechanical fighting stance, parrying attacks with effortless reflex. It's clear his mind is elsewhere and has been for some time. "I did. Of the seven of us, I was the only one who didn't want to kill anybody/
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "
[11:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning: "Then stop this! You can't have come here merely for this!"
[11:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "WAS THIS THE BEST YOU COULD DO?!"
[11:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12The necromancer's eyes widen. "Th-"
[11:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi snaps, rounding on the man he's convinced is his friend with tears and fire in his eyes. "There are bodies in the streets. These are YOUR people. This was YOUR plan. That's his daughter. You don't- you didn't mean ANY of it! It was just an excuse, you just wanted vengeance, you forgot how to DO anything but kill!"
[11:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You betrayed me. You betrayed yourself. What do you have to show for it?"
[11:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12His face twitches. "Vengeance is the least of - ...bodies are merely- ...the people kill-..." 12Wicked Triumph's Reckoning bites down on his own words, turning away (yes, in the midst of combat) and pressing a hand to his forehead before running it back through his silky hair.
[11:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12He turns back, points. "You don't go far enough, Eikichi Sho! If you think I'm betraying the creed, it's because you haven't understood it!"
[11:56] <03@Ferrinus> "I'll SHOW you the best I can do!"
[11:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Put up or shut up."
[11:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning: "Rouse it!"
[11:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells, struggling with Ir: "Mrrf- rrgh- it's not readyyyy."
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I KNEW it! This is just a project for you. The necromancy beneath the city."
[11:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning: "We're improvising!"
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "None of this means anything. You didn't mean any of this."
[11:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells: "It's not even midniiiiight-"
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're dead, and death means nothing."
[11:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "One of two ways this ends--"
[11:58] <03Crion> "--maybe only one--"
[11:58] <03Crion> 4Whatever else she was going to say gets lost in her scuffle with this demon child.
[11:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning: "Do it! You swore!" 12Coils: "Sweetie-" 12Bells: "Fiiine."
[12:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Only Eikichi notices it - when Reckoning growled 'you swore', he shot a glance at Coils in specific.
[12:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi leans down and looks at Bells. "Hey. Have you ever been to Thorns?"
[12:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells is currently upside down, trying to chew off the hand Ir's using to hang on to Iscariot, but her eyes flash. "What- what do you know about Thorns!"
[12:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I was there too. I saw the cattle in the streets, fly-blown and hateful. What was left of the people starved into eating them. What was being done to the people who survived. I saw the graves, the new ones and the old ones, all of them disturbed. Everyone lost a friend or a brother or a mother to the stink of that mountain-thing sleeping at its gates."
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's what Crystal is going to be if you go through with this. You've been through that. You're still going through it. Tell me - can you really wish that pain on anyone else?"
[12:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi walks around Reckoning to stand behind him. "We could fight, sure. You might even win. But it's not the only way to settle this. And my idea's more fun."
[12:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tears well up in in the corners of the little girl's eyes, and as she's upside down it causes her eyeshadow to run up around her brow and past her temples.
[12:24] <03Crion> 4Oh god there's a crying dead child on top of me.
[12:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10If Ir had a dinar for every time-
[12:25] <03Crion> 4AND HER DAD'S REALLY HOT
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emily continues holding onto Ir with inhuman, perhaps even monstrous strength. Funny thing is, Ir is stronger still, but unfortunately she has no real idea of how best to grapple with what's basically an angry, armored cat.
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wait-
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells continues to you get it.
[12:26] <03Crion> 4Augh
[12:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Fortunately, that's all she's doing - the monster-kid isn't producing and crushing a jade slip or whispering some kind of occult command phrase or something.
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wicked Triumph's Reckoning, on the other hand, has got sweat beading on his brow. He's on so many back feet he might as well be a centaur and Eikichi's breath is in his ear and, ironically enough, his charismatic enemy has convinced his younger, weaker servant to betray him for the sake of her people.
[12:28] <03Crion> 4Ir keeps stumbling around -- this time towards the single dad, and away from the hideous puppetmaster pretty boy. She's trying to keep her body between the crying heap of annoyance latched to her chest and the guy currently begging Eikichi for his life, because, well, she's got a pretty good idea what's coming.
[12:28] <03Crion> 4Eikichi's the carrot...
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning, to Eikichi, under his breath: "You can't - you can't just want to save this city, to bring it back to normal-"
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm not the one who failed to live up to the ideals you espouse. I didn't turn those mobs against you. I inspired them in the name of what you preach! There is no place from the stars to the void that will remain unchanged for our passing through it. There is no more normal."
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We can do better. We can do better together."
[12:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12...
[12:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wicked Triumph's Reckoning: "...yield! We yield."
[12:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Reckoning's already holding some sort of glass-and-iron contraption, an ampule of glass roiling with silver and black light in the middle. "We can talk. Just don't come any-"
[12:47] <03trenchfoot> 6A tendril of pure darkness peels itself up from behind Wicked Triumph's Reckoning and slowly creeps up his back as he surrenders. Suddenly, Tatsuya is behind him, wrapping the shadow roughly around his neck and yanking tight -- though he lets off at the last second.
[12:47] <03trenchfoot> 6Wicked Triumph's Reckoning slumps to the ground, unconscious. His shadow bubbles around him, lapping up over his body before reverting back to normal.
[12:47] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I thought that would never end."
[12:47] <03Crion> 4...and Tatsuya's the stick.
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You see this?"
[12:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Dissolving Dragon's Coils slowly rises out of a crouching combat posture. He cricks his neck to the side a bit, causing the high black collar jutting up from around his armor to retract and allow him to wipe at his bloodied mouth with the back of a gauntlet.
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Death's champions can't even do darkness as well as we can."
[12:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "Sheesh."
[12:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "...honey, let go of 'er."
[12:49] <03Crion> 4Ir marches right over to the big guy.
[12:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells drops off Ir's back. "Sorry."
[12:49] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Not a big deal, kid."
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well!"
[12:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So."
[12:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils licks his lips. "You know, we're supposed to, uh. Help him overthrow the city. Bring low the high, sorta thing."
[12:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm Eikichi Sho."
[12:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What are your names?"
[12:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils. "Ah, yeah. I'm..." 12He takes a breath. "Dissolving Dragon's Coils. This is Black Bells Chiming. Say hi, sweetie." Bells: "Hi."
[12:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh my gods."
[12:50] <03Crion> 4To Coils: "Well. Good news about what we're already doing. Without people dying."
[12:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Are all your names like that?"
[12:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "Uhh... far as I've seen, yeah. Some kinda thing."
[12:52] <03Crion> 4Ir reaches down and absently tousles Bells's hair before moving over to Tatsuya and the unconscious body of Reckoning.
[12:52] <03Crion> 4To Tatsuya: "He's alive, right?"
[12:52] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I hope you know what you're doing, Eikichi. I really, really want to kill him."
[12:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bells rolls her eyes: "It's 'cause our very names have been consigned to oblivion, dad." 12Coils rumples her hair. "Putcher claws back, sweetie."
[12:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "If he was dead, there wouldn't be a body. So yes. Regrettably."
[12:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi, to Blossom: "He was one of us once. That could've been you or me."
[12:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We owe him the same second chance I'd like to think we'd deserve."
[12:54] <03Crion> 4Ir sighs. "So do we have any way to actually chain this dude up, or are we putting him up in the Heavensward?"
[12:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's an unpleasant squelching/rumbling sound, and Black Bells Chiming's armor is revealed to feature fingerless gauntlets currently occupied by completely normal hands, if you ignore the fact that the girl's skin has got a desaturated yellowish-brown cast you'd normally associate with masonry of some kind.
[12:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's got shackles. Soulsteel. Halts respiration."
[12:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We can chain him up and then take him to the Heavensward."
[12:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Bells and Coils: "Do you have them? Can you go get them?"
[12:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "Ut-ut-ut. Not so simple. Like I said, we're  supposed to help him topple the city. Put it in the peoples' hands."
[12:55] <03Crion> 4Ir considers asking Eikichi a rude question, but holds her tongue and starts looking for the shackles.
[12:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "We're sworn. Now, he surrendered, kinda..."
[12:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom cracks her knuckles and says "Lethe's a second chance," 7but she doesn't move to actually harm Reckoning.
[12:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You're sworn to help him, yeah?"
[12:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How much help are you if you make a move now and we have to kill him?"
[12:56] <03Crion> 4How's Octavian doing against, you know. Everyone else.
[12:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "Thaaat's right, and all the powers of the opposite of heaven are behind it. Ain't goin' back on that contract."
[12:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12He nods to Eikichi. "See, that's what I'm thinkin', at the moment."
[12:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Coils: "But it still pays to be careful. See?"
[12:57] <03Crion> 4Ir, over your shoulder: "You're sworn to help him achieve a goal, yeah? Think of this as helping him in spite of himself."
[12:57] <03Crion> *4her
[13:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Carefulness is a fine quality in a mercenary. It- wait.
[13:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wait."
[13:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Breaker?"
[13:25] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmmm. You have to put the city in the hands of its people. We have to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, so that the strong should not harm the weak. There may not be a conflict here."
[13:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Of course there isn't."
[13:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Yara sends a messenger back. Hers reads: "No Chosen threat against the governor, then? I'll come find you as soon as I can if so. Just tell the cherub." 12Sure enough, a the six-winged, blue-chrome baby that arrived to whisper into Eikichi's ear hangs there for a few minutes more, attentively listening and looking around.
[13:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Not as long as she negotiates."
[13:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's not clear whether a response like that is to Yara's liking, but there's no further messengers.
[13:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's quick and fairly easy to deal with the last few things demanding immediate attention - Bells scurries off to fetch some soulsteel restraints that she and Eikichi can assure the circl will arrest the respiration of essence, Coils is polite enough to help kick away any mindless undead that come pawing at you, and Bells assures you that the Niobraran gestalt construct gestating 
[13:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12beneath the Guild administrative building won't be waking for another three days at the least. Plenty of time to deal with it, surely!
[13:31] <03Crion> 4Ir makes sure Wrecked is secured, then says to Tatsuya: "I'll be right back. Gonna try something."
[13:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12A great deal's set before you to deal with in the coming days and weeks, though. You'll have to defuse and dispel the monster the dark chosen have built (or, at least, extend its slumber indefinitely), you'll have to destroy or disperse or coopt what remains of the Wyld Hunt, and you'll have to square the circle of Reckoning's revolution, Grey Nara and the Haslanti League's grip on 
[13:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12power, and Wicked Triumph's Reckoning himself.
[13:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Whatever.
[13:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10I'm tired.
[13:31] <03Crion> 4The place she left Errant isn't too far away. Ir leaps up onto a rooftop, then across to another, and another, and...
[13:31] <03Crion> 4She's gone for half an hour.
[13:31] <03Crion> 4Then...she's back.
[13:32] <03Crion> 4Riding a horse no one's seen in awhile.
[13:32] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Fucker was grazing outside the gates."
[13:32] <03Crion> "Weren't you, boy?"
[13:32] <03Crion> "Yeah, fuck you too."
[13:32] <03Crion> "I'm gonna ride out. I'll be back with the Heavensward."
[13:32] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Smart horse." 7Then: "I should see to Ami."
[13:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, there might be time for a nap or something, at the least. Coils and Bells aren't going anywhere - they can't - but they're hovering near the bound Reckoning, as per Coils's oath. Yara arrives shortly - she'll want the support of Eikichi and Blossom to investigate the necromantic working, and will probably have some very pointed questions about the dark chosen.
[13:33] <03Crion> 4She squints down the road. "You want to head out too, just take this promenade. I'll fly down it once I've got the ship. I'll know you when I see you."
[13:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I should see to-" 10To Octavian: "Go back to Yara. Bleed on the nice rugs for me."
[13:34] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Noted. I'm going to stick around here for a while, keep an eye on Reckoning, I think."
[13:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12Octavian: "That will be the last order you give me. Watch your back, sorcerer."
[13:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Eat shit."
[13:34] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "See you around, Octavian."
[13:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12He snarls, but he's already started to collapse into dust and doesn't offer a rejoinder.
[13:35] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "What an unpleasant creature."
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion>  
[14:08] <03Crion> "Well that fucking sucked."
[14:09] <03Crion> 4Hours later, the Heavensward lays inside low-hanging cloud cover above the city, as the sun rises on a new day.
[14:09] <03Crion> 4Objectively speaking, last night was extremely successful. As was the day before that. And the day before that. Maybe not the day before that. But definitely the day before that.
[14:09] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "At least there's still a city for us to save."
[14:10] <03Crion> 4Subjectively, fighting, killing, losing, and winning is all just fucking exhausting.
[14:11] <03Crion> 4They stand on the bridge of the great golden ship, their new..."friends"...either sleeping in a family suite on the crew deck, or sleeping off a more hardened accomodation down in the far aft.
[14:12] <03Crion> "Yeah," 4Ir says, then steps away from the main console. Then steps back, makes sure she's still got control of the ship--
[14:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's leaning on the railing, looking down at the clouds. He's been quiet since the battle ended.
[14:12] <03Crion> 4Then steps away again.
[14:12] <03Crion> "Okay. Okay."
[14:13] <03Crion> "This is very strange, to helm a ship not from the wheel."
[14:15] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom huffs as she finds a spot to sit down. "Keep your hands on the wheel if it bothers you. The ship won't mind."
[14:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's miraculous."
[14:17] <03Crion> "It's fine." 4She frowns. Ir has almost total recall and control over the entirety of the project, which is frankly...kind of a lot. Full situational awareness of a roughly 120 foot ship. She's driven something this big before -- it hasn't been that long since the Chambermouse -- but it's still worrisome. But's almost like she can feel someone else's hand on the wheel with her.
[14:17] <03Crion> "I've got it."
[14:19] <03Crion> "We can walk, if you want. We don't have to stay in here."
[14:19] <03Crion> 4The bridge is a quiet place. Unfurnished. Kind of creepy in low light.
[14:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I still feel like a stowaway."
[14:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We need more stuff."
[14:20] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "It'll look better once we get some furniture."
[14:20] <03Crion> "And I feel like a first mate. Responsible if we fuck up, but not really the captain yet."
[14:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We've got cabins picked out. Have we- what are we doing with the rest of the space?"
[14:21] <03Crion> 4Ir grimaces. "I'm putting my horse somewhere."
[14:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll need stabling, certainly. The cargo hold?"
[14:22] <03Crion> "My main concern if we have a way to like: directly drop shit into a forest or body of water below us."
[14:22] <03Crion> *is if
[14:29] <03Crion> "But yeah, I got him some hay and he's running around down in the cargo hold right now."
[14:29] <03Crion> 4She'll probably have a mess to clean up later, but they should eventually get some stabling in.
[14:30] <03Crion> 4Not like they're going to be making actual freight runs in this ship.\
[14:34] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "If you mean actual shit, the heads will do. As for the animals... there should be room for stabling on the lower decks. That's where pigs and goats and things are usually kept."
[14:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Draw up inventories. Things we need. We'll put lists together and figure out what we can get here and what it'll be smarter or easier to get as we go South."
[14:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Blossom mentioned something about beds from the East."
[14:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, closing her eyes and smiling: "Fungal mattresses."
[14:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Excuse me. I don't think I have time to sleep but I really need to clean up."
[14:37] <03Crion> 4Ir nods. "We've got three belowdecks, yeah? I'm thinking we reserve this deck for officer's and public space, the deck below for our brig and other workspace, and the lowest deck for cargo and stabling." 4She's walking towards the rear of the room. "Fungal mattresses sound good. I've still got the helm, so we can get out of here."
[14:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom will follow the other two. "We can reclaim some of the hold as needed by putting in flooring and simple walls."
[14:41] <03dammitwho> 7She adds, "Even with half of the hold repurposed, we have enough space for supplies to keep us all for months if not years."
[14:41] <03Crion> 4Ir grimaces again. "Again, we're keeping a horse there. He's a good boy. But he's still a horse."
[14:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "You'd be surprised how much you can pack into a small space. Most ships keep animals aboard."
[14:43] <03dammitwho> "A ship this size would have to support some hundred-fifty men on the waves."
[14:43] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Well, we'll try to direct Errant's contributions down rather than up."
[14:46] <03Crion> "Anyway!" 4She shuts the door to the bridge behind the three of them. The main hall of the Heavensward's first deck is eerily silent -- everyone else aboard is still asleep, presumably, but sound usually doesn't die this much in an empty metal space. "I was thinking of turning the aft space into a lounge and meeting hall.
[14:46] <03Crion> "
[14:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's already got stuff set up in a cabin, which right now is just the bed Blossom built with Eikichi's bedroll stretched over it and the vanity he had Usagi build for him. "Sounds good."
[14:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'll catch up with you two in a little bit."
[14:49] <03Crion> "Okay."
[14:51] <03Crion> 4Ir leads Blossom to the aft space in question. It's mostly unfurnished, but most importantly, instead of merely having slightly port windows cut into the golden hull, the entire rear of the room is open to the air, with a grand balcony.
[14:51] <03Crion> 4It's easily the most sociable room on the ship.
[14:51] <03Crion> 4Hard to defend, maybe, but leave that to Ir.
[14:51] <03dammitwho> "I hope he's alright..."
[14:52] <03Crion> 4Ir snorts.
[14:52] <03Crion> 4Then she sighs.
[14:52] <03Crion> "He'll be fine."
[14:53] <03Crion> "...We probably should have killed that man."
[14:54] <03Crion> 4Ir wanders over to the grand balcony and sits up on the golden ledge. She frowns, and the ship very slightly adjusts its orientation to make her less likely to fall off.
[14:59] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Cheer up! I probably will anyway."
[15:01] <03Crion> "Oh, I'm cheerful enough about it."
[15:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok's still minding the necromancers. Usagi's doing some maintenance. The other demons are dead. So Eikichi's cabin is empty when he sits at the big silver mirror and looks into his own eyes. His face is pale and washed-out, his hair is greasy and flat. He looks like a wreck. "I'd pass for one of them already," 10he confides in his reflection. The caged thing under the cloth 
[15:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10stirs and groans at his voice. 
[15:01] <03Crion> 4Iscariot idly slips from her back into her hands, resolving as a six-string instead of a spear.
[15:01] <03Crion> "He lost his most important battle, after all. His second most important battle, too."
[15:02] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't play anything, though.
[15:03] <03Crion> "Wrecked, not Eikichi. Though maybe he lost something, too."
[15:03] <03Crion> "Some vaguer kinda innocence."
[15:04] <03dammitwho> 7She nods. "I wish we'd found him faster."
[15:04] <03Crion> 4Ir almost bites her lip. "Yes and no, for me."
[15:05] <03Crion> "I wasn't at my best for that dust up. I should have insisted we wait longer. But that itself might have been a mistake."
[15:05] <03Crion> "And that calls into question the display I put on earlier. In front of the mob."
[15:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Without breaking eye contact with himself Eikichi reaches up and pulls the cloth down. The demon stirs, red eye wild until it focuses on its master. It lets out a hiss of contentment and begins to whisper. "you are weak." 10Eikichi sets out his bottles and jars. "you failed them."
[15:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "If it means I cant be there to protect the people I care about when they need me to protect them, I shouldn't be playing shows."
[15:06] <03Crion> "That makes this--" 4She strums Iscariot. "--a weakness. But only because of me. Not because of it."
[15:06] <03Crion> "So that makes me a weakness."
[15:07] <03Crion> "Which leaves us with a problem."
[15:07] <03Crion> "You expect strength from me, and I've rarely delivered that."
[15:09] <03dammitwho> "It doesn't seem like that to me," 7Blossom says frankly.
[15:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There are ten steps on the Sapphire Road. First, you must purify the ground. Something oil-based is best, to clean the skin without draining any moisture. Get a thin layer over the skin, use a little warm water to emulsify, and repeat. Everything falls away. "you won't understand."
[15:11] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "Well. Next time I get the shit kicked out of me by monks, or fail to kill an assassin, or get stymied by a little girl, I'll remember those words fondly."
[15:12] <03dammitwho> 7She shrugs. "Pain is weakness leaving the body."
[15:12] <03Crion> "I agree. But I still got a whole lot of pain."
[15:13] <03Crion> 4There is, in fact, still a red wet patch on the side of her blouse, barely visible now that her buff jacket is hanging open.
[15:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Second you must strip away purity. Water here, to clear the residue of the oil. Desire, then, for the thing itself. This and no more. "you can't understand."
[15:16] <03dammitwho> "You should bandage that."
[15:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Third is to strip away memory. Something abrasive, applied gently. Scour the skin, slough off the dead. Open it all up. Desire for the thing as it is, with no regard for what it was. "you can't see them."
[15:17] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I should do a lot of things."
[15:17] <03Crion> "This'll keep."
[15:24] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Where do you want to go?"
[15:25] <03Crion> 4Ir closes her eyes. "Somewhere other than here."
[15:25] <03Crion> 4Then she opens them. "But not anywhere we can fly to."
[15:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He keeps going. The fourth step is to relax. Something to soften and prepare the skin for the flow of essence. Release from desire, for to crave something pushes it away. "you can only see yourself."
[15:27] <03Crion> 4Ir hups down off the bannister and just leans against it, now. Then she guides the Heavensward up, slightly, to keep with a cloud bank--
[15:28] <03Crion> 4Then she pulls back, back, back -- stop.
[15:28] <03Crion> 4The rear balcony juts out of the cloud bank, and Blossom and Ir look out over the city of Crystal as the sun rises.
[15:28] <03Crion> "I feel good about what we've done here."
[15:28] <03Crion> "Do you?"
[15:29] <03dammitwho> "I'd like to stop at the Scavenger Lands. Someplace a little more civilized, and not full of ice and necromancy. Make a little money, buy a few comforts, then... East? South? I've heard there are hidden caches of ancient lore in the far Directions. If the corrupt bureaucracy of Heaven is against us, we need to know more."
[15:29] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "I'd love to travel. I've never been out of the North."
[15:29] <03Crion> "Errant might need a shave, but I'm sure he'd like it too."
[15:30] <03dammitwho> 7She looks surprised. "Feel good? Absolutely. We did what we were Chosen to do. We saved a whole city from being crushed like Thorns, and we reminded the Haslanti to keep the good of the people in mind."
[15:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Only now is the supplicant ready to touch the flow of essence that cuts the heart of the Sapphire road. Wyld-kissed green-gold sparks ignite between Eikichi's face and the mirror, filling the room with fireflies. "Now, it's been a long day, and we've got a long day ahead. But we just need to perk up! We've no excuse not to look our best." 10His eyes are on his eyebrows as he says 
[15:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10this, and they ripple ever so slightly like tall grass smoothed out in the wind. "they only see you when they look at him."
[15:30] <03Crion> 4Ir chuckles. "We also humiliated the Immaculates, which will have repurcussions in my hometown."
[15:31] <03Crion> "I guess I should forget about them."
[15:31] <03dammitwho> 7She snorts. "They should've known better. Immaculate monks are supposed to be heroes."
[15:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Serums and ampoules, tiny crystal lenses - to concentrate the essence, to steady us as the Road itself pulls us forward. Eikichi scoffs at the demon. "Oh, come on. You made that one up."
[15:33] <03Crion> 4Ir's eyes tighten. "Immaculate monks aren't supposed to be a lot of things. Neither are the people who support them."
[15:33] <03Crion> "They're heretics."
[15:33] <03Crion> "But it's hard to blame them."
[15:36] <03dammitwho> "You don't get to be an abbot if you aren't willing to knuckle under when it counts."
[15:36] <03Crion> "You don't get to anything if you aren't willing to knuckle under when it counts."
[15:36] <03Crion> "Not even creatures like you and me."
[15:37] <03dammitwho> "Hrmph!" 7Blossom replies cheerily. "We'll see about that."
[15:38] <03Crion> "We already did, Blossom."
[15:38] <03Crion> "That dipshit in the brig is proof."
[15:39] <03Crion> "And we did it because it would've hurt someone if we did otherwise."
[15:39] <03dammitwho> "I wonder. What is he?"
[15:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "they look at him and they see you. you look at him and you see-" 10THE SEVENTH STEP is the mask. The face-that-isn't, the lie that proves the truth. He looks green and ghostly as it sits on his face, eyes closed. He hadn't thought about it in years. Hadn't spoken to anyone about it. But it's been flitting into his mind like an intruder for weeks now. First down underground, the 
[15:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10first time he heard the voice... that night on the glacier with Ir... "he's dead. he's going to die again. but you're still here."
[15:39] <03Crion> 4Ir hups back up on the railing. "You mean metaphysically, or as a man?"
[15:40] <03dammitwho> "Metaphysically."
[15:40] <03Crion> "Because I'm still trying to puzzle out the first, but I've got definite ideas about the second. None of them favorable to him."
[15:40] <03Crion> "Well."
[15:40] <03Crion> "He's like us, yeah?"
[15:40] <03Crion> "But he's not."
[15:41] <03dammitwho> "Sure, but... inverted. How does that happen? Can it happen both ways?"
[15:41] <03Crion> "Now, when we were kicking his ass -- in those moments when shit was darkest. Did you draw on your faith in the Sun?"
[15:41] <03Crion> "I did."
[15:42] <03dammitwho> "Of course."
[15:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eighth is vision. Far-seeing is far-knowing, and to show the world your face without making it show you its own is worse than blindness. It's spendthrift. Something to even out and give special attention to the skin around the eye sockets, the most delicate skin on the face. "you - are - inadequate."
[15:43] <03Crion> "And that -- that was metaphysical. I'm...I'm a fairly strong believer, in Sol Invictus. For my own reasons. I've prayed to him many times. I received help from those prayers as I was do."
[15:43] <03Crion> *due
[15:43] <03Crion> "But this was different."
[15:44] <03Crion> "So we're looking at, yeah, a total inversion."
[15:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi just puts his face in his arms. His shoulders shake. But he doesn't make a sound. You learn not to make a sound.
[15:44] <03Crion> "Religiously."
[15:44] <03Crion> "But they're like us."
[15:45] <03Crion> "I was converted, once. Maybe they can be too."
[15:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I mean the mercenary and his daughter, obviously."
[15:49] <03dammitwho> "That other one..." 7She waves a hand as though disposing of something repulsive.
[15:49] <03Crion> 4Ir grins. "Yeah. Too bad he has a kid."
[15:50] <03Crion> 4She blinks and frowns. "I mean. I'm sure she's fine. For an undead brat."
[15:51] <03dammitwho> "They still have some kind of moral sense, as much as any human mercenary."
[15:52] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Human mercenaries have more moral sense than you give them credit for. But less moral courage."
[15:53] <03dammitwho> "If you say so."
[15:53] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I do say so. I've met them."
[15:53] <03Crion> "The Grinning Regiment went to their deaths bad men. And they knew they should have been good."
[15:53] <03Crion> 4She shakes her head. "Doesn't matter."
[15:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anyway. This isn't actually an adequate replacement for the ninth step, to protect. All around his reddened eyes, face, neck - a concoction with honey and castor oil. It keeps the skin from drying out or flaking in the wind and the cold. He'll need to make a new preparation when the weather changes. The cover's back on the cage now.
[15:54] <03Crion> "Our real problem remains Reckoning."
[15:54] <03Crion> 4Ir glances over at Blossom. "How bad does he have his hooks in Eikichi?"
[15:56] <03dammitwho> "Less now. He bit off more than he could chew."
[15:56] <03Crion> 4Iscariot shudders in her hand. "Yeah."
[15:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The final step is obvious. The greatest ally of the truth-seeker, and the greatest enemy of good skin. With one final mineral preparation and a mantra of focus, Eikichi is ready to face the sun.
[15:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Truth is beauty," 10says the sorcerer. "And beauty, truth."
[15:57] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Are you committed to him?"
[15:57] <03Crion> "Eikichi Sho."
[15:57] <03Crion> "I don't mean as a man."
[15:57] <03dammitwho> "Am I- wh--"
[15:57] <03Crion> "As an idea."
[15:58] <03Crion> "Do you think he represents an ideal worth fighting for."
[15:59] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "He who stands with me shall be my brother."
[15:59] <03Crion> 4Ir smiles. "They say that in the Heavenwatch, too."
[15:59] <03Crion> "It's a good maxim."
[15:59] <03Crion> "It's hard to practice."
[15:59] <03dammitwho> "One of the best."
[16:01] <03Crion> 4She leans back a bit over the edge. The ship shifts ever so slightly to keep her balanced. "But you didn't answer my question. I'm a true believer, Blossom. And when I die, I expect no forgiveness for my sins, because I don't deserve it and that's not the currency our Lord trades in."
[16:01] <03Crion> "I want to know that what I'm doing right now is worth it."
[16:02] <03Crion> 4Blossom might notice, for the first time, that Ir is wearing an old weathered wooden medallion around her neck, peeking out from the blouse under her jacket. It's a rough-hewn wooden Sun.
[16:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ugh. Eikichi needs more clothes.
[16:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This is too warm, this is too cold. He wore this three days ago-
[16:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom looks away from Ir, out over the passing landscape: "I think, like all of us, he has the capacity to be the best. I think, like all of us, he's lonelier than he usually lets on."
[16:06] <03dammitwho> "We're not that different from him."
[16:06] <03Crion> "I'm very different from Him."
[16:06] <03Crion> "I'm here as punishment."
[16:09] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom can hear the capital-H. "I meant Eikichi."
[16:09] <03dammitwho> "Though maybe that's true for Sol Invictus too."
[16:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Talking about me while I'm not around?"
[16:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi rejoins the others now, all of the night's doubt and strain washed from his face. He's flawless again. "I never took you for a gossip."
[16:11] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Please. Your anima is a sign that reads 'the only thing worse than being talked about is NOT being talked about' five hundred feet tall."
[16:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yes but I didn't think you'd noticed."
[16:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This is a nice space. Open, airy - maybe hard to defend?"
[16:15] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Not so hard."
[16:15] <03Crion> 4She hops down off the railing again. "Not with, like. Total operation control."
[16:15] <03Crion> "...I could move the ship side to side here with my mind, but I won't."
[16:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Can you sense the entire ship?"
[16:16] <03Crion> "The ship, and some small gap beyond it. Just to make sure I don't hit anything."
[16:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How finely?"
[16:16] <03Crion> "Envision a bubble."
[16:16] <03Crion> "Around all of this. Maybe fifteen feet at length out to each side."
[16:17] <03Crion> "I can feel all of that."
[16:17] <03Crion> "Can move within it, too."
[16:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods: "What I mean is, can you perceive what's going on in the ship? Can you feel what they're doing in the brig, for instance? Can you tell if Tatsuya's asleep or awake?"
[16:17] <03Crion> "Haha. No."
[16:18] <03Crion> "But one day, maybe one day soon, the answer to that's yes."
[16:18] <03Crion> "Depends on His blessings."
[16:18] <03Crion> 4Ir looks around and grins. "Sure as shit think He likes it."
[16:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "He better. It's just the beginning of what we'll do."
[16:19] <03Crion> 4Ir walks out into the empty space. "So you're the other person on this ship that goes to bars. What do you think of this as a public area?"
[16:19] <03Crion> "Where should we put the bar? The stage? I've got opinions."
[16:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's big enough. The balcony worries me. It's one thing to get thrown out into a snowbank. Question is, I guess, do you want to be backed by the view or by the murals I'm going to put up?"
[16:22] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "Oh, we're sure as shit putting up some netting. But no, I'm not putting my back to the railing. That's fine for me, but if I bring Samer up here and we get attacked, I can't be worrying about throwing him off the damn ship. I'm thinking bar on one wall, stage opposing it. Means patrons have to shuttle back across the room for a drink, but we're only really gonna be putting 
[16:22] <03Crion> on private shows."
[16:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If we needed to entertain we could have a wait staff. Elementals or something."
[16:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How are the acoustics?"
[16:24] <03Crion> 4Ir scoffs. "Just put those undead to work. Big daddy's the bartender, little kid's running drinks out."
[16:25] <03Crion> "Acoustics are what they are. The walls will need some massaging -- gold's not the best receiver."
[16:25] <03Crion> "Much better to have a wall behind us than the open air, though."
[16:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We can work with that. There are materials we can use - very light woods down in the East - that won't add appreciably to the weight of the ship but will help sculpt the sound."
[16:26] <03Crion> "Having a giant open hole to the left of any performance is an issue, but we can fuck with it. Especially if we've got the performances planned."
[16:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Blossom: "Will you be preaching from the balcony?"
[16:27] <03Crion> 4The Heavensward will give a whole new meaning to 'back that ass up,' Ir doesn't say out loud.
[16:30] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Might be."
[16:30] <03dammitwho> "Preaching... I'll have to think about it."
[16:30] <03Crion> "Not the worst use of your time."
[16:31] <03Crion> "You've seen what I've done with singing. Imagine what you could do with something people actually can believe in."
[16:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Somebody's got to preach, and who is it if not you?"
[16:32] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Could be you."
[16:32] <03Crion> "But only if you believe."
[16:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It couldn't be me."
[16:33] <03Crion> 4Ir shuts her eyes and leans back into the breeze. "I disagree."
[16:33] <03Crion> "It wouldn't be you."
[16:33] <03Crion> "But it could be."
[16:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's got to be Blossom."
[16:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And it's got to happen. The Immaculate Faith is corrupt, and if it's corrupt then it's corruptive. We can't fight the Wyld Hunt and concede the religious argument."
[16:37] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You're not telling me anything I don't already know."
[16:37] <03Crion> 4Ir: "But you need to have skin in the game, too."
[16:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't need to convince you."
[16:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I just put this shirt on."
[16:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Bitch, please."
[16:38] <03Crion> "I know where we stand."
[16:38] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom snorts with laughter.
[16:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi rolls his eyes. "My point is, if Blossom's on the fence, she shouldn't be. It's just obviously right."
[16:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "And my point is, I know where Blossom stands. I need to know about you."
[16:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Excuse me?"
[16:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No thrones, yeah?"
[16:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah."
[16:40] <03dammitwho> "Oh, I mean, clearly I've got to say something to remind people of the truth. I've just never done it before."
[16:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "What about when you have to sit on one?"
[16:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't."
[16:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You mean, what about when you have to sit on one."
[16:41] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Oh yes you you do. You demand worship. You cultivate it. The Lord Himself won't let you deny it."
[16:42] <03Crion> "When I have to sit on one, I will do the best I can to die properly."
[16:43] <03Crion> "The Sun doesn't love me. He doesn't even like me. He just needs me to do what's right."
[16:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, gods, Ir, I can only hope that when the time comes to martyr myself I made sure to keep talking about it for months and months first."
[16:47] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No you don't."
[16:47] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You could hope."
[16:47] <03Crion> "But you don't."
[16:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Of course the Sun loves you. It's just not worth that much that he does."
[16:49] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom looks nonplussed. What's Ir getting at?
[16:52] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "Have you even talked to Him? Do you even know what it feels like, to have his light on your skin? You got a trolley pass on your past life. You got ideology, not deep wounds. You got remove. You--"
[16:52] <03Crion> "You're right."
[16:52] <03Crion> "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up." 4Her smile's gone.
03[16:52] * tom2 is now known as tom
[16:52] <03Crion> "When you know, if you know."
[16:52] <03Crion> "You'll know."
[16:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "What's a trolley pass?"
[16:53] <03Crion> 4Ir looks over at Blossom incredulously.
[16:55] <03dammitwho> "What?"
[16:55] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You can go anywhere, anytime."
[16:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "This conversation is surreal."
[16:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "That doesn't excuse you from it, pretty boy."
[16:59] <03Crion> 4This is the second time this has been deployed as a term of endearment, rather than an insult.
[16:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How am I supposed to prove to you that I'm on your side?"
[16:59] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "You don't have to."

[17:00] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Honey, I'll explain it to you later."
[17:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So does he."
[17:04] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yes He does. And the thing about you and me is that if we want to fight Him we know precisely where He is."
[17:04] <03Crion> 4Ir leans out over the balcony backwards and points up at the Sun. "He's right fucking there."
[17:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's got some nerve."
[17:05] <03Crion> "This world needs nerve, Eikichi Sho."
[17:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The people who need it don't have it. The people who have it don't need it. Here, in Heaven, where the dead walk."
[17:08] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We're not in Heaven yet. Heaven's full up. With people like Yara, right?"
[17:08] <03Crion> "I'm dumb as shit. I'll cop to that. But that's what she said."
[17:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If Heaven were full of people like Yara, Creation wouldn't be like this."
[17:08] <03Crion> "We can't speak to how Creation is."
[17:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Of course we can."
[17:09] <03Crion> "Nah. All we can do is talk about what we've seen. And we've seen some shit."
[17:09] <03Crion> "But there's three other poles, right?"
[17:09] <03Crion> "And then there's the Realm."
[17:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There are five poles."
[17:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "One of which is in the Realm."
[17:10] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "Like I said. Dumb as shit. I have this spear because I'm a traitor, and I wield it as an idiot."
[17:11] <03Crion> 4Ir: "But I'm not wrong on the principles."
[17:11] <03Crion> 4Ir: "And if an idiot can be right, none of us can afford to be wrong."
[17:12] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Ir has a point. I wonder how close to Heaven the Heavensward can get us?"
[17:12] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...We can find out."
[17:13] <03Crion> 
[17:13] <03Crion> 4The Heavensward begins to rise.
[17:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Please don't fly into the sun."
[17:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "What you need to learn, Eikichi Sho, is that God is not the same as Heaven."
[17:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So no."
[17:14] <03Crion> "I'm not trying to fly into the fucking Sun."
[17:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Aiming for Heaven and landing in the Sun sounds like something you'd do."
[17:15] <03Crion> 4Ir frowns. "No it doesn't."
[17:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Prove it."
[17:17] <03Crion> "I'll fuck up in front of monks, get humiliated by abbots, lose all my pride to shitheads who can't even bother to spell my name. But I know how where I'm going and I've got a plan to die."
[17:17] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So grab onto a railing, dumbass."
[17:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We could fly a bit higher though. It's supposed to be hotter the higher you go, and I've got this meditation technique I want t--whoooooaaaahhh"
[17:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi grabs the railing and leans back against it.
[17:19] <03Crion> 4She says in his ear: "Here's the thing, young man."
[17:19] <03Crion> "Heaven's not a place on earth."
[17:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I heard different."
[17:20] <03Crion> "In this world, love doesn't come first."
[17:20] <03Crion> 4She gently shunts him over to Blossom.
[17:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It will if I say it does.
[17:21] <03Crion> 4Good luck.
[17:21] <03Crion> 4This far up, they can see almost everything.
[17:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Blossom...!"
[17:21] <03Crion> 4The entirety of the world laid out before them.
[17:21] <03Crion> 4A vast nothingness in three directions, and then below...
[17:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How high up can the Heavensward stand to go?"
[17:21] <03dammitwho> "H-hey! Wow!"
[17:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "A bit higher."
[17:23] <03dammitwho> "During the day it can go until the wood starts to burn! At night, who knows! Maybe we could fly to the moon!"
[17:25] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm not sure she would like that."
[17:25] <03Crion> "Look down."
[17:25] <03Crion> 4The world spreads out below them.
[17:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They're going to think we abandoned them."
[17:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "They're going to be fine."
[17:26] <03Crion> "Because people can live on their own."
[17:26] <03Crion> "And they'll have to."
[17:29] <03Crion> 4An entire world is laid out below them -- snow, tundra, cities and plains, mountains and valleys, and a tall tower to the south, and a great, high mountain even further south..
[17:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi gets a little woozy looking down at it all. "Huh. Look at that. You can almost draw a straight line from Meru to here through the Nail."
[17:30] <03Crion> "You can."
[17:31] <03Crion> 4Ir: "This is only a sliver of what the world looks like, to Him. And we can only stay up here a minute."
[17:31] <03Crion> "But enjoy it."
[17:31] <03Crion> "This is the place closest to God."
[17:32] <03Crion> "This is the place closest to Heaven."
[17:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How's Blossom doing?
[17:32] <03dammitwho> 7She's delighted. She's taken her coat off and is smiling, eyes closed, as the sun beats down on her bare shoulders.
[17:33] <03Crion> 4There is absolutely nothing between us and the Sun. No roofs, no clouds, no guilt. Ir has bowed her head, though. She is not exulting.
[17:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Seeing Blossom happy relaxes him. But something about this still doesn't sit right.
[17:36] <03Crion> "They say in Heaven, love comes first."
[17:36] <03Crion> "But it's not true."
[17:36] <03Crion> "That's just a song."
[17:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's hand on the railing creeps over Blossom's. At this moment he's the only one looking down at Creation and he doesn't feel himself shaking his head.
[17:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There's nobody up here."
[17:43] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yes there is."
[17:43] <03Crion> "There's us."
[17:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's not enough."
[17:44] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'll bet against you on that, Eikichi Sho."
[17:44] <03Crion> "Everything I've got. Even my life."
[17:44] <03dammitwho> 7It takes a few moments, but Blossom's hand unclenches from the railing and flips to close around Eikichi's. Now they're clinging to each other instead of the ship.
[17:44] <03Crion> "Because I don't even have that anymore."
[17:45] <03Crion> "And you'll never collect, because no matter how much you wish you weren't: you're a better man than that."
[17:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't say anything.
[17:51] <03Crion> 4Ir grins up into the Sun, hanging above them in the emptiness. This is as close as she's worth getting. "In a moment, we're going down."
[17:51] <03Crion> *4Ir grins up into the Sun, hanging them above the emptiness. This is as close as she's worth getting. "In a moment, we're going down."
[18:00] <03Crion> 4She doesn't bother putting an arm out.
[18:00] <03Crion> 4The Heavensward just drops.
[18:00] <03Crion> 4But it corkscrews as it does in a wide arc.
[18:01] <03Crion> 4Wide enough not to induce vomitting, and that makes it scenic, almost.
[18:02] <03Crion> 4Ir puts her hand out to push Eikichi forward, then sees where his hand is, and Blossom's hand is.
[18:02] <03Crion> 4And instead leans back against the rail and inhales the air as it goes by.
[18:03] <03Crion> 4She's past that purity of form, now. She's past love.
[18:03] <03Crion> 4She can only hope to join him. To be permitted to join him. She can only hope for the end of the world, and herself, to recognize that she wasn't entirely monstrous.
[18:04] <03Crion> 4But He doesn't love you, Ir.
[18:04] <03Crion> 4He doesn't even like you.
[18:04] <03Crion> 4The Heavensward drops back through the clouds.
[18:06] <03Crion> "Here we are."
[18:09] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, hair disheveled and grinning broadly: "I still don't know what a trolley pass is."
[18:10] <03Crion> 4Ir: "It means the people who don't matter don't matter."
[18:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Have you ever been to Nexus before, Blossom?"
[18:11] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Be careful, though. That's far fewer people than you might think."
[18:13] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Nope."
[18:14] <03Crion> 4Ir leaves them now that the ship is righted, and wanders over to the doorway.
[18:14] <03Crion> 4There was actually a stool in the room.
[18:14] <03Crion> 4It got stuck in the transition.
[18:15] <03Crion> 4Ir drags it over to where the 'stage' would be.
[18:15] <03Crion> 4She props it up and leans back against the wall, the six-string resting against her chest.
[18:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "There are streetcars there. Big metal boxes on tracks, sort of like giant riding beetles. They're mechanical, people use them for transit. Sometimes they're called trolleys."
[18:16] <03dammitwho> "Ohhhhhhh. Now I get it."
[18:17] <03Crion> 4Ir starts re-tuning her six-string.
[18:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you want to see them?"
[18:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We could go to Nexus. We could probably afford to sleep somewhere that didn't smell like garbage all the time."
[18:19] <03Crion> 4Ir chuckles roughly.
[18:19] <03Crion> 4Six-string sounds about right, now.
[18:21] <03dammitwho> "Nexus sounds like a good a place as any."
[18:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's... well. I guess we'll see for ourselves."
[18:21] <03Crion> "Guess so."
[18:22] <03Crion> "I'm gonna test the acoustics as is, so you might want to go get some sleep."
[18:24] <03Crion> 4Ir pauses. "Actually."
[18:24] <03Crion> "One sec."
[18:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi waits.
[18:24] <03Crion> 4Ir disappears into the ship for a moment, then returns with her beat-up, acoustic six-string.
[18:24] <03Crion> 4To Eikichi: "You know how to do percussion on a string instrument?"
[18:25] <03Crion> "Basically, you hit it."
[18:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That makes sense."
[18:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "It does."
[18:26] <03Crion> 4She pulls Eikichi into the corner and confers with him for a moment.
[18:28] <03Crion> 4When they're done, Ir returns to about where the stage would be, and after checking on Eikichi, says to the audience:
[18:28] <03Crion> "This is about my ex-boyfriend."
[18:28] <03Crion> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuhaOg4xSaA
[18:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "doot-do-do, doot-do-do~"
[18:29] <03Crion> 4Damn, that works well.
[18:29] <03Crion> 4And it sounds nice, too.
[18:29] <03Crion> 4They could use a sound reflector along the back wall, but the bar itself shouldn't be a problem.
[18:30] <03Crion> 4And there's enough surface area that the song doesn't get lost in the open air.
[18:31] <03Crion> 4They might want to extend the back wall a bit further, but that's an entirely aesthetic concession. They don't actually have to do additional construction.
[18:31] <03Crion> 4When the song's done, Ir's grinning.
[18:31] <03Crion> "God, that guy sucked."
[18:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi snorts.
[18:33] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The last two verses were aspirational. If you were wondering."
[18:33] <03Crion> 4She collects her acoustic. "You're getting better at this."
[18:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I've been- thanks."
[18:35] <03Crion> 4She pauses before taking the six-string out of his hands. "You can hang onto this, if you want. If you're headed in a different direction, no worries."
[18:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh, I couldn't- I was just going to go pick up my own. That one's yours."
[18:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Fair enough. But if you break a string, you know where this one is."
[18:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's kind of you. Thank you."
[18:37] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You're welcome." She turns to face both of them, Eikichi and Blossom. "We're back down in the clouds now. We should sleep."
[18:37] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You're welcome." 4She turns to face both of them, Eikichi and Blossom. "We're back down in the clouds now. We should sleep."
[18:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah. There's a lot of work to do."
[18:38] <03Crion> "There's a saying in Pneuma. 'The world won't end overnight.'"
[18:38] <03Crion> "Always knew it was true. Didn't realize until now it was both a blessing and a curse."
[18:40] <03Crion> "Good night, you two." 4Ir pauses. "Or good morning."
[18:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You too."
[18:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't sleep. When he's in his cabin, sitting on his bed, he's got the six-string he already bought and stashed under his bed in his lap. It doesn't sound like Ir's, but it sounds fine enough to learn on. He plays very gently, so as not to rouse his demons.
[18:44] <03Crion> 4Ir moves to the balcony. When they leave, she's practicing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyOSXRCJlIg
[18:44] <03Crion> 4That's obviously a duet. She doesn't have a second part.
[18:44] <03Crion> 4Just saying.

[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 
[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 
[09:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Has Tatsuya seen the big keyharp Ir got for the Heavensward lounge? That's where Eikichi is right now, with stacks of incomprehensible mathematical notes and very simple sheet music balanced on top of it. He's got a glass of wine and he's got that unnervingly still posture Tatsuya recognizes as a sign his mind's wandered off into daydreaming. Probably anyone could sneak up on Eikichi 
[09:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10in this state, nevermind the legendary Golden Hand.
[09:20] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya has been keeping to his room, lately, so his venture around the ship to clear his mind now is the first time he lays eyes upon it. There's a quiet "Hm." 6of surprise that anyone could be forgiven for missing. Upon noticing Eikichi, however, he goes quiet, and begins his work. Soon there's a comfy armchair pulled up alongside Eikichi, conveniently out of his main view, with a lounging Tatsuya resting comfortably astride 
[09:20] <03trenchfoot> it facing him. "Nice piece we've got here."
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Aahh!" 10There's a pair of clunky chords as Eikichi presses the keyboard, startled.
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...how long have you been there?"
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He looks up and sees that it's gotten dark. "How long have I been here?"
[09:22] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Here? Ten seconds, tops. In the room? Five minutes, maybe? No idea how long you've been here, unfortunately. I haven't been out here in a while."
[09:24] <03trenchfoot> "What did I miss?"
[09:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi takes a moment to collect himself. "Ir got a keyharp. She wants to install a still and start brewing. Blossom was talking about heating the seats in the- I guess on a ship they're called heads? Oh! There was something I wanted to run by you."
[09:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're trying to figure out what kind of course to set after we leave Crystal, which I think we're going to do... tomorrow."
[09:30] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What a coincidence. Wait, you can heat a head?"
[09:31] <03trenchfoot> "That's maybe the most luxurious thing I've ever heard of."
[09:32] <03trenchfoot> 6He coughs, mildly. "Sorry. Anyway, I have no real direction beyond where the wind takes us, unless other people feel strongly. There's bound to be something we can do there, and anywhere away from that... you remember, that giant figure off in the distance? Yeah."
[09:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, don't worry. We can top that. I'll think of something. Anyway, Blossom was thinking it'd be nice to spend some time exploring in the Scavenger Lands. Look for more ruins, build connections where there are more people and so forth. But it's still just an idea, and since you're the hometown kid I wanted see sound you out about it."
[09:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He waves a hand. "Forget about the behemoth."
[09:33] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "...ah."
[09:33] <03trenchfoot> 6It's not a bad ah. Just the "ah" of an unexpected wrinkle.
[09:34] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "...this is synergy, I think they call it."
[09:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Synergy with what?"
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> "I have a plan, of sorts. During the peace negotations for Crystal I was mostly silent and just, stood there being intimidating, I guess. I've come up with a plan to change that."
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> "You are aware of my talents with disguises."
[09:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah, that actually reminds me- but go on."
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What if I were to get more into character?"
[09:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks at Tatsuya for a moment.
[09:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Into... what character?"
[09:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're not talking about going around impersonating Reck-"
[09:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "That seemed in bad taste. No. Someone new. Who could be a face in times of peace, alongside everyone else, while keeping the idea of a shadowy, uh, me, out there. I've already convinced people you and Blossom were in two places at once."
[09:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Who, then?"
[09:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'm not sure yet. I'd need to think about it. Maybe impersonate is the wrong word..."
[09:39] <03trenchfoot> "I'd be creating someone."
[09:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You're talking about making up a new person to pretend to be."
[09:40] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Yes."
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Because if people found out you were nice it'd shatter your mystique."
[09:41] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "All I've got so far is 'someone that no one could possibly confuse me with.' I'm not sure what the finished result will be, but, they won't be wanted in Nexus."
[09:41] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "It's hard to maintain a reputation if you constantly undercut it. So, split the workload."
[09:42] <03trenchfoot> "'A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather stones together.'"
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Alright. That makes sense. So someone who's the opposite of what everyone thinks you're like, but which isn't one of us?"
[09:51] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "It's hard to hide being one of us, if I still want to be working to help us out. But. Outgoing. Highly visible. Uh, opposed to theft and assassination..."
[09:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A citizen."
[09:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "The best citizen. Not some crimester layabout."
[09:54] <03trenchfoot> "Ultimately, I think I did some good for Crystal. But. Maybe not publicly. It'd be nice to change that."
[09:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "But in a way that's more socially acceptable. A Tatsuya for the children."
[09:58] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "And, like, pets and stuff. Yeah."
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What would your name be?"
[10:00] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I haven't thought that far, yet. But I think if I'm going completely different, it'll have to be a lady. Imagine being the kind of person who accuses me and her of being the same person. They'll be ridiculed."
[10:01] <03trenchfoot> "And I'm all about shadows, darkness, et cetera, on account of the stealthiness... some kind of, hm. Shining something?"
[10:02] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Brilliant?"
[10:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "How worried are you about having a name that says 'I am Solar Anathema'?"
[10:03] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'll still be travelling with you and supporting you. It would be hard to do that and also pretend that I'm simply a normal travelling peasant, pay no attention."
[10:04] <03trenchfoot> "Maybe a project for the future. But, that's not a problem I think I need to solve, yet."
03[10:04] * banana is now known as banana|split
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, it'll also be harder for us to be publicly Anathema down in Nexus or whatever, too."
[10:08] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I can see that." 6He curls his knees up to his face, still sitting sidelong in the armchair, hand firmly on chin. "But... hm."
[10:09] <03trenchfoot> "It may be confusing, but this character ought to have a name of their own. They can then, additionally, take on their own pseudonyms as circumstances dictate."
[10:09] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "A double assumed name. Doubly untrackable."
[10:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's just..."
[10:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't know. Pretending to be a totally made-up person, for hours at a time? With their own personality and mannerisms and so on?"
[10:10] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "It sounds like a challenge."
[10:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's a good point."
[10:11] <03trenchfoot> "I bet I can do it."
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He should play an instrument or something. We could make a band."
[10:12] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I should ask Ir what she's looking for in accompaniment. Hopefully she won't be angry with me about 'trying to replace her,' or something."
[10:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wrinkles his nose. "That's ridiculous. She couldn't possibly think that."
[10:15] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Last I checked, she also thought we weren't her friends, or that we'd abandon her. So."
[10:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...that's different."
[10:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And I think she thinks it less now, even if she doesn't realize it. She's coming with us, after all."
[10:18] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "That's good to hear. Still, I'll talk with her before I create this 'character.' And Blossom, come to think. Wouldn't do to have them wake up to a stranger on the ship."
[10:18] <03trenchfoot> "Speaking of... how is Blossom?"
[10:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wh- how would I know? I haven't been- I haven't seen her. I haven't seen her in a month. In a while. I haven't seen her."
[10:20] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "You need to practice."
[10:20] <03trenchfoot> "You're a terrible liar."
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm trying to write her a song."
[10:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's fine, I just need to learn how to play and write music first."
[10:22] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "It seems like there's someone on the ship you could consult about that."
[10:22] <03trenchfoot> "Unless you've already tried that."
[10:23] <03trenchfoot> "Also, this is the part where I say 'that sounds difficult, if not impossible,' while planning to create a personality from scratch."
[10:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Blossom and I spent some time with Ir right after she got the keyharp up here and she just laughed at us for ten seconds."
[10:25] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "She truly has accepted friendship."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Anyway I have an idea for a song, I just need to figure out how to make it work."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This reminds me, though."
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If you're going to spend all your time pretending to be someone else, that means you'll have less time to dress up like Blossom, right?"
[10:28] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya just winks.
[10:29] <03trenchfoot> 6Then he grows a little more serious. "Just listen for the voice. It's - imitation is hard. I could fake it to a crowd who's heard her maybe once or twice."
[10:30] <03trenchfoot> "This is aside from the more general idea that impersonating someone while they're on a ship with you is kind of weird."
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Being able to flawlessly impersonate people is sort of a persistent ethical dilemma, isn't it?"
[10:31] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I generally try to avoid ethics by not thinking about anything at all, but sometimes I slip up."

[10:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll be having a perfectly nice conversation and then she just casually says the saddest thing I've ever heard and I don't want to let on but I think I end up, I don't know. It puts me in a mood."

I was about to say 'They shouldn't be' but then I thought about that instead, and the words came out of my mouth." 
[10:43] <03trenchfoot> "Having responsibility for a person is uncomfortable and mostly bad. I'm never going to have kids."
[10:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I mean, you'd only be responsible for them until they surpassed you in martial prowess, which if recent events are to be believed means you've only got to wait until they're 9 or so."

[09:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Heavensward's adrift in a raging storm, boiling thunderheads and razor vortices hedging it in from all directions! Upon its prow perches a rampant wind dragon, her four wings folded across her body and an invincible chrysalis of swirling air sheathing her from feathered head to taloned toe. Between her and you are a trio of her servitors, ancient, feathered wind bears whose 
[09:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12martial arts thus far have proved next to useless against a quartet of solar exalted.
[09:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12The dragon's mad laughter has died down for the moment - all there is to hear is the howling of the storm and the clash of battle.
[09:13] <03Crion> 4Ir holds Iscariot, now a lance, across her body, guarding. Waiting.
[09:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Two of the bears have been soundly defeated - they've drawn back into a sort of meditative repose, their bodies diffuse and translucent. One yet menaces you!
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya's essence blade comes arcing down at the last of the bears to remain dangerous, but it goes skating off the creature's thick, partly-feathered hide! For its part, the bear claps its paws together, draws a deep breath in through its snout, and then roars!
[09:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12An unavoidable (certainly if you're mortal) shockwave of concussive force goes rippling outward! Tatsuya rolls smoothly through it and Ir just grits her teeth, but the other two solare are bruised and battered by the impact and aftershock vibrations. 
[09:23] <03trenchfoot> 6Still fatigued from the onslaught on the dragon herself, Tatsuya lands merely a glancing blow, but fortunately was already rolling out of the way of the counterattack. Small victories.
[09:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12The third of the creatures is visibly spent by the exertion. Like its brethren, it folds its hands, takes several steps back towards Garuda, and proceeds to simply watch the four of you with a long-suffering gaze.
[09:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12The first bear rumbles: "We've failed..."
[09:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12The second: "No... it's as it should be."
[09:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya creeps about, Eikichi finishes materializing a crimson firebird in his hands, Ir and Blossom steady themselves, and Garuda's eyes - black from edge to edge, like a shark's - snap open from within the shell of wind.
[09:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12By sheer coincidence, the dragon cackles: "The reckoning comes!" 12Then her wings burst open, and crushing wind cracks across the Heavensward like a tidal wave!
[09:40] <03Crion> 4Reckoning? Ir just lets Iscariot condense into a spear in her hand and points it at the dragon. Then she leans into the wind.
[09:41] <03@Ferrinus> "Ahahaha!" 12cries the dragon, exultant above the Heavensward's prow. "There is no hope! NONE! These skies are mine!"
[09:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom turns, twists - and the pounding windstorm passes over her without so much as ruffling her hair.
[09:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The wind also fails to ruffle Eikichi's hair. What it doesn't fail to do is crash him into the bulkhead where he slides to the ground unconscious, his spell dissipated.
[09:43] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya puts up both arms in a cross and stands against the wind. It buffets him about, but he's right back where he was with no injuries to speak of.
[09:46] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom turns for a brief moment, horrified. But she's a Dragon of Heaven, trained to rule the world. She can gasp and scream his name and cradle him in her arms when the battle's won.
[09:57] <03Crion> 4Ir's faced the best this thing has to offer. She hears someone hit the deck behind her, but in that moment, the Sun comes out -- somehow -- from behind the clouds above and hits her face...and tip of her spear.
[09:58] <03Crion> 4Then there's a sound like a thunderclap and she's leapt across the deck, moving faster than any eye can track, cutting through the wind with a boom of her own, and there's another whirlwind on the board of the Heavensward: furious, lethal, and solar.
[10:00] <03Crion> 4Just like that she's cut the thing to pieces, then shoots into the sky and drives down with her final strike -- not doing any more damage to the already-destroyed dragon, but dissapting it, scattering its wispy pieces.
[10:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12Garuda's laughing and laughing and laughing - and then she's not, because she's too busy folding her wings and lashing out with her talons and summoning shields of solid wind against her impossibly persistent harrier. By the end, though, when her wings have been pried apart like some mollusc's shell and her aura tunneled through and her heart bared, she's begun laughing all over 
[10:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12again.
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12At last, Ir drives straight through the monster, which explodes into a storm of grey-green wind essence that expands and unravels all across the Heavensward's deck. Around you, the dark storm you've been trapped in thins and lightens and slowly opens itself entirely, allowing you to right the ship and get your bearings. The ship itself is in fine shape - the sails are a little ragged 
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12around the edges and there are some unfortunate claw marks across the deck, but it's nothing that can't be repaired or polished over.
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Indeed, the only significant change is that one of the three ancient, ghostly bears is still sitting at the ship's prow, asleep. Your hands pass right through it when you reach out to shake it awake, feeling nothing but an extremely cold wind.
[10:04] <03Crion> 4Ir pauses for a moment, tip of Iscariot buried in the deck, then thumps heavily down into a sitting position, then lies back on the deck, arms spread wide, exhausted.
[10:04] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "...is it over?"
[10:04] <03Crion> 4Staring up at the sky. "Yup."
[10:04] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Everyone okay? Blossom, Eikichi?"
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi:
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's not a typo or anything.
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Y'all alive back there?"
[10:06] <03dammitwho> "Eikichi!" 7Blossom rushes over to his sprawled body and begins checking for serious wounds.
[10:06] <03trenchfoot> 6He looks over to the unconscious Eikichi. "Shit." 6Tatsuya rushes over to check on him if Blossom hasn't gotten there first. "He's still breathing. We're okay."
[10:07] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Cool, cool."
[10:07] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "That was fucking awesome, by the way."
[10:07] <03trenchfoot> "Not the getting attacked part. The murdering it part."
[10:07] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I do my best."
[10:07] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Yes, well done Ir!"
[10:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's got a couple of cracked ribs and he clocked his head pretty hard, but nothing too serious. Just a lot of it.
[10:08] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya, extremely quietly: "i helped."
[10:08] <03Crion> 4Ir gets to her feet slowly. "You did help. That thing was already hurt when I went in on it. Like strangling a damn chicken."
[10:09] <03dammitwho> 7She lifts Eikichi in her arms. "I'll take care of him until he wakes up." 7She's going to carry Eikichi to his stateroom. This will also give her an opportunity to see if he's written her any more love poems.
[10:09] <03trenchfoot> "Largest chicken I've ever seen."
[10:10] <03Crion> 4To Blossom, who surely is gonna be playing nurse here: "Left a couple bottles of his favorite medicine outside his door if that's what he needs. Otherwise, I'm gonna find some place to dock us for the rest of the day. Skies around here aren't too friendly. We can set out again at dawn tomorrow."
[10:10] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Got it. Was just about to suggest the same thing."
[10:11] <03trenchfoot> "I'm heading to my room. Wake me if you need me."
[10:11] <03Crion> "Yup."
[10:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Blossom does in fact find more writing on Eikichi's desk.
[10:16] <03dammitwho> 7What is it! What is it!!! She's brewing Ir's helpfully provided tea so this doesn't count as just snooping.
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's a bunch of crossed-out stuff, and some purely pictorial diagrams of a great block subdivided into tenths and hundredths with exacting care. And then a single blank page with a single line written on it.
[10:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Aaaaaaaaagh."
[10:22] <03Crion> 4Some guys just have a way with the written word.
[10:23] <03dammitwho> 7Hmm. She'll carefully replace the paper so it doesn't look like she was reading it. "Ah! You're awake!"
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "A dragon?"
[10:23] <03dammitwho> "Drink this."
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mmm-" 10What is it?
[10:25] <03dammitwho> 7The ginseng and chamomile that Ir left by the door to Eikichi's room.
[10:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "...thank you. Is everyone else okay?"
[10:27] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Fine. Ir pierced its heart with one blow... but it only dematerialized."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's weird."
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Dematerializing I mean. The Ir thing makes sense."
[10:28] <03Crion> 4It was more like five blows. But it's fine. It's fine. Sounds better if it's one blow, anyway.
[10:29] <03trenchfoot> 6One attack, five blows. The important part is that it was annihilated, other than the dematerializing and not dying part.
[10:29] <03Crion> 4Ir's dragged a barstool up to the helm and has taken off her armor, hanging out on the bridge in just leathers and her shift while she flies them into some safe sky harbor for the night. Can't be wearing that stuff all the time.
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi is more than happy to have Blossom play nursemaid, and their combined efforts and a night's rest will see Eikichi awaken the next day good as news.
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10as new.
[10:32] <03Crion> 4When they all wake the next day, Ir will have nestled them in some remote cliffside while she surveys the ship and sees what repairs it needs.
[10:32] <03trenchfoot> 13The next morning, the Exalted wake up to the smell of a delicious breakfast and the sound of someone humming an unfamiliar tune. In the kitchen, someone seems to have snuck onto the Heavensward - there's a stranger in there, a young woman with long pink hair and... a maid outfit? She seems pleased with herself. "Breakfast is ready!"
[10:32] <03Crion> 4So far, it looks all cosmetic.
[10:33] <03Crion> "What the."
[10:33] <03trenchfoot> 13It's hard to tell where she's from, specifically, but she's got wide blue eyes and an impish grin. Some jewelry hangs from one of her bangs off to the side of her face, and she's got a brooch attached to the collar of the maid's uniform. "Hi! I made omelettes!"
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi walks into the mess and galley and gapes.
[10:34] <03Crion> 4Ir's hand flexes, resisting the immediate urge to reach for Iscariot. "The fuck you get onboard. BLOSSOM, WE GOT--"
[10:34] <03Crion> "..."
[10:34] <03Crion> "Waaaaait a second."
[10:34] <03Crion> "Are you--" 4She turns to Eikichi. "Is she--"
[10:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Tatsuya!!"
[10:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You snuck into my closet!"
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "Sunlit-Dreaming Ying, at your service!" 13She bows.
[10:37] <03dammitwho> "Wow." 7She glances at Eikichi, for some reason. "Wow."
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> "Sorry about that! Tatsuya didn't think to buy any outfits before we left Crystal, so..."
[10:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's... fine. It suits you. Your name was what?"
[10:40] <03Crion> 4Ir looks from 'Ying' to Eikichi back to 'Ying,' blinks twice, then shakes her head and walks behind the bar to get some Icehome's Welcome from the stock. For her coffee.
[10:40] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "Sunlit-Dreaming Ying. Hi!"
[10:41] <03Crion> 4She'll wordlessly offer some to Blossom.
[10:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods slowly. "Do you know who we are? I'm not... sure how to..."
[10:41] <03dammitwho> "You can make omelettes, so: welcome aboard."
[10:41] <03Crion> 4Ir takes a look at where she made them. "You know, Blossom, when we get the chance we should expand the kitchen."
[10:42] <03Crion> 4Since it's not really a kitchen, at the moment. More of a range shoved in a corner, siphoning off the Essence reactor.
[10:42] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Yep! Eikichi, Blossom, Ir. It's, ah, kind of hard to describe - I remember everything Tatsuya does, but thinking about that stuff kind of just makes my head hurt, so I stopped. But you're his friends, so you're my friends too! Um, if you want to be."
[10:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's already eating so he doesn't have to think about the logistics of this. With his mouth full: "'S a galley."
[10:43] <03Crion> "Not if you're from the North."
[10:43] <03Crion> "You'll be shocked to hear most of the time we just fuckin' call them 'walls,' too."
[10:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Good point. How soon until we're out of the North?"
[10:44] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, to Sunlit-Dreamin' Ying: "That sounds good to me. What are your plans, Ying?"
[10:45] <03Crion> 4Ir shrugs. "Shorter than weeks, longer than days. Depends how many more wind elementals we happen to piss off."
03[10:45] * banana|tobed is now known as banana
[10:46] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Hmmm... I was going to practice some things... I've got a lot of ideas for stuff that Tatsuya couldn't do. And reorganize the kitchen. And, if that dragon comes back, I should... do we have any bows around here? Just in case!"
[10:47] <03trenchfoot> "Oh my gosh. And wounds - Eikichi, are you okay now? You got hit pretty hard!"
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm fine. I had exceptional care."
[10:48] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Oh!" 13She reddens. "Oh. Um, sorry!"
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10His eyes narrow. "Did you also take the hospitaler gown?"
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Did Tatsuya. Whatever."
[10:49] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying looks extremely interested: "You have a...?" 13Then tamps it down. "No! Just this."
[10:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's not finished yet. I couldn't find a hat."
[10:50] <03Crion> 4Ir sneaks another shot of Welcome into her coffee, and puts on another pot.
[10:50] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Oh, hats are simple. You can just make an illusion out of another hat, or, heck, a hairband if you're not too picky. Or if you're really good!"
[10:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom folds her hands and watches Ying and Eikichi talk about clothes with delight.
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods. "It's not the same if you're not standing in front of a mirror mixing and matching though..."
[10:55] <03trenchfoot> 13Eyes shining: "I KNOW! Oh, golly, when we land I'm gonna get to go shopping, and also return this to you, but anyway! Something with epaulettes on it. Maybe a cravatte?"
[10:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We should have uniforms made!"
[10:56] <03Crion> 4Oh, Sun.
[10:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "For formal occasions. Dress uniforms. Think about it!"
[10:56] <03Crion> 4She almost chokes on her coffee.
[10:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "See, Ir likes the idea."
[10:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi tilts his head, contemplating Ir. "...what size hat do you wear?"
[10:58] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Yessss~! It'll be great for first impressions! And also, you know, just walkin' around the ship, feeling good."
[10:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Looking cute."
[10:58] <03trenchfoot> "Feeling cute!"
[10:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, I like you."
[10:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...I spent a lot of my life wearing a uniform. I've got no interest in stepping into another one."
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You've got to have a hat, though."
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Be reasonable."
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're the captain!"
[11:00] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "It's all personal preference! Nobody's gonna make you wear anything you don't want to." 13She pauses. "Except for maybe the hat."
[11:03] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Blossom, what's your take on uniforms? Not mandatory, obviously, but heck, we probably all ought to match if we're gonna wear any, right?"
[11:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Also, can we start giving ourselves medals?"
[11:04] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Why even wear a uniform if we can't pin medals to 'em? It's not like we haven't earned any! Oh, but I'm going to have to keep track of two sets..."
[11:05] <03Crion> 4Ir sighs. "I suppose a hat would be fine."
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So wait."
[11:06] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying claps in excitement. Is there any paper in this area, or is she going to have to run and get some?
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ying, where'd you learn to cook?"
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Because I've seen Tatsuya cook. And he can't."
[11:08] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I... instinct? He doesn't know how to use a bow or be a doctor or dance, either, but I do. This is another one of those things that just makes my head hurt to think about too much, so I don't."
[11:08] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, gravely: "I want to see Eikichi wearing a uniform."
[11:10] <03Crion> 4Ir starts in on a second cup of coffee and puts the rest of the pot out for the others. They don't have a lot of beans so they won't be brewing it too often, but this seems like, uh, a special occasion.
[11:10] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I gotta get some paper and sketch out a hat design! Be right back~" 13She dashes out of the room. Tatsuya doesn't have any pen or paper, but Eikichi does. Sorry for thieving again, but also, not sorry.
[11:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She could've asked.
[11:11] <03trenchfoot> 13It's better to ask forgiveness than for permission. I'm pretty sure Sun Tzu said that.
[11:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Blossom: "What sort of uniform?"
[11:13] <03dammitwho> "Well, I mean, um--"
[11:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi puts his head in his hand, watching Blossom expectantly.
[11:17] <03dammitwho> 7She swallows nervously and coughs, looking around to see if Ir has left the room. "You've already got the maid uniform, and the hospitaler uniform,"
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And you didn't even know I had those!"
[11:18] <03Crion> 4Oh, Ir's still right here. If Blossom gives her a look she can find something to do at the helm, though.
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I guess I should just take this as license to use my imagination."
[11:19] <03dammitwho> 7No, if anything Blossom gives her a look that's like 'save me from having to answer this question'. I'm assuming that she is cruelly denied that by Ir, who enjoys watching nerds flail in love.
[11:20] <03Crion> 4Ir sips the coffee.
[11:25] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying bursts back into the room. "Pictures~! I drew this! It's got the hat, and um, some... additional ideas?" 13The drawing is... technically competent, but also... http://i.imgur.com/fmG1sTT.jpg
[11:27] <03Crion> 4This time Ir does choke on the coffee.
[11:27] <03Crion> "I'm not...a fuckin' pirate!"
[11:27] <03Crion> "And I don't wear belly shirts!"
[11:28] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "You also don't use a sword and pistol! I took some creative liberties!"
[11:28] <03trenchfoot> "Also did you notice that the shirt is actually a skull"
[11:28] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is frantically coughing.
03[11:28] * banana is now known as banana|split
[11:28] <03Crion> "Yes I noticed that the shirt is actually a skull"
[11:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's just nodding calmly. "You have a good eye."
[11:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then Eikichi looks at Blossom. "Is that what you had in mind?"
[11:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "The hat, though! What do you think about the hat, Ir? I wasn't sure if you'd prefer a bicorn or tricorn hat... and then I got carried away while I thought about it."
[11:34] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Tricorn."
[11:34] <03Crion> "But no skulls."
[11:34] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom takes a calming drink of whatever this northern mixed coffee is. "I wasn't really expecting--"
[11:34] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying nods rapidly. "Tricorn it is! No skulls, that's a promise!"
[11:37] <03Crion> 4She discreetly adds another dab of Welcome to Blossom's cup. She'll need it. "And try to keep it one color."
[11:38] <03dammitwho> "I've only seen clothes like that at parties..."
[11:38] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "...preference? Black, navy blue, white, something else?"
[11:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Black or white."
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Suddenly Eikichi just busts out laughing.
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I just realized."
[11:39] <03trenchfoot> 13She hums one bar of another song while nodding.
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The reason the Haslanti had such low-flying kites and zeppelins and so forth."
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Is because if they went too high... they had to deal with the air dragon."
[11:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Maybe we should swing by and demand payment for liberating their skies."
[11:40] <03dammitwho> "She's still alive, though." 7Blossom points out.
[11:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12So after yesterday's debacle, the Heavensward is adrift a bit, but basically undamaged and still on its heading towards the near-eastern threshold. Right now you're still in what would be Haslanti airspace if the Haslanti ever dared to fly this high, though, and you've still got an old, wise(-looking) wind bear dozing fatly at the front of the ship.
[11:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh right. Bother."
[11:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12The next time someone goes out to look at it it'll grumble to itself and rouse, so lemme know when that happens.
[11:41] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "They don't know that... but, we should probably take care of it permanently before we get payment."
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Ugh, no, I want to go somewhere warm. Winter's coming."
[11:43] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "We were already heading south, weren't we? Nexus!"
[11:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Good idea. I'm going to go up and make sure there's no more storms around."
[11:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Minutes later, Eikichi calling back into the ship: "There's a bear on the deck!"
[11:46] <03dammitwho> "Still?"
[11:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bear: "Mggrrmmbll.. wha...? Mmrm. Ahem."
[11:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Why are you still here?"
[11:47] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Figured he'd have gone away by now."
[11:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Bear: "Aherrm. Ahem. Mrrm. Yes." 12It blinks owlishly at you, which is a little more than a metaphor because of the ballroom mask effect the feathers around its eyes, snout, and jowls give it. "Greetings."
[11:48] <03Crion> 4Ir's got Iscariot as a lance, but isn't waving it around or anything.
[11:48] <03Crion> 4It's just one freaking wind bear.
[11:48] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom stands next to Eikichi, hands on hips. "Hello. Who are you, and why are you still here?"
[11:48] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying heads up on deck after Eikichi's message. "Um, hi?"
[11:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12The bear's wearing a big medallion with the old realm character for Wind painted onto it, and has got a long flowing scarf and a tall, boxy official's hat that ties under its chin - his chin, probably, if the voice is to be taken as dispositive. It might've wore longer robes or something once but they look to have mostly been worn away by time or destroyed by the growth of razor-edged 
[11:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12feathers.
[11:50] <03@Ferrinus> "The Lady of the Vortex bids you salutations, hrrm, and congratulations, with regards, to holding your own against her." 12The bear squints for a moment, then smacks his lips a few times, then continues. "By so doing... you've earned the right to traverse the northern skies."
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You don't say."
[11:50] <03Crion> 4Ir grunts.
[11:50] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Wow, thanks!"
[11:50] <03Crion> 4'Holding our own.' Lil fucker.

[10:43] <03Quaker> No one comes to his part of the lot. 
[10:46] <03Quaker> They wouldn’t have much reason to, anyway - it’s just his office, and a few storage buildings tucked away in a far corner, surrounded by the giant concrete pillars and ramps of the freeways. It’s not even an active malice that keeps them away, or the night guard who receives a healthy stipend to his wage to make sure he keeps them away. It’s the feeling that time has passed, in some unpleasant and unplaceable way. To dwell here too 
[10:46] <03Quaker> long in this place, you risk catching a glimpse of something that has long outlived its creators, its purpose, and its time. Here, the forgotten things of the past moulder, unused and unlooked for. 
[10:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10My ears are burning.
[10:50] <03Quaker> His servants have left Baron Hollywood alone, again. It’s gone like this for so long that ignoring the schedule has become the schedule, and the place he stays instead of his house has become the house. 
[10:52] <03Quaker> He’s perfectly free to do whatever he wants, tonight. Again. 
[10:53] <03Quaker> Nora has dropped the day’s mail through the front door’s slot. There are no messages on his answering machine. 
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That much he'll take responsibility for. It's been a slow couple of weeks, and Baron Frost has been in a foul mood for about that long. It gets so you resent the company. He cuts them loose as soon as he can, which is as soon as they come in. They've been handling his affairs remotely, anyway - email and call forwarding and the like. He hopes they're having a good time, but mostly 
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10he's glad that however worried they are, he doesn't have to see it. So tonight it's just him, Jack, and Weeds on Netflix.
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A lot of nights are like that.
[10:56] <03Quaker> As the sound of really, really bad television fills the office, it drowns out the low hum of the city outside. The cars, the people, the dust - actually, there’s not been that much dust, lately. It’s been raining for a week straight. He can hear it against the roof. 
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Tail end of the rainy season. Winter sticks around in California like a bum on the couch. Whatever. Noise is all the same anyway.
[11:04] <03Quaker> Nobody calls him. 
[11:04] <03Quaker> Hours pass. 
[11:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10At some point he switches to X-Files.
[11:05] <03Quaker> The next time Wilson looks at a clock, it’s 4:45 in the morning. 
[11:06] <03Quaker> When he wakes up the next night, it’s raining even harder. No new mail. He can do what he wants. 
[11:06] <03Quaker> Well…there’s still the few envelopes that arrived yesterday. But nothing since then. 
[11:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson cracks his neck. Checks his phone. Texts from Nora and Cora, which he answers with terse consolations. Slow period. Things'll pick up come summer.
[11:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Around midnight he gets bored enough of TV to check the envelopes.
[11:11] <03Quaker> Groundskeepers’ pay is due. It’s all automated, so he just needs to sign. There’s a few obligatory memos from the studio -everyone even tangentially involved at a high enough level gets these reports, even though it’s been quite some time since he worked in the industry beyond cashing a paycheck. 
[11:11] <03Quaker> Nora has put the last one in a manila folder. It glitters faintly in the darkened office. Gilded…
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He still reads scripts on occasion. Though lately he's even been outsourcing that to Nora. So he signs the invoice, skims the memos, and then-
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ah hell.
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's time for one of these again already?
[11:14] <03Quaker> Wilson,
[11:15] <03Quaker> We’re having a small occasion at the ballet next week. Please check with Rosa for the details and leave your house. 
[11:15] <03Quaker> Yours warmly,
[11:15] <03Quaker> Ana
[11:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ana sent this?
[11:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Damn. Looks like Wilson's not the only one who knows how to delegate.
[11:17] <03Quaker> It’s dictated. Her handwriting is much worse. 
[11:23] <03Quaker> There’s a knock at the door. 
[11:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sure, sure. When it rains...
[11:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He stands up, smooths out his rumpled shirt, grabs the suit jacket off the coatrank. He's only a couple drinks deep tonight so he should be fairly lucid. Unlocks the door and opens it. Who's there?
[11:28] <03Quaker> A young girl, peering up from a black raincoat two sizes too small. She spins her umbrella in a circle, raindrops flying off. Politely, she hasn’t aimed it at him while she does so. “Good evening, Baron. Do you have a moment to talk about Jesus?” 
[11:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He know her? She human?
[11:29] <03Quaker> Her tone is gently ironic, of course. He does know her. Presbyter Sauer must be making the rounds of North Los Angeles again. 
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Presbyter! Pleasure to see you. Whiskey? Brandy? Gin?"
[11:34] <03Quaker> “What are you drinking?” 
[11:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What do you want this time you Michelle Trachtenberg-looking "Tonight? Scotch and water. Should I pour two more?"
[11:36] <03Quaker> She nods, and scoots inside, taking off her rain boots. “Yes, please. No need to open a new bottle on my account.” 
[11:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10So he does. It's fine scotch. Nothing special. He blew through his last bottle of special Scotch on the war with San Diego. Nothing's been special enough to merit replacing it yet. "I hear Presbyter Vincent's been settling in."
[11:40] <03Quaker> “Really? I hear she’s on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Or a heart attack. Or going postal.” 
[11:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "We've got the same information, then. That's a martyr's job they posted her to."
[11:41] <03Quaker> “Hopefully not, seeing as it’s a posthumous designation. Can I sit down? What are you watching?” 
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The coasters Wilson puts their glasses on cut crop circles into the dust on the desk. "X-Files. Take a seat, please." 10The furnishings in here are extremely nice and comfortable, assuming you're not prone to sneezing. Plenty of leather chairs and a big squashy couch against the far wall. Wilson sits behind the desk.
[11:46] <03Quaker> Sauer turns the chair to face the television and settles in, her legs not quite reaching the ground. She watches quietly for a few minutes, every now and then sipping her scotch. “What’s this one about, again?” 
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He doesn't bear the Presbyter any ill will, but the invitation has aggravated his already bad mood in ways he can't articulate, and then here some comes, putting the 'botherer' in God-botherer. "This is Død Kalm, Season 2 Episode 19. They're trapped on a ship and aging too fast." 10There's David Duchovny in stage wrinkles as he speaks. "This episode was supposed to be a break 
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> for the crew. They'd already booked the Canadian ship for earlier episodes. Didn't work out that way."
[11:51] <03Quaker> She must have caught something in his tone. She nods, and watches some more. “I’m not putting you out or anything, am I?” 
[11:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Me? Nah. Just haven't had a lot of company recently. I've forgotten some of my manners."
[11:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't see you too often, Presbyter. So I gotta ask: why is this night different from all the other nights?"
[11:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Passover's actually next week, but still. You take your licks where you can get em.
[11:55] <03Quaker> “My outreach route rotated to North L.A. a few weeks ago. So…goodbye Culver City, hello Hollywood.” 
[11:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Been by Bixby's yet?"
[11:57] <03Quaker> “I was kicked out of one of his parties, if that counts.” 
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It does in my book."
[12:01] <03Quaker> She looks at the television. “Do they ever…investigate wizards? Magic? Or is it just aliens and mutants and such.” 
[12:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Occasionally. Some demons, witches, cults. There's a stigmata episode next season."
[12:04] <03Quaker> “Mm.” She wiggles her feet, absentmindedly. “You ever get into that stuff? The occult?” 
[12:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not if I can help it. Can't always help it, though. There were sorcerers on the field in San Diego, for instance."
[12:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Even as inactive as I am, you see things. I don't need to tell you that. But it's never been a particular interest of mine. Why do you ask?"
[12:08] <03Quaker> “It’s just been on my mind. We’re remodeling a wing of the library at Saint Chrys’s, so i’ve been going through the collection and making sure everything’s still there in proper condition. Lots of old things. Not really my field.” 
[12:10] <03Quaker> “I guess technically I’m supposed to ask you for money, but…” She shrugs. “I hate begging.” 
[12:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How much to escape damnation?"
[12:13] <03Quaker> “No, it’s fine. I’ll get it from somebody else. Forget I brought it up. I know you don’t go to services. Just a lot of….uh…” She looks up, like she’s trying to re-establish her train of thought. “How are you doing? Out here. With all the movie stuff.” 
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Doing well! Doing well. Nora and Cora take care of the knucklehead stuff for me, and it's mostly all knucklehead stuff. So I have a lot of time to myself."
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How's the lecture circuit?"
[12:23] <03Quaker> “I haven’t been on it the last couple of years. The last class inducted was five new students. No time for independent research. Just a lot of babysitting and survey courses. How’s the lifestyle of the rich and famous?” 
[12:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts. "It gets worse every year. I don't know how more people don't snap. We're one good studio closure away from turning into South Korea."
[12:30] <03Quaker> She raises an eyebrow in confusion. 
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Highest suicide rate in the industrialized world. Look it up."
[12:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Celebrities, too. Movie stars, singers..."
[12:32] <03Quaker> “Oh…” 
[12:33] <03Quaker> She stays silent for a while. 
[12:34] <03Quaker> “Has the whole studio system changed a lot in the past few decades?” 
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You didn't come here to pick my brain about show business."
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That edge Sauer recognized in his voice crept back in somewhere.
[12:39] <03Quaker> “I, uh.” She swallows. “Jotham Bixby and his kind are hard to talk to, sometimes. Even if they decide to be nice to you. Very….self-assured. Unchanging.” 
03[12:40] * GreatClownVoxPVoxD is now known as VoxPVxoD
[12:43] <03VoxPVxoD> "I try not to, if I can help it." 10I worked pretty hard to get to a spot where I could help it.
[12:45] <03VoxPVxoD> "But I can't imagine I make better conversation."
[12:46] <03Quaker> She seems to be thinking something over. 
[12:47] <03Quaker> Her eyes focus on the floor. He can see her jaw clenched. 
[12:47] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Wilson lets her have the silence. He won't rush her.
[12:48] <03Quaker> Then, it passes, as if she remembers herself. Sauer finishes her drink and gently puts the glass back on the desk on the coaster. 
[12:51] <03Quaker> The Presbyter stands, and bows. “Forgive me, Baron. Too much time in the company of the informal and unserious has dulled my manners. I clearly am in no mood to be making my rounds. Please excuse this breach of professionalism. You are aware of the good work Saint Crysanthus’s Seminary does in the community, and how important our research and archival work is to the wider scientific effort. If you feel compelled to make a donation to 
[12:51] <03Quaker> support us, please contact my office. I’ll leave you to your peace.” 
[12:55] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Ah, hell. "Look. I can't promise you much. I'm not a deacon, or a friend. But if you've got something you need to get off your chest it won't leave this room. It's not like anybody'd ask me anyway."
[12:56] <03VoxPVxoD> "If not, that's your affair too. I'll tell you good night and I'll have Cora cut your seminary a check first thing tomorrow."
[12:57] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Wilson shrugs. He's had to build a lot of physical barriers to his solitude because once you get in a room with him, he's pretty easy to wear down.
[12:57] <03Quaker> She’s still stiff. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to….presume. The rumors about you. I just thought…” 
[12:58] <03Quaker> “You have a reputation for not enjoying the company of others. It’s just that I’ve felt that way, too, lately.” 
[12:59] <03VoxPVxoD> "I've earned that reputation honestly, I suppose. It took me a while to realize it was me, though."
[13:00] <03VoxPVxoD> "It's easy enough to think, circles we move in, that it's not that you don't want to talk to anyone. Just that you don't want to talk to them."
[13:01] <03VoxPVxoD> "For you, maybe it is."
[13:01] <03VoxPVxoD> "Or maybe it's just a mood. Some unresolved problem. Could be lots of things."
[13:02] <03Quaker> “Yes. It’s probably a lot of things. Although if you don’t want to talk to anyone, I imagine that includes me. So I’ll not unburden myself to you for my own sake. I have my own confessor.” 
[13:02] <03Quaker> “You fought at Bressi Ranch, didn’t you? Against San Diego?” 
[13:02] <03VoxPVxoD> "Yeah."
[13:03] <03Quaker> She puts her hand out. “Then, thank you.” 
[13:04] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Wilson'll stand to shake her hand. "You think it was worth it?"
[13:07] <03Quaker> “Yes. You helped me more than you know. The Church is…there are those of us who are comfortable with change. Not just politically. I don’t care who gets what barony. But the range of acceptable thought has widened. More than we thought possible.” 
[13:09] <03VoxPVxoD> "I hope you're right. It's a nice thought. Hey, do you know what's going on with this thing at the ballet?"
[13:10] <03Quaker> “Were you invited?” 
[13:10] <03VoxPVxoD> "I was."
[13:15] <03Quaker> “I think it’s just an informal gathering. Were you surprised you were invited?” 
[13:16] <03VoxPVxoD> "I'm surprised they remembered me." 10Though in truth they barely did.
[13:17] <03Quaker> “Why?” 
[13:18] <03VoxPVxoD> "I don't know. It wasn't a fully formed thought."
[13:20] <03Quaker> “I think that’s tecnically my job description.” 
[13:21] <03Quaker> technically*
[13:21] <03VoxPVxoD> "Remembering people or forming thoughts?"
[13:23] <03Quaker> “Taking other people’s half-formed thoughts and fleshing them out.” 
[13:25] <03VoxPVxoD> "...I should really call the Seneschal before it gets too late."
[13:26] <03Quaker> She nods. “Of course. Again, if you find yourself interested in our work. My secretary’s phone is always on. Goodnight, Baron. Thanks for the drink.” 
[13:27] <03VoxPVxoD> "Thanks for the company, Presbyter. Stay dry."
[13:28] <03Quaker> He can see her fiddle with the umbrella, through the blinds, after he closes the door behind her. 
[13:28] <03VoxPVxoD> 10He'll pour himself another drink, down it at the bar, and then pour yet another before finding out if Rosa Isaacs has changed her number since, what was it, end of last year?
[13:29] <03Quaker> She has not. Wilson gets the time and place in less than a minute after she picks up. 
[13:30] <03VoxPVxoD> "Anything else I should know?"
[13:31] <03Quaker> “It’s black-tie. They won’t let you in the door if you’re not dressed properly.” 
[13:31] <03VoxPVxoD> "Ghouls, yes or no?"
[13:31] <03Quaker> “Not even our rules, actually. The ballet’s. Let me know if you need a tailor.” 
[13:32] <03Quaker> “Of course. They won’t be allowed to sit in the private box provided for you, though.” 
[13:33] <03VoxPVxoD> "They'll get over it. Anyone fun RSVP'd?"
[13:34] <03Quaker> “I think Blythe Sulzberger will be there. Do you two still talk?” 
[13:36] <03VoxPVxoD> "Not as much as we used to." 10Probably been about five years or so since they spoke to each other besides pleasantries at one of these cotillions.
[13:36] <03VoxPVxoD> "Bren?"
[13:37] <03Quaker> “No.” 
[13:38] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Wilson's shoulders relax a little. "I'll be there. Just need to have someone sew the sleeves back onto my tuxedo."
[13:39] <03Quaker> “I’ll send my seamstress. Goodnight, Wilson.” 
[13:39] <03VoxPVxoD> "Take care."
[13:40] <03Quaker> The sun will be coming up in a quarter of an hour. 
[13:43] <03VoxPVxoD> 10Excellent. One more drink for the road, a text to Nora and Cora - <We've got a ballet to go to. Let's see if we can remember how to look presentable.> 10- and then he opens the closet with its fold-out cot. You cut it close enough, and dawn steals your consciousness before you need to stop and think about why it scared you to be forgotten, or how the way that dead little girl's 
[13:43] <03VoxPVxoD> 10jaw moved just a bit like Laura's.
[13:48] <03Quaker> Where does he sleep? 
[13:50] <03VoxPVxoD> 10The cot in the closet is fine. He doesn't unfold the blanket even though he's actually kicking out enough body heat to make it worth it. He sleeps better cold.
[13:54] <03Quaker> Does he dream wakig up in the middle of the day? Or is this real? 
[13:55] <03VoxPVxoD> 10He doesn't know. It doesn't occur to him to think about it. Might be a sign of a dream. His main thought is: what's woken him?
[13:57] <03Quaker> She’s standing above him, looking down at his sleeping form. 
[13:58] <03VoxPVxoD> 10His voice is thick, as if decades of dust were clogging his throat. "What-"
[13:59] <03Quaker> Her eyes are without pupils. Bottomless pools of gold. Her hand reaches out to touch his face. 
[14:00] <03VoxPVxoD> 10He flinches. His arms feel heavy. He's too slow to stop her.
[14:02] <03Quaker> Her fingertips touch his lips…and go past them. He can feel her fingers move past his teeth, past his tongue, her whole hand reaching into his throat. 
[14:02] <03VoxPVxoD> 10please
[14:03] <03Quaker> He can feel her fingers around his heart. And he can feel them as they turn into talons, sinking into him-
[14:03] <03Quaker> And Wilson wakes up. It’s the next evening. There’s nothing in here with him. 
[14:05] <03Quaker> And he can do anything he wants. 
[14:06] <03Quaker> NEXT TIME: A night at the ballet

[09:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12So the squared circle is currently south of Icehome and east of Gethamane. They've landed the Heavensward on the edge of a mountain chain small and short enough that it doesn't even get a name on the big Creation-wide maps, intent on resting and resupplying on their way to the near-east.
[09:15] <03Crion> 4Shit always has a way of going sideways on us.
[09:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi and Ying are either on or still near the ship. It's the night of the new moon, and that means the sorcerer's got big, important, and profoundly evil plans to enact. I'm not clear on whether Ying is interested in watching or has something else going on, but it's Ir and Blossom who've got the most immediate problem.
[09:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's profoundly ETHICAL, actually. Eikichi's going to be respectful and everything.
[09:16] <03Crion> 4Uh huh.
[09:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Which is to say that they've each got a terrified hunter or forager or something sitting behind them on their mounts (one horse, one golden emas bird), a swarm of hobgoblins boiling out of the woods at them, and a pair of silver-clad lancers riding emerald-shelled dragonflies arcing overhead.
[09:18] <03Crion> 4Shouting to Blossom over the wind as they rush away: "YOU KNOW WHO THESE GUYS ARE?!"
[09:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Perhaps one or both of you do-
[09:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Unless Eikichi's specifically thrown her out, she's content to watch him work. Probably later tonight she'll be meditating and returning to being Tatsuya, and she'll have to leave him some instructions. So she's writing away in a notebook, with Eikichi's work as background noise.
[09:20] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom shouts back. "FAE! HATE IRON, CAN'T BREAK OATHS!"
[09:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "WELL SHIT."
[09:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Unless you had some reason to do otherwise, I'm assuming that each solar's taken one fleeing mortal. Of the two, the man's just screaming and the woman's muttering "no on no..."
[09:24] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...YOU THINK WE CAN TAKE 'EM?!"
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Does Ying know anything about diviner's decks?
[09:27] <03dammitwho> "YES!" 7She snarls gleefully.
[09:28] <03Crion> 4Ir grins back and shifts in her saddle--
[09:29] <03trenchfoot> 13Some! The major arcana, mostly - Tatsuya never bothered going any deeper than that, and she hasn't had time to do it herself.
[09:30] <03Crion> 4She elbows the screaming dude in the ribs. Sun, man up. When she gets his attention, she hands him the reins. "Errant -- that's his name, the horse, Errant -- is going to get you to safety. Hold on and be respectful. When we're done here, we'll find you. Get me?"
[09:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Man: "You- ye can't-" 12Probably too terrified and in too much of a rush to have noticed and processed Iscariot.
[09:34] <03Crion> 4Her grin widens and Iscariot becomes unmissable as it lengthens into a lance. "Oh, I can. Seeya soon."
[09:35] <03Crion> 4Then she rolls sideways off the still-charging horse.
[09:39] <03@Ferrinus> 12The small army swarming down on Ir is made of shambling, discolored creatures who range from maroon to green to slate grey. They've got noseless faces, huge maws full of snaggly teeth, and long, apelike arms that are as likely to be wielding crude clubs and shortspears as they are to simply be flexing razor claws.
[09:39] <03Crion> 4Ir rolls her shoulders and cracks her neck as they bear down on her.
[09:40] <03dammitwho> 7Time to see how much of a bond she and the emas have managed in their short time together. She pushes herself up, for a split second standing upright on the bird's back, then backflips off to land neatly next to Ir. "Go, Ami!"
[09:41] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No chance you can call a friend in on this one, huh?"
[09:41] <03Crion> "We could use some quality girl time."
[09:41] <03Crion> "You know. Beating the shit out of the Wyld."
[09:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then at the salt-and-sulfur circle, with the bonfire in the center, Ying'll recognize what Eikichi is shuffling up. fthp-fthp-fthp-fthp "WHEREAS,"
[09:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They're on the southern cliff face of the mountain Ir docked the Heavensward against, looking out over the open field Blossom and Ir rode out on, the bonfire visible for miles around. Sondok watches the ritual silently, her back turned to the night with its signs and stars. The wind whips the flames higher, and Eikichi's hair and robes billow around him, but set flat against the 
[09:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10stone as he kneels at the rim of the circle, the cards don't move an inch as he sets them down. "-I invoke the entreaty of soul on soul, bargained for prizes material, of treasure won fair by blood..."
[09:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He sets the first card up - The Malfean Arcana, a city of sin and glory everlasting. "...but I do not concede."
[09:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ami and Errant go bolting off behind Ir and Blossom as the two women square off against the onrushing fae. They can't see the faces of either of the mounted champions, but, somehow, they can feel the vicious grins behind the visors.
[09:53] <03Crion> 4That just makes Ir's meaner.
[09:54] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying flips a page with a bunch of suggestions for hobbies for Tatsuya over and continues onto the next. She wants to make some clothes, but... there's a mental block there? So it's up to Tatsuya to figure something out, so that she can do that. After all, they have to work together! She shifts slightly from rock she's sat upon to look up with interest at Eikichi's spell. "Are all rituals like this?" 13Ying asks innocently.
[09:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12When Blossom lets loose and her flames connect, she somehow feels a familiar... clash, or tension, or dialectic. These are creatures of darkness, somehow, as fell and antagonistic to the earth beneath her feet as might be rampant demons or the unquiet dead!
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's shuffling again. The card holds fast to the cliffside like it's been pinned. "WHEREAS, I come forward as the last and the first, at the precipice of certainty and mystery, to trod their bordermarches plain and staved..." 10The next card hits the cliff, the Fool's Arcanum, with its high and hanging zero overlooking the blithe young man or woman questing into madness. 
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10"...but I do not concede."
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He doesn't look up at Ying. "Every ritual is different. Every ritual is the same."
[10:02] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom smiles grimly and conjures a sphere of flame between her hands, hurling it at the fae knight that is just slightly out of position! The apparent perfection of its gleaming silver armor and proud lances meets the actual perfection of a daughter of the Sun... and is! found! wanting! Not only does the flame batter and sear the creature, but soot darkens and heat crumples its 
[10:02] <03dammitwho> 7formerly glimmering breastplate!
[10:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12The thing snarls and shrieks in pain, clearly in inhuman, and spirals sideways through the air as it tries to right itself and its mount despite the wounds. Plumes of acrid smoke rise from the crater in its chest.
[10:06] <03trenchfoot> 13She keeps writing. "Cryptic! Next question. How do you know what card is going to come up?" 13There's a sketch of an outfit Ying wants; anything to keep from having to wear the maid outfit around town. It's fine on the ship, for now, but she really needs to give it back.
[10:17] <03Crion> 4The other asshole comes screeching out of the sky on his bug with a lance of his own. He's heading for Blossom. Ir's not about to let that happen. She smashes his attack aside with her own lance, then turns the haft of the weapon sideways and drives it into his(?) throat as he passes.
[10:22] <03Crion> 4That's when the goblins move in.
[10:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12They're everywhere, a whirling nightmare of claws and fangs and rough flint axes! But they hesitated in confusion for just a moment upon realizing that their prey wasn't running any longer.
[10:23] <03Crion> 4But she's got their number, too. Ir's a blur, dashing around the battlefield faster than the eye can parse, the only evidence of her passing the perfect clinks and clanks as every single of one of their blades is turned effortlessly aside.
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi might be so engrossed in his work that he doesn't notice the plume of dawnfire shooting into the sky some distance to the southeast, nor the spectral, faceless spearwoman that wars within it.
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ying certainly does, though, and even if not she'll be the first to hear the thunder of hooves and the kweh-ing of Ami.
[10:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I know what card has to come up. Past that the Road provides." 10fthp-fthp-fthp "WHEREAS, the signed resolve to adhere in all respects to regulations, laws, prvoisos, and dicta cirumscribing the agreement and all who submit to it..." 10The Empress Arcanum - the seat of pure reason and power - sticks to the stone. "...but I do not concede."
[10:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Within a few more moments, the two mounts have come bolting back into the Heavensward's shadow, a pair of seemingly ordinary humans holding onto them for dear life. It's a man and a woman, both at least in their middle age. They're dressed in a combination of furs and what might be sackcloth and look sickly and malnourished.
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi keeps going into the ritual, laying out elaborate clauses that Ying might not be paying attention to at this point. He doesn't notice the noise or the light, but Sondok does, and Sondok's coming down the mountain to meet the mounts. No sign of Ir or Blossom?
[10:35] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying hurries after Sondok to check on the mounts and their passengers. "Hey! Are you okay?"
[10:39] <03@Ferrinus> 12Man: "We... they... they're right... right beh..." 12He wheezes, unable to say much more, even though it was Errant rather than him that actually did all the sprinting just now. "Monsters!" 12the woman chimes in. "Fairies! Goblins! From the sky!"
[10:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok, to Ying: "Can you tend to them? The others may be in danger."
[10:42] <03Crion> 4At that precise moment in time, Ir is standing atop one of the fairy's bug mounts, driving Iscariot through its throat.
[10:42] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I don't think they're following you - they must be fighting Ir and Blossom. Are you hurt?" 13Is there blood anywhere? Obviously broken bones? To Sondok, she nods. "Leave it to me! Stay safe!"
[10:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12In fact, there is. The back of the woman's shirt is soaked through with blood, and the man grunts and nearly collapses after getting off the horse, clearly unable to stand.
[10:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Two red eyes burn in the night behind Blossom, the only definition in an ink-black silhouette. As the darkness bleeds upward from the silhouette's feet, green-burning plates clamp down on every part exposed. After a moment the only darkness that remains is the wild umbra of Sondok's hair and a jet-black bird's claw across her throat.
[10:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ying doesn't get to work quite yet, because she needs to figure out what work there is to do first. Shallow lacerations on the woman's back, what looks like an arrow shot through the man's ankle but then broken off, an assortment of scrapes and bruises from falls and impacts and other aspects of a rough and hasty retreat... these two will be in a bad way if they're not quickly bound 
[10:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12up and stabilized, and then there'll be infection to worry about.
[10:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Also, the ears of the man and woman both are a bit pointier and smoother than they should be given their age and the condition of the rest of their skin. That's not hereditary - could be the beginnings of wyld mutation.
[10:54] <03trenchfoot> 13There'll be supplies on board the Heavensward she can use for them. Bandages, clean water, medical tools, some towels... She'll have to consult with Eikichi or Blossom about the wyld mutation, but Ying can get to work stabilizing these two.
[10:54] <03Crion> 4Ir, dropping off the bug mount into the dust, grinning up at the fairy: "Heh. Now you fucked up."
[10:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Sondok finds Ir nominally embattled, although really it's the faerie that's getting roasted. It's clearly been stabbed straight through the stomach, to the point of having direlance-sized holes on both the front and back of its armor, but it's still going, driven to fight back by some combination of inhuman power and pure spite. The creature doesn't bleed properly - what looks like 
[10:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12darkness, flecked with stars and multicolored bubbles, is kind of oozing upwards out of the wound and dissipating into the air around it.
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She steps past Blossom, grabbing one of the dragonfly's legs to give herself leverage as she leaps up to decapitate the cataphract and come crashing back to earth with a second stroke that scatters goblins like pins. She roars at the remaining raksha.
[11:00] <03Crion> 4The head lands at Ir's feet. She kicks it at a nearby goblin, walloping him in the skull. To Sondok: "Glad you could make it."
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I was getting bored."
[11:01] <03Crion> "Well. Faeries will cure you of that."
[11:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And all it will cost them is their lives."
[11:03] <03Crion> 4Ir steadys her weapon in front of her. "Eh. They weren't using them anyway."
[11:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ying works quickly and efficiency, and that's a good thing since such things as gauze and bandages are also on the 'to resupply' list. Before long the two civilians or hunters or whomever they are have been stabilized. The man nods off to sleep, while the woman spends a lot of time thanking Ying profusely and also asking her who she is.
[11:04] <03Crion> 4Her eyes dart back to Blossom, then to Sondok again. "So anyone who wants to hit her goes through us, yeah?"
[11:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's one way to put it. I'd rather say that anyone who wants to hit her dies."
[11:04] <03trenchfoot> 13She sets to work as though she's done this a thousand times before. She starts with the man - she'll want to dig out that arrow first, and ensure that his ankle wound is cleaned and dressed before she moves on to his lesser wounds. Even though they might not look like much, when it comes to medicine it's always better to be safe than sorry!
[11:04] <03trenchfoot> 13Once he's been attended to, she patches up the woman as well. The lacerations on her back give Ying pause, but soon enough she's got them bandaged up, any bleeding stopped and the wounds ready to begin the healing process. Finally, Ying has time to talk to them - she spent the entire medical procedure explaining what she was doing to them and why, calming any fears that may arise.
[11:04] <03Crion> "I like your style."
[11:05] <03trenchfoot> "So! I'm Sunlit-Dreaming Ying. Who are you guys?"
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12The woman, still awake: "I'm Freda. This is my husband. We're... we were just foraging, before they came."
[11:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nobody's there to see Eikichi ante the entire deck to Gatamello. Nobody's there to see each card shrivel and char one by one as if cindered by a flame invisible. No one's there to hear the bargain he lays out.
[11:09] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Do you live around here, or...?"
[11:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "...since recently, yeah. It was move up here or the mines."
[11:18] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Ah! We're just passing through, my friends and I. We don't know the area that well - what mines?"
[11:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom raises both arms above her head. "SUN PURITY ESCALATION! KIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIII--" 7The towering pillar of light that marks Blossom's anima, with five dragons of pure solar light climbing ever towards the heavens, shines brighter for a moment... then collapses! From the growing, flickering sphere of energy that appears above Blossom's hands, the 
[11:22] <03dammitwho> 7five dragons roar out, chasing down the fleeing cataphract and striking it with the Sun's fury at all unholiness!
[11:24] <03Crion> 4Hahaha. Praise the fuckin' Sun.
[11:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "We come from the coast... other side of the Hedgehog range. A fishing village."
[11:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "But there's feathersteel up in the peaks. Apparently. 's why the whole area became a, whatsit. Satrapy."
[11:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom's assault is devastating - but these things are as tough as exalts, or nearly so. Though the back of rider and dragonfly both are black and burning, the faerie knight manages to bark one more set of untranslateable orders to the remaining goblins before shrugging a shoulder hard, wheeling its mount around, and beginning an escape back into the night sky.
[11:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hobgoblins bounce off Sondok's shield like hailstones.
[11:30] <03Crion> 4Ir redirects them with the tip of her spear, expertly puncturing them aside.
[11:36] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Sounds complicated. Are fae attacks a frequent problem here?"
[11:41] <03Crion> 4The last fairy knight is running, and there's not much they can do about it without Errant and Ami.
[11:41] <03Crion> 4Are these little idiots going to rout as well?
[11:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12The hobgoblins don't seem to survive their master's abandonment. The farther the dragonfly gets, the more vague and insubstantial your feral foes become, until it's just rats and voles and fireflies that are swirling around you fearsomely before scattering into the night.
[11:43] <03Crion> 4Lil fuckers.
[11:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12With Ir's and Blossom's animas both discharged into supernatural offensive power, the three insanely lethal women find themselves lit largely by the light of the moon and stars. It'll be a walk of perhaps half an hour to get back to the Heavensward, one that'll end a little past the sroke of midnight.
[11:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Ying's already being appraised of the situation. Freda: "Yes...  yes, for a long while. The further inland you go and the higher you climb... they come from above, you see. Take people away."
[11:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "But more of us have had to."
[11:46] <03Crion> 4Nice. Ir will keep an eye out for any cool fermentables on the way back, but they were pretty good at getting what they could out of the landscape already.
[11:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Well! That was fun."
[11:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom will make sure they're on track by the occasional leap to the treetops.
[11:47] <03Crion> "Damn straight it was."
[11:47] <03Crion> "Though now we've got complications."
[11:48] <03Crion> 4Ir grimaces. "Hopefully we won't need to stick around, but..."
[11:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's a bonfire on the cliff. Sondok points up to it. "His ritual will have just ended." 10She squints. "But the demon's already gone."
[11:49] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Is that good or bad?"
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "It means we don't have to talk to Gatamello."
[11:50] <03Crion> 4She's already tromping up the ramp, loosening the ties on her jacket and heading back to her cabin to freshen up. "Well, I'll just assume that's good."
[11:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi comes down to the Heavensward to check on the townsfolk. They see the radiantly beautiful young man with a weird green bug staff and piercing luminous eyes. "Hello. I see you're being... taken... care of..." 10He squints. What's their problem?
[11:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda audibly gasps, and her husband, who's beginning to wake back up, squints blearily at Eikichi as though at the rising sun.
[11:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Who is Gatamello?"
[11:54] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Ah! Eikichi! This is Freda and her husband. Freda, this is my friend Eikichi!"
[11:54] <03Crion> 4Ir, passing in the hall: "Yo, Ei. Fairies out and about. Fucked them up, but one got away. Stay sharp."
[11:54] <03Crion> 4She sticks her head in. "Hey there, you two. Said I'd seeya shortly."
[11:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Elfshot?! Shit."
[11:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elfshot? Could Eikichi mean the faintly silvery arrowhead Ying removed from the man's ankle and dropped into a sterile can or bowl or something? It does kind of shimmer sickly, when you look at it - like a film of oil over water.
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't turn around. "Blossom and Sondok make it back?"
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok, to Blossom: "Gatamello is the Barrister-General of Hell. Technically my peer."
[11:57] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yup. I'm gonna take a bath."
[11:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir gets her own gasp, though the one directed at hers is better-reasoned. "You... you're alive? You saved us!"
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ir does that."
[11:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "Wern, Wern- they made it! Wern, wake up-"
[11:58] <03Crion> "Damn right we did. Killed one of those bastards too, and sent the other one running."
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Two raksha?"
[11:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda: "How on... you don't look like monks."
[11:58] <03Crion> "Yep. Had some goblins they whipped up too."
[11:58] <03trenchfoot> 13Maybe! This is why she needed Eikichi to take a look. Mundane medical treatment is no problem, but magical illnesses can be a bit sketchy. "Ah, Eikichi, check the arrowhead - it was in his ankle. The wound's clean, but...?"
[11:58] <03Crion> "Silver knights, riding giant moths. Blossom can give you the full scoop."
[11:59] <03Crion> 4To the mortals: "We ain't monks."
[11:59] <03Crion> 4She'll leave Eikichi and Ying to figure out if and how to tell them what they actually are, though.
[11:59] <03Crion> 4She'll return in 20 minutes with a change of clothes and slightly frizzy, still-damp hair.
[12:00] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom pokes her head into the makeshift sickbay. "The civilians alright?"
[12:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Cataphractoi! That means there's a full raksha court around... Freda, Freda's husband, how much do you care about looking a little elfy?"
[12:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Only the first word of that was emphasized.
[12:02] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying nods to Blossom. "They will be by tomorrow." 13Hmm. Maybe she should've grabbed that outfit Eikichi had hidden.
[12:02] <03trenchfoot> 13The other one, I mean.
[12:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda's just as surprised to see Blossom - maybe she assumed that Ir benefited from Blossom's dramatic sacrifice. By this time, Wern's fully awake, and he's started to look around at the lot of you, eyes shifty and sweat beading on his forehead.
[12:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wern: "Freda...! Freda. You're... we're... hmm. Mrrm. Who'd these people say they are?"
[12:03] <03dammitwho> 7To Eikichi: "We only got one of the cataphractoi. The other one was wounded pretty badly but managed to fly off."
[12:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I can totally scrub the Wyld from your bodies if you'd like. It'll take me a few hours to do it safely, though. What do you say?"
[12:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10At Wern's question: "Sorry, my name's Eikichi. Just a sorcerer passing through."
[12:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda considers this, but Wern speaks first. "Ch-change us, will you? Make us look... how you want? No, no, no thanks."
[12:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "You've got the wrong idea!"
[12:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda blinks. "What my husband's-" 12she suddenly seems to realize something, and swallows hard. "We should just, we should just, we've imposed on you already-"
[12:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'd just be purging the Wyld mutations and protecting you from further ones. You'd look like you lived further from a Middlemarch."
[12:09] <03Crion> 4When Ir returns, she's grousing, specifically to Blossom. "I'm glad I found us that natural mountain hotspring, but I'm getting tired of getting naked outside."
[12:09] <03Crion> "We need to get a heating crucible or something in here."
[12:10] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "We're not fae. I promise. Wait, does that help or hurt? I think fae have to keep promises...?" 13She looks vaguely lost. "Um. We're just passing travelers who want to help you. I apologize for making you nervous."
[12:10] <03dammitwho> "Decadence! Luxury!" 7She's smiling, though. "I'll see what I can do."
[12:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda blinks at Ying. "...you promise? Then, then. All of you. All of you swear you're human."
[12:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi just radiates beatific calm on them. "Hey. Hey. Nobody's trying to change you. We just want to help. You just want what anybody would want when they're scared. And that's what I can offer you: the chance to get some normality back."
[12:11] <03Crion> "Babe, I spent the last 20 months living on horseback in the Far North. I am ready for decadence and luxury."
[12:11] <03Crion> 4Ir, to Freda, mildly annoyed: "It would impossible for me to be what I am were I not human."
[12:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wern: "Woman, you want them to just kill us?! Please, l-lords an' ladies, just..." 12He peers at the sorcerer as he realizes what Eikichi's saying.
[12:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi holds his hands up. "Nothing happens to you that you don't want. Say the word and we'll let you recuperate in silence and go home."
[12:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...but that's not what you want, is it?"
[12:13] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "We might have some iron around here too, if it would make you feel better."
[12:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We've definitely got some iron around here. Half the damn pots and pans are iron."
[12:14] <03Crion> "I'll go get a skillet."
[12:15] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "That's right! Thank you, Ir!"
[12:16] <03Crion> 4She'll return with a cast iron skillet they've been using for steaks.
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "If she were raksha she wouldn't be able to hold that without her hand going numb and frostbitten."
[12:17] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I mean hell. I could wear it as a hat."
[12:17] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Please don't, we cook with that."
[12:17] <03Crion> "I'm cooking us all dinner on it, though, so I won't."
[12:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12They look back and forth. The woman already looks relieved, but the man's intent. "Gotta swear. All of you, I said."
[12:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi to Blossom: "Did you see which direction it flew off in?"
[12:18] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Lot of boar from today's haul. Y'all want some ham?"
[12:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom rolls her eyes. "Yes, we're all humans. I swear upon Mount Meru."
[12:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I am human. I swear upon the breaking of the Nail."
[12:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi rolls his eyes. "We're Anathema."
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We are still human, just as the Princes of the Earth are still human."
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But we're Anathema."
[12:20] <03Crion> 4Ir, to Eikichi: "You're really not very good at this when you don't want to be."
[12:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12The last remaining rider flew off northwest, incidentally, up over the cluster of mountains that these hunters seemed to be referring to as the Hedgehog range.
[12:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12The two mortals blanche. Eventually, Wern manages a weak: "...y'swear...?"
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "On our burning names."
[12:21] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Golly, well, I wasn't going to say anything. Yes."
[12:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wern: "Well... well if it don't hurt... and it'll make us look normal, y'said..."
[12:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Freda nods.
[12:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Right! First thing's first." 10He lays hands on the wound.
[12:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'll just assume y'all want some ham. Ying, you want to help me out or are you good here?"
[12:23] <03trenchfoot> 13She nods. "Can do!"
[12:23] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "She makes good ham."
[12:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I want to be safe about this, so one of you's going to need to sit tight for a couple of hours."
[12:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10If neither of them volunteers, Eikichi'll eeny meeny miny moe 'em.
[12:24] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Sounds good. Will take awhile to get this all worked out anyway. If you're hungry right now, though, I can start you off with some midnight eggs."
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12At this point, Eikichi has the cooperation of the two hunters. Should we fast forward a few hours to an inexplicable post-midnight dinner, or next morning, or...?
[12:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> sounds fine to me
[12:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sounds fine to me.
[12:26] <03Crion> 4The meal is extremely fantastic, but we can summarize it.
[12:26] <03dammitwho> 7Egg's
[12:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12So, at some point your two guests are really going to need to sleep, but their fear of the supernatural doesn't last long in the face of the tantalizing smell of Ir's cooking and they'll end up joining you for breakfast or whatever.
[12:27] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying slips away after the meal and heads off to meditate. She leaves the notepad on Tatsuya's dresser.
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Idle conversation between them, and them and you, is enough to reveal that A) faeries have been striking from the sky for basically forever, particularly around the Hedgehog mountains, and B) more and more people are being forced to live in that area and contend with the fae because the coast to the west which once hosted a number of fishing villages and farming ranges has been taken 
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12over by the Realm.
[12:29] <03Crion> 4The first course is Midnight Eggs. You scramble four eggs for every guest with diced peppercheese, a splash of milk, and copious ground pepper, lightly salt to taste, and serve. That's fine. Then they get to sleep, while Ir fires up the oven to precook some of the boar meet while outside, she sets up a firepit and a spit. This is an old technique: Pneuman Ham, In-and-Out Style. You 
[12:29] <03Crion> 4start it in the oven, heavily rubbed and spiced, take it out to the firepit for most of the cooking, then return it to the oven for the end.
[12:29] <03Crion> 4By the time you're done you've got a perfect animal for carving, and their patients will wake up to an expansive brunch.
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Are people being shoved into the mines? What's the local satrap like? How bad are the taxes?
[12:32] <03trenchfoot> 6In the morning, Tatsuya takes a brief glance through the notepad Ying left him - he remembers all of it, but it's still good to get an... outside view on it? A different inside view on it? This is going to give him a headache. After some brief stretches and a few practice strikes to recall his martial arts, he joins the group at brunch.
[12:32] <03Crion> 4Combine that with a formidable brush salad, some more eggs -- Two-Eyed Style, this time -- and some hashed and browned potatoes, and you've got yourself a hell of a meal.
[12:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi picks at it like a bird but is very complimentary.
[12:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wern and Freda discuss the way that local fishing and farming became rapidly less profitable when put into competition with Realm imports and even with 'local' Realm operations performed with the aid of Dragon-Blooded puissance, such that more and more of the locals found themselves choosing service or mining jobs just to be able to stay afloat. Plus, the Realm's there to curtail 
[12:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12the expanse of the fae - the local Wyld Hunt's an extremely literal one, and needs a lot of support from the locals to continue operating at peak efficiency, supposedly.
[12:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12So the upshot is that a lot of people are starving until they help to dig and drag ore, and the satrap runs the place with military exactitude, and the taxes are just going up and up with the increased needs of the Realm and the ever-bolder fae and so on. It's a hard life, and it produces a lot of refugees like these two.
[12:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi, to Ir and Blossom: "How hard did you shine last night? Should we be expecting exploratory parties from the local Hunt?"
[12:36] <03dammitwho> "It's likely."
[12:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12And it's a hard life, up here in the mountains - the fae'll swoop down to abduct you outright or pose strange challenges to you or demand choices that don't make sense. More people vanish by the month, and when they come back they're pretty and weird.
[12:37] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yup."
[12:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya eats quickly and greedily, like he's making up for lost time somehow. Still, he doesn't act as though anything is amiss. "Sondok saw them from the ship. Can't imagine she was the only one."
[12:37] <03Crion> 4Ir, to Tatsuya: "Hey there, sunshine. Nice to see you again."
[12:37] <03Crion> "Not that Ying's not cool."
[12:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It was a long night. You remember everything?"
[12:38] <03Crion> 4Ir could use a trip to market, honestly. She's burned through quite a bit of their egg reserve in her exuberance.
[12:38] <03Crion> 4You know what she should do, is make some bread. She'll need flour for that, though...
[12:39] <03Crion> 4Father a brewer, mother a chef. Both Citywatch. Odd, maybe, that she went so hard into performing, but she learned their lessons.
[12:39] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "It's good to be back." 6To Eikichi: "I think so. There's no gaps, at least. Seems like it was a success."
[12:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Good. You feeling okay?"
[12:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, if you need supplies, you can always hit the markets to the west...!
[12:41] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Never better." 6He grins, light and easy. "Well, okay, maybe not NEVER better. But I feel pretty good."
[12:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Alright..."
[12:42] <03trenchfoot> "Is something the matter?"
[12:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12If the Solars have questions about the local situation - the area's history, the nature of the fae, the nature of the Realm occupation on the coast - they're free to ask or otherwise investigate.
[12:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's bored now. He'll go off and work on other stuff and let the others interrogate the refugees.
[12:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He doesn't ignore Tatsuya's question but he doesn't really answer it either.
[12:47] <03Crion> 4Those don't really sound like questions Ir is interested in. She is, however, interested in whether she can barter for some more eggs, sugar, and other essentials to replenish the cooking stores that don't involve raw meat.
[12:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12There are a number of refugee communities in and around the hedgehog mountains which are doing their best, but it's really hard to sustain yourself when you haven't got both a coastline and a lot of open fields to work off of. Eggs Ir will definitely be able to barter for if she approaches the right settlements, but good freaking luck with grains of basically any kind.
[12:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12In the satrapy itself there's a thriving market for all sorts of goods, both finished food and raw cooking materials certainly included, but that would mean marching right into what's like 40% a Cathak military base and hoping they'll take your coin. And they might! If they don't recognize you.
[12:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12There are also rumors that the fae have their own grand market, up in the sky.
[12:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A Cathak military base?
[12:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12Oh yeah, this is a House Cathak joint, apparently.
[12:55] <03Crion> 4Pfah! Bread is poison. Eggs, dairy, spices, salt. That's what they need right now.
[12:56] <03Crion> 4She'll find flour elsewhere.
[12:58] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom grunts as she eats. "There's something up with the beachhead. Going for all the feathersteel they can get makes sense, but they shouldn't need to fortify that much unless there's something deeper going on."
[12:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, eggs and probably salt can probably be traded for with the people living in and around these mountains, but if you want real spices or a proper selection of herbs and other greens you'll need a better selection. In terms of pure survival, though, you can definitely get along on simple hunting, foraging, and water condensation indefinitely.
[12:59] <03Crion> 4Ah well. Simple living is hearty living.
[13:00] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "We could investigate. Although we've already drawn their attention... might be difficult to do quietly."
[13:02] <03Crion> 4Ir shrugs. "I'm fine with being loud."
[13:02] <03Crion> "Not like we haven't been tracked all the damn way down here."
[13:06] <03trenchfoot> 6He shrugs. "True. I'd still prefer quiet, but I suppose that's a luxury at this point."
[13:07] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We probably haven't, actually. There's been enough cloud cover and enough empty tundra that the best the global Wyld Hunt is likely to have is 'somewhere south of Crystal'."
[13:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12So - that's the situation the squared circle finds itself in. Cathak to the west, the fae to the... up? ... and feathersteel beneath their feet. We'll learn what response this demands from our heroes, if any... next week.
[13:08] <03Crion> 4Ir shrugs again. "If that elemental knew enough about us to figure our position, I'm not enthusiastic that, say, Yara's friends have lost track of us."
[13:14] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, helping clean up after breakfast: "So why did you need a demon lawyer?"
[13:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Huh? Oh. I need a publicist."
[13:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, needed. We've got one now."
[13:17] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "What's he publishing?"
[13:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Things I write. Propaganda. If-and-when you start recollecting or writing new holy texts, those too."
[13:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm working on a dramatic serial novelization of our adventures! 14amongotherprojects"
[13:20] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom gently dries her hands and clears her throat. "Let me seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
[13:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I guess I could show you the first chapter. It ends with us meeting Berg and Ir."
[13:20] <03Crion> 4Ir, of course, is at the big sink basin that drains out off the side of the ship, doing the damn dishes.
[13:20] <03Crion> 4She snort-laughs at that.
[13:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi'll make Blossom read it in his room though! He's shy,
[13:23] <03Crion> 4Whatever, dude. Ir will hear about it eventually.
[13:24] <03dammitwho> 7What perspective is it written from? How does Eikichi describe himself?
[13:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's written third-person, but it follows Tatsuya and Eikichi around, at least in the first chapter. Eikichi identifies himself here as 'The Golden Hand's eager advisor, called 'Shosei''. He's described alternately as 'boyish', 'meekly dressed', and 'deferent'.
[13:29] <03dammitwho> 7Same question, but for the other solars.
[13:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10You mean like 'the rakish and renowned gentleman thief Tatsuya, the Golden Hand' or 'the faithful man-mountain with an icewalker's bearing who calls himself 'Bergsveinn'' or 'the taciturn and mysterious rider - who speaks in liquid alto and gives her name as 'Ir' with all bluntness of an elbow to the ribs'?
[13:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's everyone, right?
[13:39] <03dammitwho> 7Not everyone.

[23:15] <03Quaker> It is, as far as any of them can recall, the hardest rain they’ve ever seen. It’s like someone has upturned a bottomless bucket onto the streets. 
[23:15] <03Crion> 4Even Clinton?
[23:16] <03Quaker> Sure. Wasn’t California supposed to be in a drought…?
[23:16] <03Crion> 4Damn.
[23:17] <03Quaker> Their invitations stand. 8:00 PM, give or take the usual delays. 
[23:18] <03Crion> 4Clinton, of course, owns his own tuxedo. Black tie formal, yes?
[23:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How's our time?" 10croaks the voice from the backseat of the big Continental.
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll make it even if there's an accident." 10Cora's from Seattle, but despite that she can drive perfectly well in the rain.
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What if there's two?" 10Nora doesn't look up from her phone.
[23:21] <03Quaker> Don’t show up without a tuxedo. Actually - you could, but you’d have to get past the ushers and security checking everyone at the door. 
[23:22] <03Crion> 4Not a problem for Clinton Cavanaugh. When he pulls up -- is there car service?
[23:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The women don't have to wear tuxes, right? This isn't some mass remake of that Eurythmics video?
01[23:23] <03banana> 6K. J. Valentine wakes angry, which is not normal. 
[23:23] <03Quaker> There is, and they don’t. 
01[23:24] <03banana> 6She opens her eyes in tune with the sunset, that's fine - sits up as fresh as the day she died, looks in the mirror, can't see anything but she knows she's looking good. None of that is the problem.
[23:25] <03Crion> 4Then Clinton steps out of his Lexus and hands the attendant his keys looking crisp, fresh, and alive -- sharp angles and rosy cheeks.
01[23:25] <03banana> 6Normally she'd catch a show or two before grabbing a ride to the ballet; tonight she's got to do a bit of research instead, look into the latest smartphone vulnerabilities and review this brochure from Crook & Cross International. All of that is also OK. 
[23:25] <03Crion> 4Laguna Beach has an excellent dry cleaner's just down the street from his and Kayleigh's townhouse.
[23:25] <03Crion> 4...He didn't come from there, though.
01[23:26] <03banana> 6What has the Lord of Anaheim upset, muttering herself into a strapless dress and deciding she'd better Uber instead of drive because she'd just start yelling at the other people on the road - it's the circumstances.
[23:26] <03Crion> 4No, he came from the mansion -- the official estate of Baron Laguna -- where he is considering, in a strange move for both a Gangrel and a finance bro, putting in a library.
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then when Cora hands the car off to the valet, a pinched little man in a neat tuxedo gets waved in, flanked by two slightly taller women with curly dark hair and round faces. It gives the impression of a father out with his daughters, or some rich old asshole with A Type. Bystanders' looks just go right through him; Wilson Frost believes so strongly that he doesn't care what anyone 
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10thinks of him that sometimes it's even true.
01[23:28] <03banana> 6She's not going to do her best work under this kind of pressure. Being kicked upstairs is one thing, but the threats? Unnecessary. This is how you give an ally a grudge. What was Murray thinking? Is it a culture fit thing?
[23:28] <03tom> 14The uber is late. He fumbles the directions, they drive in circles a bit. He gives the guy a five-star review out of sympathy. Tommy steps onto the curb in an ill-fighting suit and gets the door for Clarabelle.
[23:28] <03tom> 14He pats himself down for any stray tags he might've missed.
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's got the kind of features that make a young man look old; the skin and eyes and mouth of an older man, a hairline that'd have been gone entirely if he'd lived to 30. But he still looks so much younger than he is.
01[23:29] <03banana> 6And now it's fucking raining.
[23:30] <03Quaker> Presbyter Vincent steps onto the curb, in her flowing, dark blue evening gown. It’s the first time he’s ever seen her outside her usual clerical blacks. “Thank you, Deacon. Are you feeling alright?” 
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ arrives at the venue well ahead of time, but alone apart from an umbrella. She's in no mood to take in a performance.
[23:31] <03Crion> 4Clinton Cavanaugh is among the first ones to arrive. He's been dreading this night, but with a certain degree of impatience. Anticipation, even. Dread? No, not really. He doesn't think Bren will show his face at a ballet, and even if Burne does...well. They're both adults.
[23:31] <03Crion> 4He will definitely accept an usher taking him to...wherever they're all being gathered, and keep an eye out for Leisurely.
[23:32] <03Crion> 4But it's sixty-forty odds she's not even going to show.
[23:32] <03Crion> 4That's what his gut says, at least.
[23:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You two going to be alright in the cheap seats?" 10Baron Hollywood asks his retainers.
[23:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll miss the company," 10says Cora, the junior of the two. She both is and looks a little younger than her counterpart, wearing a shimmering navy dress that she got on clearance last summer and hasn't had a chance to wear yet.
[23:35] <03tom> "N-yeah." 14He's stuffing his tie into the front of his suit. "Nervous energy."
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You going to be alright in the box?" 10says Nora, who managed to carry a phone, a purse, a tablet, and the first laugh-lines of middle age into this opera house and its lend-lease immortality.
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Don't worry about me," 10says Wilson. "I live for these parties."
[23:36] <03Quaker> Clarabelle straightens his tie. “Don’t worry. It’s just a performance.” 
[23:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Frost waves the ladies off. "Go on, mingle. Enjoy yourselves. Text me if you find a bomb."
[23:37] <03Crion> 4In his mind, Baron Laguna is going over his responsibilities. He's fed Shots and Honey, checked in with Rush and Buchanon; they'll all keep for the rest of the night. Kayleigh knows not to expect to see him until they have a late dinner tomorrow night -- breakfast for him, really, but even when he was alive he liked eating breakfast food at the end of the day and pizza at the beginning, 
[23:37] <03Crion> 4so unlife has treated him fairly well on that.
01[23:37] <03banana> 6KJ waves herself past a doorperson in what isn't quite a snap. ..Of course she exudes a radiant aura of supernatural fascination, so it's easy to forgive that sort of thing. The young woman in gray is at the height of fashion, has a kind of exotic beauty which is only heightened by the sparkle to her eyes, et fucking cetera.
[23:38] <03Quaker> Leisurely is waiting in the large antechamber they’ve been ushered into. Her cornflower yellow hair has been combed and brushed and set up with pins and blue ribbons. She’s wearing a far nicer dress than Cav knew she possessed. It’s the first time he’s ever seen her with eyeliner, foundation, and lipstick. 
[23:38] <03tom> 14Deacon Saldana exhales, nods. "Hoo yeah, okay." 14Say something nice about the dress, asshole! "Ready?"
[23:38] <03Crion> 4When he left Laguna, the flock was quiet...but he's started to feel antsy and unsettled whenever he spends too much time away from Laguna. He wonders how other Shepherds deal with that. It startled him, a few months back, to realize he'd never seen either Alicia or Peter actually keep a flock.
[23:38] <03Crion> 4...Well then.
[23:38] <03Quaker> “After you,” replies the Presbyter. 
[23:40] <03Crion> 4To Leisurely: "Visionary. You look fantastic." 4It's a compliment, but the detached, formal sort required of a man of high standing to a woman of high standing. They're in Invictus space, now.
[23:41] <03tom> 14He escorts Presbyter Vincent in out of the rain. 
[23:42] <03Quaker> “Thank you, Clinton.” The ushers have gone back out to fetch more people. “Of course, here it’s just Leisurely. Or Miss Foster. No titles necessary.” 
[23:43] <03Crion> 4Well. That goes against all his instincts. Titles are easier to remember for him than names, somehow. He won't be forgetting her's, however. "As you wish, Leisurely."
01[23:45] <03banana> 6Well, whatever. Get over it. Who's around? Anyone friendly, anyone KJ needs to politely entitle, anyone from what she thinks of as 'the cohort'..?
[23:45] <03Quaker> The ushers seem to tell who They are instinctively - instead of going with the rest of the crowd filing into the rows, a velvet rope is unclasped and taken away, and they’re led down the hallway beyond. The room they’re led into is large enough to hold 20, with benches and couches - and two doors lay beyond. Box 30 and 31. The later arrivals will see a handsome young man and a slightly older woman, the latter looking vaguely more 
[23:45] <03Quaker> uncomfortable than the former. 
[23:46] <03Quaker> Oh - hey - it’s Wilson!/Oh - hey - it’s KJ! 
[23:46] <03Quaker> They must have gotten the same invitation. 
[23:46] <03Quaker> Cav sees Presbyter Vincent arrive, flanked by a horrible looking man. 
[23:46] <03Crion> 4Cav won't sit. He finds himself restless in situations like these.
[23:47] <03Crion> 4He will, however, head over to greet Clarabelle.
[23:47] <03tom> "They got those little shramps here I wonder."
[23:47] <03Quaker> She looks tired, even in her finery. “Baron Laguna. You’re looking well.” 
[23:48] <03Crion> "Presbyter Vincent. You look stunning this evening." 4He'll greet her in whatever way is customary for the court this season. Hopefully it's not kissing the hand like they're in a damn Jane...Hou...like they're in Pride and Prejudice. New York's formality was so cloying.
[23:48] <03Crion> *You're
[23:48] <03Crion> -*You're
[23:50] <03Crion> 4He'll turn to Clarabelle's companion, Jesus Christ, right, he's used to Nosferatu and knows it would be rude to let anything show on his face -- and wait a brief moment to see if he'll be introduced.
01[23:50] <03banana> 6Of all the friendly faces to come across tonight.. well. Not a friendly face, but
[23:51] <03Quaker> “Baron, Deacon Thomas Saldana. A friend of Father Soria’s. A member of the new congregation next door to your land. Deacon, Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron Laguna.” 
01[23:52] <03banana> 6KJ moves across the room trailing suppressed emotions. "Wilson Frost, out on the town!" 
[23:52] <03Quaker> They do not have shramps, little or otherwise. 
[23:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anyway, once the girls are gone Wilson reaches into his pocket. They didn't want him to drink tonight but he bargained them down to 'show up sober'. No reason he has to leave that way. He's one of the first people up into the box waiting room - oh shit, look who it is. "Anaheim's never looked so good. How are you, Baron?"
01[23:52] <03banana> "Did you not bring a movie star date?"
[23:53] <03Quaker> If they’re not distracted by frustration or nervousness, they’ll all shortly realize that for whatever reason, their Beasts are being unnaturally suppressed. It makes the meeting and greeting much easier, without the feeling of fear and hatred flaring up in their minds every time they see someone new. 
[23:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I figured I'd just make one while I was here. How's business?"
[23:54] <03tom> "Cavanaugh," 14the Deacon shows some teeth with his smile, tries not to. "Nice. Real nice." 14Extends a hand. Shakes for what is either too short or far too long. "Lucky run-in. We gotta talk later- not here though, gotta keep business outta your social life, yeah."
[23:54] <03Crion> 4Ah. The church grows. Cav will offer a hand to shake. "Pleasure, Deacon. I look forward to working with you. I have an...understanding, with the Sanctum." 4He pauses. "With elements of the Sanctum. Given that I am steward of the highway into town from San Diego, I am perhaps a bit more perspicacious when it comes to visitors on my territory than others might be."
[23:55] <03Crion> 4He smiles, slightly squinting. "But we're all on the same team here, right?"
01[23:55] <03banana> 6KJ: "Actually really good. Turns out it's so easy to find people in the area around Disneyland? And running things properly is something you can delegate. No wonder we get titles."
01[23:56] <03banana> "Like, before the area was split up for Frances and I apparently they used to call it 'the Rack'. I asked what that meant and, well, fair enough."
[23:57] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And hell. Business is my social life."
[23:58] <03tom> 14And that's.... good. "Man, I hope so."
[23:59] <03Crion> 4The grin widens. "Good. Good. I have a feeling we'll get along just fine, Deacon." 4He lets the handshake go and turns to Clarabelle. "Enjoy your evening, Presbyter. Deacon."
[23:59] <03Crion> 4He'll head over to where he left Leisurely, unless she's wandered off.
[23:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's a good racket. You got Angel Stadium on your beat too, yeah? Baseball season's coming up. Excellent real estate."
Session Time: Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03tom> 14Tommy slicks back his hair and plucks his phone from his pocket and furtively googles 'perspicacious'. This takes a few tries.
01[00:00] <03banana> 6It takes KJ a moment to realise what's going on with what she likes to think of as her unwelcome visitor. (Replaced the monthly one, see). Ever since mastering* Obfuscate she hasn't had much of a problem around other vampires, but now they're not bothering her in return.. interesting. Notable. 
[00:01] <03Crion> 4Which is funny, because Cav got that word by googling for synonyms for 'discerning' earlier in the night.
[00:01] <03tom> 14He replaces it into his pocket. It's a social thing, after all. "Okay, if the rest are like that maybe this will be survivable."
01[00:01] <03banana> "I've got to admit.. the last time I saw a game was the Giants. On the way to win the World Series, but its not something people are excited by down here, for some reason."
[00:01] <03Quaker> The door to Box 30 opens slightly, and Rosa Isaacs, dressed in a tuxedo, steps out. 
[00:02] <03Crion> 4Damn.
[00:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Damn.
01[00:02] <03banana> 6-that's someone taking a phone out of their pocket. KJ is on alert.. no, the man's an obvious Nosferatu. Actually, though, there's a guy on the other side of the room who matches the description of Clinton Cavanaugh.
01[00:03] <03banana> 6Looks like kind of a bro. He's staring at Rosa, which completes the image. Windswept or 'windswept' hair? ..the dulled instinct they've somehow got going on in this place is messing with KJ, because now she's thinking: yeah, if this was a club and he was a mortal, he'd be on tonight's list.
[00:04] <03Quaker> She moves with the practiced ease of someone who has shaken ten thousand hands. “Thank you all so much for coming. The rest are in Box 30. Box 31 is open for anyone requiring more quiet. Please, if you need anything -“ she gestures to the half-dozen waiters who have appeared with napkins draped over arms. 
[00:04] <03Crion> 4Cav's definitely using product tonight.
[00:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What ballet is actually playing tonight, anyway?
[00:05] <03tom> 14He's whispering now, for all the good that does: "This is just gonna be normal ballet, right- there's not gonna be any murders or freaky shit that happens-"
[00:06] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “I’d hope so. We’re watching the same thing as a thousand other mortals.” 
01[00:06] <03banana> 6To Wilson: "I can live without quiet tonight. Actually, I haven't really.. looked up the programme or anything.."
03[00:06] * Joins: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net)
[00:07] <03tom> 14He's sweaty, somehow. Grabs a napkin from one of the help, mumbles thanks. Pat-down. "Yeah, ok."
[00:08] <03tom> 14Claps. "Can you help me with names? Gonna try and make a big effort here."
[00:08] <03tom> 14He gestures to the kindred in turn.
[00:08] <03Crion> 4Cav will follow Leisurely's lead here, assuming she hasn't slipped away, but he'd probably prefer the quiet room so he can just spend the night on his phone, both checking the local news site for Laguna (which he's surreptitiously financing through Buchanon as a gracious anonymous donor) and any number of local crime blogs/Twitter accounts.
[00:10] <03Quaker> “Of course.” Clarabelle surreptitiously points and names as they pass. 
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To KJ: "I looked at the program but all I remember is I don't think I've seen this one before."
[00:10] <03Quaker> Leisurely hasn’t slipped away. In fact, he can see her entering Box 30. 
[00:10] <03Crion> 4Ah well. Socializing it is.
[00:10] <03Quaker> If he follows, he’ll see her take a seat in the very rear corner of the box, away from the rest. 
02[00:11] * Quits: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:12] <03Quaker> As soon as they enter into the boxes far above the hall, it becomes harder to hear themselves over the murmur of the crowd below, and the amelodic droning of the orchestra tuning their instruments. 
01[00:12] <03banana> 6KJ: "Unless it's the Nutcracker, neither have I." 
01[00:12] <03banana> "OK, tell me something," 6she demands.
[00:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mm?"
01[00:13] <03banana> "Did the Invictus recruit solely from high society.. or solely from people who're happy to have an excuse to now be part of high society? There are perfectly nice people around here who call themselves, like, landowners. And we attend the theatre. "
[00:13] <03Crion> 4Cav takes a step towards her, then pauses. He's not her date. If she wants space, she's entitled to space. He'll find a seat closer to the action. He's never been to ballet before.
[00:14] <03tom> "Hell on your nerves, you know, being around all these movers-n-shakers. Some of 'em could just rip your head off like," 14he snaps his fingers. It's not like they can't hear him.
[00:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's an aesthetic. Some people take it seriously. Some people get weird with it. Most people at least play along."
[00:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's the social contract, Baron Valentine, and we got upsold but good."
[00:15] <03Crion> 4He will, however, on occasion glance back to check up on Leisurely. Real casual like.
[00:16] <03Crion> 4No Burne tonight, right?
[00:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hey, Wilson should say hi to Leisurely. "Hey, Foster. Surprised to see you schlep up here for this."
[00:16] <03Crion> 4Or that fuck Cosmo Morgan.
[00:16] <03tom> 14He glances back at Vincent approvingly. "Not you though, like your veins're ice water."
[00:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It doesn't look like KJ knows her, right? Wilson can introduce.
01[00:16] <03banana> "Baron Frost, I have no actual objections. Just an endless font of suprise at this, uh, millieu, like that it still exists.." 6who's this?
[00:17] <03Crion> 4He does take note of the little man and the...striking young woman visiting Leisurely, however. He doesn't know either of them.
[00:17] <03Crion> 4But, it would be rude to interrupt.
[00:17] <03Quaker> The rest: Cav recognizes Count Sherman Ma, from the other parties, checking his phone. A chair has been removed so that Guadalupe Ochoa’s wheelchair can fit into the aisle, and she’s leaning over the side, making whispering conversation with a younger woman dressed in greens, both of them occasionally laughing. There’s a handful of other Barons he might know by sight or reputation, too, but nobody else he’s closed to. And no Bren or 
[00:17] <03Quaker> Burne to be found. 
[00:18] <03Crion> 4Well. Small favors.
[00:18] <03Crion> 4At least he won't ruin the tux.
[00:18] <03Quaker> And in the middle, of the seats, letting the sound and activity move around them, sit Prince Bailey and the Countess-Palatine, holding hands as they watch the musicians prepare. 
[00:19] <03Quaker> Leisurely looks up in surprise. “Hello, Wilson. I didn’t expect to see you out.” 
[00:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Heh. You and me both. Have you met KJ Valentine? She got the good half of Anaheim. KJ, this is Leisurely Foster, an old friend."
[00:20] <03Quaker> Clarabelle accepts the compliment. “We just have to remember that we came here to do something besides watch the ballet, Deacon.” 
01[00:21] <03banana> 6There's one answer to KJ's question, right? The Prince of the Brilliant Court. He likes the ballet, and so we enjoy the ballet...
[00:21] <03Quaker> Leisurely extends her hand to shake delicately. It’s very warm. 
[00:21] <03Crion> 4Of course they are. These days Cav can't decide if he hates the Prince, envies him, or both.
01[00:21] <03banana> "Hey, Wilson's a charmer. I have the bad half, just downtown.. but it's got the chocolate shops." 
01[00:22] <03banana> 6KJ's hand is not warm.. until just after or partway through the handshake, because now she's been reminded. Damn, it is that kind of occasion, isn't it.
[00:22] <03tom> "Yeah, yeah. 'Course."
[00:24] <03Quaker> As Cav stares, the Prince leans over and whispers something in his wife’s ear. She laughs, and then leans over to kiss him on the cheek. 
[00:25] <03Crion> 4Cav is NOT staring.
[00:25] <03Crion> 4He swings back to watch the stage.
[00:25] <03Crion> 4...And considers texting Kayleigh to see what she's up to later.
[00:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10And then KJ and Leisurely are shaking hands alone.
[00:26] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I hope he was calling the friendship old. And not…you know…” 
[00:26] <03Crion> 4When Cav glances back at Leisurely next, he sees the striking young woman and Leisurely talking. He almost briefly wonders where the smaller man went, but the thought dies unformed. For whatever reason.
[00:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson walks out into the hall, drains another quarter of his flask, and sloughs off the cloak to walk into the quiet box.
[00:27] <03Quaker> Clarabelle takes her seat. “I’ll leave it up to you, Deacon. I don’t want to be seen leaning too heavily in either direction.” 
[00:27] <03tom> 14Tommy sits down, smoothes out his Tux, looks around. He pats the Presbyter's shoulder with the back of his hand. "Ohhhshit look at that, another member of the tribe. You don't mind if I leave you alone for a minute, do ya?"
[00:28] <03Quaker> Clarabelle shrugs. “Whatever you’d like.” 
01[00:28] <03banana> 6KJ raises her eyebrows at.. nobody. "Must've been but.. the heck. Um, you aren't some sort of secret contact here to pass me vital intel, are you? That's usually what happens when someone forces an introduction and dematerialises.."
[00:29] <03Quaker> There’s only one other person in Box 31. The lights inside are off. Silhouetted against the light below, her outline is dominated by her large hat. 
[00:29] <03tom> 14His wince turns into a cordial smile as he turns back to her. He nods and saunters on over to the nosferatu. "Hey, you look like shit, pal!"
[00:30] <03Quaker> The Baron he’s talking to stammers. “I - I THINK you have the wrong person, sir-!” 
01[00:31] <03banana> KJ: "It's totally okay if you aren't. I guess he can be a bit.. private?"
[00:31] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Why would I pass you information? Are you in that business/“ 
[00:31] <03Quaker> Are you in that business?” 
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's presence materializes again before he sits down. Hopefully he doesn't end up sitting on some other poor Obfuscated schmoe. "Evening, Blythe," 10he mutters as he sits two seats down from her.
[00:32] <03tom> 14Tommy returns to his seat a minute later, face red. He reaches into his pocket and produces a cigarette, which he chews on, unlit.
[00:32] <03Quaker> The tuning of the orchestra dies out. A hush falls over the crowd. 
01[00:32] <03banana> 6KJ: "Not anymore! Hence Anaheim. Just the first thing that came to mind to cover crippling social awkwardness, you know?"
01[00:32] <03banana> 6Oh, it's starting..
[00:33] <03Quaker> Countess Lancaster turns to look at him. Now that she’s got company, she takes her hat off and places it gently on the seat next to her. “Good evening, Baron. I didn’t know you liked the ballet.” 
[00:34] <03Crion> 4Cav will pocket his phone after turning it off here.
[00:35] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “What do you mean by ‘not anymore’?” 
01[00:36] <03banana> 6Ah, there- he's putting away a phone.. KJ's got extremely good night vision, these days. She even notes the model number on the back. Stepping can matter.
[00:37] <03Crion> 4He's actually turning to put the phone in his pocket and look back at Leisurely when he locks eyes with that young woman Leisurely is talking to.
[00:37] <03Crion> 4He pauses for a moment, then gives a broad, squinting smile and turns away.
01[00:37] <03banana> "For the war- I worked in San Diego, Lady Foster. Baron Murray had me watching movements, setting up nasty surprises."
[00:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The ballet's fine. It could use more dogs, but that's true of all art. How are the flowers?"
01[00:38] <03banana> "Probably better not go back for a while, right?" 6KJ's visibly distracted, by Clinton Cavanaugh being visibly distracted, by her. Well. It will be interesting to see what he thinks she thinks.
[00:40] <03Quaker> When his gaze sweeps over the middle once more, Cav will notice that the Prince has vanished. 
[00:40] <03Quaker> The Countess-Palatine scrolls through her phone, hand unheld. 
[00:41] <03Quaker> Blythe: “The flowers are doing well. The soil up there is more nourishing than most would assume. Are you going to visit and see the new blooms this season?” 
[00:42] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Oh, I’m not a Lady or anything. Just a plus one. In the platonic sense. I just wanted to see the ballet.” 
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav's gaze lingers on the woman talking to Leisurely a bit longer than usual, but even as he looks away, he listens -- the way he's learned to listen -- and he hears.
[00:44] <03Quaker> Foster continues. “So you’re with the Security Service?” 
[00:44] <03Crion> 4Baron Murray, huh.
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'd be delighted. It's been a couple of years since I've had the pleasure. What's the best time for that?"
[00:44] <03Crion> 4The Security Service.
[00:44] <03Crion> 4Well then.
01[00:45] <03banana> "Until recently! But it's not really a topic for the ballet, right? You'll have to wait until I finish my memoir."
[00:45] <03Quaker> Blythe smiles. She’s perfectly lovely, he remembers. “Anytime you’d like. My staff always sets the table for others.” 
[00:46] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Oh…what are the topics for the ballet?” 
01[00:46] <03banana> 6KJ: "Social relationships are always in. Your platonic plus one.. you came in with the guy who's watching us, right? That has to be the new Baron Laguna."
[00:48] <03Quaker> The crowd erupts into applause as the orchestra’s conductor bows. Then, in a few moments, the first strains of the performance climb up to them. 
01[00:48] <03banana> 6OK. If this is seriously the sort of duty expected of the Invictus, KJ's going to see if she can enjoy it. Why not.
01[00:49] <03banana> 6Not exactly Hamilton, though, is it?
[00:49] <03tom> 14The second after it would be inappropriate for someone to get up to reprimand him, Tommy squeezes his fists, feels the warm blood rush to his face, and lights up a cigarette.
[00:50] <03tom> 14'Fuck it.'
[00:50] <03tom> 14Being dead and still with tobacco: pure hell.
[00:51] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdy-_3C34Uc
[00:52] <03Crion> 4Cav will watch the performance, and try not to openly bristle at what's happening behind him.
[00:52] <03Crion> 4After all. Lots of people know Baron Murray. Right?
[00:54] <03Quaker> More than would like to, says the Prince in his head. 
[00:54] <03Quaker> Ha ha! 
[00:55] <03Quaker> Hello, Baron! Get that man to stop smoking at once or I’m going to throw him over the balcony. Thank you. 
[00:55] <03Crion> 4Oh Jesus Christ.
[00:55] <03Crion> 4My Prince.
[00:55] <03Crion> 4Of course.
[00:55] <03Crion> 4At once.
[00:56] <03Crion> 4Cav stands and -- ah. The Deacon. Soltana? Soldana? Whatever.
[00:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Damn. Haven't seen a white kid forced to play Usher like this since Justin Bieber.
[00:57] <03Quaker> The Prince appears next to the Countess Lancaster, leaning in with intent. “See? Kausky’s off. I knew we should have picked the other woman. So much for vetting.” 
[00:57] <03tom> 14He hears someone stand and turns in his seat, eyes widening very slightly.
[00:57] <03Crion> 4He'll walk over to -- fuck you, Hollywood -- he'll walk over to the Deacon and lean in real close. "Hey there, Deacon. I need you to put that out right now."
[00:57] <03Crion> "Not me asking."
01[00:57] <03banana> 6Actually, the music's great. It's a bit hard to watch the dancers, though, with the burning spark one row away, what the fuck. KJ's going to have to go looking for her mood again in a moment...
[00:57] <03Quaker> Blythe: “She’s borrowing her violin from the fifth-chair.” 
[00:57] <03tom> "-Yeah. Yeah. I was done already."
[00:58] <03Crion> "That's good to hear."
[00:58] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Again. Not me asking. The Prince wishes you a nice evening."
[00:59] <03Quaker> Bailey shakes his head. “I’ve heard her on her regular piece. Hello, Wilson, good to see you out. She’s too rigid.” He sighs. “I don’t know why Tanner would move to Philadelphia and make us find a replacement. It’s not as if we don’t pay double what they do.” 
[00:59] <03Quaker> Clarabelle is glaring a laser beam through the Deacon. 
[00:59] <03tom> 14He inhales sharply and hands off the still-smoldering butt to one of the help, then spends the next several minutes stock still in his chair.
[01:01] <03Quaker> Rosa finally takes her seat, next to the Deacon. “Good evening. Enjoying yourselves?” 
[01:03] <03Quaker> Leisurely doesn’t seem to have noticed the very minor breach in etiquette. Instead, she’s leaning forward, watching the dancers. 
[01:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "My Prince," 10Frost says to Bailey. You get used to things like this, in this town. "Maybe Tanner moved to Philadelphia for the scenery. Or the people."
[01:04] <03Quaker> A young noblewoman is saying goodbye to her knightly love as he departs for the Holy Land and the crusades. There’s a lot of hopping and people being caught. 
01[01:05] <03banana> 6KJ wants to watch, kinda... but what was that? Baron Cavanaugh is the Prince's personal enforcer, now? KJ didn't see any kind of signal and she's good at noticing signals.
[01:05] <03Crion> 4...To be honest? He's not hating this.
01[01:05] <03banana> 6She really needs to read that sales brochure on the Shepherds. This is going to be a real shit of a time.
[01:05] <03Crion> 4Cav likes the dancing a whole lot more than the music, though. The fluid movement.
[01:06] <03Crion> 4Hopefully he'll be given a chance to concentrate on it, from here on out. If that's okay with the Prince.
[01:07] <03Quaker> Bailey: “We have better in both. There’s no accounting for taste.” He watches for a while. “Vazquez is really excellent, Blythe. Great choice. Much more graceful here than in the auditions.” 
[01:07] <03Quaker> Countess Lancaster nods. 
[01:07] <03Quaker> There’s nobody in Cav’s head. 
[01:07] <03Crion> 4Uh huh.
01[01:09] <03banana> 6Are the programmes on the seats? It'd be nice to look up the composer without interrupting Ms. Foster.
01[01:09] <03banana> 6*are there
[01:10] <03Crion> 4Cav will lose himself in the performance, then.
[01:10] <03Quaker> There aren’t. 
01[01:11] <03banana> 6It's not KJ's fucking night.
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson takes in the show. It's a fine show, for what it is.
[01:12] <03Quaker> The Prince looks at Wilson. “Do you know the people in the other box?” 
[01:12] <03Quaker> “The new ones.” 
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I know Valentine a little."
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "One of Helena's, last I heard."
[01:14] <03Quaker> “A computers expert. The rest?” 
[01:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Who do you mean?"
[01:16] <03tom> "Yeah, I'm- yeah, s'fine. No problems here, right?"
[01:17] <03Quaker> “The new Barons. Valentine and Cavanaugh.” 
[01:17] <03tom> 14Saldana is uncreasing his collar.
[01:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Cavanaugh's the New Yorker? Only by reputation. Team player without a lot of team spirit." 10Wilson settles into his seat a little more. "Hell of a beat he got. Hope he likes to drive."
[01:19] <03Quaker> Rosa’s smile is calming. Hopefully. “No, no. Please - relax. The Prince just gets…he puts effort into this. If something deviates from his vision, he tries to correct it. Even if it’s a bit rude in the process. You know how our elders are.” 
[01:20] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “What did you do? During the conflict.” 
[01:22] <03Quaker> Bailey rests his chin in a hand and watches. “He’s very New York. What’s that idiotic phrase that’s in fashion? Culture fit?” 
[01:22] <03Quaker> “As if people can’t change.” 
01[01:22] <03banana> 6Guess she's not going to be taking in the show. ..who is this woman Wilson's left KJ with? She didn't respond to the question about probably-Cavanaugh watching them, and she's very interested in the kind of work which, it is generally understood, is not discussed in detail.
[01:23] <03tom> 14You better believe I fuckin' do. "Yeah.. yeah, alright. If it's not a trouble, let him know I'm sorry. Really, new guy in town, y'know-" 14He gestures, open-palmed. 
01[01:24] <03banana> "Ultimately, murder. Enemy ghouls. I shouldn't have brought it up."
[01:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The people who say 'culture fit' don't want people to change. They want people who fit in without any extra effort. Question always is, what makes the new guy happy, and what makes everyone else happy with the new guy?"
[01:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Assuming you're in the happiness business, anyhow."
[01:25] <03Quaker> Bailey gestures at the performance. “ You tell me. Anyway. You know we bought him? You remember the people. No, nevermind, you weren’t there. Even wider smiles, even shorter tempers.” 
[01:25] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Are you? New, I mean.” 
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "How's the warranty?"
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Buying people is... I guess a thing we do? Wilson's gonna assume it is, for Bailey to be so glib about it. Not like what we normally do is any better.
[01:27] <03Crion> 4Cav can't say he's going to like, be coming back to watch more ballet.
[01:27] <03Crion> 4But this is really good.
01[01:29] <03banana> 6KJ's tone isn't hostile. Leisurely might detect someone who's in the habit of never really ending a conversation. But she's clearly trying to change the topic, at least. 
[01:30] <03Quaker> “Well, I’m being glib. We bought his assignment. Nothing wrong with him, actually. I like him a great deal. But it’s the whole….” He waves his hand, looking for the word. 
[01:30] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Milieu.” 
[01:30] <03Quaker> Bailey: “Thank you. The strings attached.” 
[01:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> "From the New Yorkers."
[01:31] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Did you enjoy your work?” 
[01:31] <03tom> "New to L.A., not the game. I'm with Soria's guys, y'know, but I do my part for the community."
[01:31] <03tom> 14Tommy keeps one eye on the performance in case there's a quiz later.
[01:31] <03Quaker> Rosa settles into her seat, one leg resting on the other. “What part is that?” 
[01:33] <03tom> "I broke a few kneecaps in that scuffle over the county. Nothing to brag about..."
[01:34] <03Quaker> Bailey: “Yes. That, and some…reactions the whole thing’s inspired. From certain quarters. His presence here, and my favor.” He exhales in exasperation. “The whole thing is too oblique for my tastes. But, you know. The balancing act.” 
[01:34] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Holy muscle.” 
[01:35] <03tom> 14He waffles a bit, decides not to contest it. "It takes all kinds."
[01:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Hey. If your job was easy, anyone could do it."
01[01:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "..."
01[01:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "I enjoyed it as a technical exercise. Ms. Foster, I'd like to know why you ask- amateur psychology, is it?"
[01:36] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Not really. Just curious.” 
01[01:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "You must have been here a while, as Baron Frost alluded. Have you been required to participate in anything of that sort?"
[01:40] <03Quaker> Bailey pauses for a moment, glancing at Lancaster for a long moment. She laughs. Then, back to Wilson. “I have to be a bit hands-off for a few months. At least after the whole San Diego fiasco. Too much time pulling people in a certain direction, and they start to tire of it. So no help for the Baron Laguna from me, I’m afraid. Not for a while. Not even clandestinely. Not that I wouldn’t love to give him a sack of guns and money-“ He 
[01:40] <03Quaker> waves his hand, terminating the thought. “I have a favor to ask of you.” 
[01:41] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “No, not really. They couldn’t make me do it, anyway. I’d just…leave.” 
[01:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson was hoping this part of the conversation would never materialize. Alas! "How can I be of service?"
01[01:41] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah? You've got the status to do that, or the personal capability? Somewhere to go, if you need to go?"
[01:42] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Well. I can’t die. So I’m not really afraid of them.” 
01[01:45] <03banana> 6She's a crazy person. That makes her safe. A non factor. Very quietly - it's really a whisper of shadow in the air, because she can do that now, KJ says: "I am."
[01:45] <03Crion> 4It's not that Cav hasn't moved in...however long this program has gone; he's been shifting, slightly fidgeting, very occasionally checking his phone on act or scene breaks -- but the point of nights like this is to Do Politics. All around him, various unliving people of various dispositions are having quiet conversations, paying the ballet attention only insomuch as it doesn't distract 
[01:45] <03Crion> 4from their other, more important goals of attendance.
[01:45] <03Crion> 4Cav, on the other hand, is watching.
[01:46] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Don’t think I’m judging you for anything. I remember when I had to throw people through windows. You’re actually the first Carmelite I’ve met - it’s all been through intermediaries up to know. I think it’s fascinating, really. There was a point in my life where I considered the priesthood. Now I guess it’s just an academic interest. Oh, Presbyter Vincent will remember, once I audited a class of hers at St. Chrys’s- 
[01:46] <03Quaker> sorry, I don’t mean to make you talk about this if you don’t want to. I know you must get tired of it.” 
[01:46] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Why?” 
[01:48] <03Quaker> Bailey: “Do you feel like making a new friend?” 
01[01:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "Here's my next guess, if you aren't the therapy type- you're a people-watcher. More interested in inner lives than the exterior movements of the world."
01[01:50] <03banana> 6She's speaking normally again, now. If anything about this conversation can be called normal. ..actually it wouldn't have been out of place at college, at one of the parties with the good stuff...
01[01:50] <03banana> 6Heck of weird for an Invictus social, though.
[01:50] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I think they’re the same thing.” 
[01:51] <03tom> 14Tommy rubs his chin and chances a glance over at Clarabelle in the hope that she isn't still glaring. "And a professor, too? Wow, I'm starting to feel a bit underqualified."
[01:52] <03tom> "-I'm learning from Soria, I mean. Before this month, I had sort of.. fallen out with God."
[01:52] <03Quaker> Clarabelle isn’t. She answers: “It was just one seminar. For my graduate program.” 
[01:52] <03Quaker> Rosa: “How does one fall out with God?” 
[01:52] <03Crion> 4Very carefully.
[01:53] <03tom> "It's the easiest thing in the world. You just stop going."
[01:53] <03tom> 14He rubs his temples. "Gee, really put me on the spot here."
[01:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't, frankly. Does that matter?"
01[01:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "There we go. Not that I totally disagree with you? But peoples' lives are so mediated by literal and social structures. Understanding someone's thoughts isn't the same as understanding the effect they have on the world, thankfully."
[01:54] <03Quaker> Rosa smiles playfully. “I’d hope a Deacon would be up to talking about his faith. Especially with so many looking up to you.” 
[01:55] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “What do you do now?” 
[01:55] <03Quaker> Bailey watches the play for a while. 
[01:56] <03Quaker> Then: “We’d both like to avoid the 70s ever returning.” It’s not really a question. 
[01:56] <03tom> 14Can't argue that. "Fair's fair."
[01:57] <03tom> "Soria and his guys are theologians. That's not enough. You gotta have temporal power too."
01[01:57] <03banana> "Understand the effect people have on the world. It's easier." 6KJ, after a beat: "I mean that I do what you'd expect- watch who passes through Anaheim, ensure they're following the rules which make sure they don't get in each others' way. I try to keep up with Javascript in my spare time, but it's pretty batshit these days."
[01:57] <03Quaker> There’s an usher gingerly tapping Cav’s shoulder. “Baron…the Countess-Palatine would like to ask if you would honor her with your company.” 
01[01:57] <03banana> "Yourself?"
[01:58] <03Crion> 4...
[01:58] <03Crion> 4This wouldn't be the first trap of this sort he's walked into.
[01:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks like he's watching the ballet, but the blood pounding in his ears means he couldn't even if he wanted to. After another half-movement or so: "...what do you need?"
[01:58] <03Crion> 4But that doesn't seem like this court's style.
[01:58] <03Crion> 4So Cavanaugh nods, dismisses the usher, stands, and walks on over.
[01:59] <03tom> "So we cut a deal when I came to town. I work for Soria, and he's helping me put things right, you know... with God."
[01:59] <03Crion> 4A deep bow that might be disguised as him leaning over to sit down, but whose initial intent is clear. "My Lady."
[02:00] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I read a lot. And I have an ice cream stand. I used to sell pot.” 
[02:00] <03Crion> 4She did!
[02:02] <03Quaker> Rosa: “The Bishops could offer you the same thing. Absolution. Why pick the Carmelites?” 
[02:02] <03Quaker> The Countess-Palatine looks up. “Hello, Baron. Please, sit. Are you enjoying the performance?” 
01[02:02] <03banana> 6KJ: "That all sounds like stuff that needs doing. Did, uh, legalisation mess with your thing?"
[02:02] <03tom> 14He can't give more than a half-hearted shrug. "Better sales pitch I guess."
[02:02] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Which was…?” 
[02:02] <03tom> "I don't have to burn in hell forever."
[02:02] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh sits. "Unexpectedly so."
[02:03] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I just got tired of it. Did you get tired of your work?” 
01[02:04] <03banana> "Ms. Foster. Leisurely. It's two thousand sixteen! Three years is the longest I've ever had one job at a time."
[02:04] <03Quaker> The Prince stands. “Keep an eye on Cavanaugh. I imagine he’ll be involved in some tangled scheme sooner rather than later. I’d like to have someone beside him who knows what’s at stake. And who is also not intimately involved with me.” 
[02:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You don't think there's a risk he's going to find that patronizing?"
[02:05] <03Quaker> Leisurely looks stressed for a second. “It is…?” She pulls out her notebook, which still has a ‘2013’ on its header. 
01[02:06] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hahaha! I'm never going to get used to the pace of things down here. It's kind of nice. Kind of."
01[02:07] <03banana> 6Also, ripe for disruption. Kind of.

[02:30] <03Quaker> If she detects the lie, she doesn’t press him on it. “Some take to it more naturally than others. The exercise of power can be an uncomfortable thing to learn.” 
[02:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'm familiar with its consequences."
[02:32] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I do what I am bidden to do by my betters, my lady."
[02:32] <03Quaker> The Countess-Palatine gingerly pats his hand. “Then I’m sure you’ll make a wonderful Baron.” Her accent is very faint. 
[02:32] <03Crion> 4Left unsaid is who, precisely, he considers his betters.
[02:34] <03Crion> 4Out loud: "Thank you, my lady."
[02:35] <03Quaker> Tommy realizes that he does remember what Rubellians believe, thanks to Soria’s exhaustive tutoring. The Book of Eschaton mentions a single Kindred, dressed in red, being spared by God. Rubellians, which make up about a third of all Orthodox Kindred in the world, hold that this means that God’s divine freedom grants a theoretical possibility of salvation for Kindred. However, whether it is something Kindred can actively seek out, or whethe
[02:35] <03Quaker> it even applies to more than a single prophesied Kindred, is fiercely debated. The possiblity remains theoretical, of course, and it remains heresy to preach that it has applied or will apply to any single individual. 
01[02:36] <03banana> 6How many of them wear red just in case, though.
[02:38] <03Quaker> It is, practically speaking, a good way of not going insane with murderous grief in the service of the Lord. Hope, after all, remains a virtue. 
[02:38] <03tom> "Soria got me first. I hadn't even heard of them until he told me about 'em."
[02:38] <03tom> "Not that I'm complaining. They're not enemies."
[02:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I gotta ask, though."
[02:39] <03Quaker> Solano: “I was sorry to hear about that unpleasant business with the Carmelites on your land. I’m sure you were relieved when you found out none of it was technically your responsibility.” 
[02:40] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Do you still work for Murray?” 
[02:41] <03Crion> 4Cav just looks over at the Countess-Palatine.
[02:42] <03Crion> "The what."
[02:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Why me? I'm not exactly the friendliest guy around. If I start being buddy-buddy all of a sudden it's gonna raise eyebrows. And you know that. He'll figure it out too. What message am I supposed to be sending? Who's supposed to see this?"
[02:42] <03Crion> "...My lady."
[02:43] <03Quaker> Solano: “A Carmelite attacking an agent of a Court noble? I suppose it was bound to happen, sooner rather than later. And a man in Count Bren’s service. I don’t think that poor Carmelite could have chosen a worse target for his anger. I understand that it was just some small brawl. Of course, the penalty remains the same.” 
[02:44] <03Quaker> Bailey: “You’re good at being seen when you want to be seen, Wilson. And remaining hidden when you want to remain hidden. Can you keep doing that? Visible to your friends, and invisible to my…potential….enemies?” 
[02:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What if Cavanaugh is both?"
[02:45] <03Quaker> Bailey: “Then tell Blythe.” 
01[02:45] <03banana> 6KJ's about to say "If needed," and then suddenly she's not so sure it's true. Is 'work for' the same as 'team brought back together for one last job, putting it all on the line'? How about 'threatened with enslavement by'?
[02:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "He's Savage, right?"
01[02:45] <03banana> 6Heck, it's not an at-will state.
[02:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He got the-" 10Wilson mimes a clawing gesture.
[02:46] <03Quaker> Bailey laughs. “Please, Wilson. It’s 2013.” 
[02:46] <03Quaker> “They’re called Gangrel.” 
[02:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10But it's actually- "See I always thought that sounded dumber."
01[02:46] <03banana> "Oh, yeah, if necessary. But we're not going to have another war any time soon."
[02:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But your point's well-taken."
[02:46] <03Crion> 4Clinton Cavanaugh: "...That is, yes...quite the predicament. A Carmelite, and a man in Count Bren's service. And on my land. Frankly, my lady, my main concern was that I was not informed sooner, given what would have otherwise been my inherent responsibility."
[02:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm just asking, if he decides I'm his enemy, do I have ten seconds or five?"
[02:48] <03Crion> 4It is hard to accurately describe how uselessly angry the Shepherd is at this particular moment.
[02:49] <03Quaker> Bailey: “That’s how I like my points. You’ll have an eternity, if you can hide well.” He thinks it over. “Better to stay at arms-length, though, probably. I mean that literally. The claws.” 
[02:50] <03Quaker> Solano: “Do you have any, if you weren’t there to stop it in the first place? I believe that, legally, you’re quite unencumbered.” 
[02:51] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “You’d be ready to kill again?” 
[02:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "And I shouldn't interpret this important task as punishment, right?"
[02:51] <03Quaker> Bailey: “Failure would be its own punishment. As I’m sure you’ll quickly discover.” 
[02:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Man. Wilson absolutely should have stayed home tonight.
01[02:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Look, I don't know what kind of ballet you're used to."
[02:53] <03Quaker> The seneschal takes Tommy’s point. “I guess we should all try to be that ecumenical, considering. What did you come to the ballet for, anyway?” 
[02:53] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I’m not used to ballet.” 
01[02:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "If you want me to kill someone, the answer's probably gonna be no. I guess if some sort of severe crime was committed in my territory, and they needed an execution? But I'd be asking for someone higher up to handle it if possible."

01[03:00] <03banana> "Are you familiar with the Invictus?"
[03:00] <03Crion> 4He pauses. "And perhaps not."
[03:00] <03Quaker> The Prince gets up and leaves the quiet box. “Thank you, Wilson. I hope everything’s going well, besides.” 
[03:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Can't complain."
[03:01] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I am.” 
01[03:02] <03banana> 6KJ: "Perhaps I should take your question as, who do you, KJ- call me KJ, did I say that?- who do you think would be offended by probing into killing and culpability? Who are you awre of or willing to name in this context?"
01[03:02] <03banana> 6*aware
[03:02] <03Quaker> Clarabelle speaks up. “There was an incident with a Carmelite attacking - alledgedly - one of Donald Bren’s men in Dana Point. We have a few days to have him in custody. We wanted to talk to Baron Cavanaugh, whose land it took place on.” 
[03:03] <03Quaker> Leisurely tries to follow the sentence, and fails. “…huh?” 
[03:03] <03Quaker> Blythe puts her hat back on. “Welcome back, Wilson.” 
[03:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Countess, be straight with me. This is an actual thing, right? This isn't Bailey making the asshole and the shut-in learn the true meaning of friendship?"
[03:05] <03Crion> 4Which is which, though.
01[03:05] <03banana> 6KJ deflates slightly. "Just what do you read all day?"
01[03:06] <03banana> 6What a strange person. It's a bit like talking to a mirror.. or from the therapist's couch. 
[03:06] <03Quaker> Solano makes a vague motion of agreement. “Insight is something even dearer than power exercised justly. Well, I hope you find both.” The Prince reappears, sitting next to his wife, as they join hands once again. “Evening, Baron.” He closes his eyes and leans back in the leather seat. 
[03:06] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh squints and smiles. "My lord."
01[03:06] <03banana> 6She feels like the other woman is taking advantage, somehow, of KJ's willingness to discuss her favourite topic (KJ). Also, she's missed half the performance.
[03:07] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Am I dismissed?"
[03:07] <03Crion> "I'd like to take in the rest of the show."
[03:07] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Books about the soul. And other things. I guess you could call it the esoteric.” 
01[03:07] <03banana> 6..shit, where's Clinton Cavanaugh? Ah. He moved seats.
[03:08] <03Quaker> The Countess-Palatine nods. “Thank you for the conversation, Baron. If you need anything…” The dismissal is silent. 
01[03:08] <03banana> "Well, it's a popular topic right now. A Carmelite turned up at my offices last week with some gospels to hand out."
[03:08] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “And?” 
[03:08] <03Crion> 4He'll bow again, and head back to his original seat. But not without a look back to Leisurely and that woman.
01[03:08] <03banana> "Uh, haven't read them yet. I'll let you know if they're any good."
[03:09] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Are you interested in the subject?” 
[03:09] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Speaking of…Deacon, we’d better catch him now, while he’s free.” 
[03:10] <03Quaker> Perhaps it was cruel to speak of friendship in Blythe Sulzberger’s presence. Regardless, she answers his question. “I’m involved, aren’t I? And I only deal in real things.” 
[03:11] <03tom> "On it." 14Tommy's up, striding to intercept the Baron before he can reach his seat.
01[03:11] <03banana> 6KJ shrugs. "You have to keep up with current events."
[03:11] <03Crion> 4Cav will hold up, then. The smoker.
[03:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "This sit all right with you?"
[03:11] <03Crion> 4Deacon...
[03:11] <03tom> "Hey."
[03:11] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “No, I mean the subject of the soul.” 
[03:12] <03Quaker> Clarabelle follows behind. “Hi, Baron. Just wanted a quick audience.” 
[03:12] <03Crion> 4...Tommy Saldana.
[03:12] <03tom> 14He rubs the back of his neck. His hand comes back cold and clammy. 
[03:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Deacon Saldana."
[03:13] <03Crion> "...My seat's over there."
[03:13] <03Crion> "But you knew that."
[03:13] <03Crion> "Join me."
[03:13] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I would do it. But.” 
[03:13] <03tom> 14That's perfectly reasonable. He follows.
01[03:13] <03banana> 6No. "As you say, it's esoteric. Perhaps we'll all have our minds uploaded in time to avoid the question."
[03:14] <03Crion> 4Once they've sat down: "So now we both know what this is about."
[03:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks over. But...?
[03:14] <03Crion> "Cosmo Morgan got up to some shit. Yeah?"
[03:14] <03tom> 14His expression is grim. "Yeah."
[03:14] <03Crion> "Who's your guy?"
[03:14] <03tom> "I don't know what Sponger did, but we have three days to produce him or a shitstorm like we've never seen is gonna hit us."
[03:14] <03Crion> "Sponger."
[03:15] <03Crion> 4Cav sighs.
[03:15] <03Crion> "That's a unique name."
[03:15] <03tom> "Know'em?"
[03:15] <03Crion> "Not well."
[03:15] <03Crion> "But I'll tell you something true, Deacon. I'd have helped him fuck up Cosmo Morgan if I was there myself."
[03:16] <03Crion> "...Produce him to whom?"
[03:16] <03Crion> 4This is a legitimate question; Cav needs to know if this is going through the Judex or not.
[03:17] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Judex Rainey.” 
[03:17] <03Crion> "Well then."
[03:17] <03tom> "We got the order from Zealous Morse."
[03:17] <03Crion> 4Cav's upper lip twists into a sneer. "Oh."
[03:18] <03Quaker> Blythe: “You know how my attempts at getting close to others turn out.” 
[03:18] <03tom> "...What'd Morgan do to piss you off?"
[03:18] <03Crion> 4Cav leans forward. "He was Cosmo Morgan."
[03:18] <03Crion> "I have staff."
[03:18] <03tom> 14He raises his palms. "I don't know the guy."
[03:18] <03Crion> "They have experience in the Judex's office."
[03:18] <03Crion> "We can offer representation to Sponger."
[03:18] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Uploaded to what?” 
[03:18] <03tom> "Shit, I barely know Sponger. I been here a month, month and a half."
[03:19] <03tom> "Oh?"
[03:19] <03tom> "Well, if that's true, it still doesn't help us. We have no idea where he is. It doesn't help or hurt him to let you know that."
[03:19] <03Crion> 4To Saldana: "I barely know him, too. But I know Morgan. And Sponger would have to have done some shit to outweigh that with me."
[03:20] <03Crion> 4He sighs. "He's in my territory, though."
01[03:20] <03banana> 6KJ: "AWS or Azure, these days." 6She clarifies: "The cloud." 6She clarifies: "Somebody else's computer."
[03:20] <03tom> "I mean.. yeah. We still gotta.."
[03:20] <03Crion> "Did he at least torpor that smarmy motherfucker?"
[03:21] <03tom> 14Shakes his head. "He broke the most important rule of all."
[03:21] <03Crion> 4Cav: "No he didn't."
01[03:21] <03banana> 6KJ: "I mean.. I guess you'd need a blood cloud? Not sure how that would work."
[03:21] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Would it take you? In your current state?” 
[03:21] <03tom> "Heh, yeah he did; don't get caught doing it."
01[03:21] <03banana> "That is a very good question."
[03:21] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You're wrong."
[03:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson sighs. He does. "Well hey, it's like the Prince says. People can change, yeah? I'm gonna come up to Lancaster and see your flowers."
[03:21] <03Crion> "He hasn't been caught yet."
[03:23] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I’ll pick some to cut for you. The fact is, something makes you happy really is rotten unless you can share it with someone.” 
[03:23] <03tom> "Well... it's not much better. Morgan was able to ID him, and now they're out for blood. I don't know how it comes out any different for Sponger."
[03:24] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Morgan only matters as much as Bren matters, and Bren only matters as much as his relationship with power matters, and his relationship with power matters only as much as what can be proved in court."
[03:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson pulls out his flask. "Yeah. I know that one for sure."
[03:24] <03Quaker> The finale’s great crescendo rises and crashes over them. Raymonda and her love are finally together, and dozens of costumed courtiers dance as the King of Hungary gives them his blessing. 
[03:25] <03Quaker> Blythe takes the flask and a swig. “You should go find your guy.” 
[03:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson takes the flask back and empties it. "Yeah. It was nice to see you, Blythe."
[03:26] <03Quaker> The Countess Lancaster goes back to considering how her project is turning out. 
[03:26] <03tom> 14Saldana is quiet for a little while. He tries to gauge Clarabelle's reaction to this.
[03:26] <03Crion> 4Cav: "So the picture gets bigger here, yeah? Don't make the mistake of thinking Donald Bren gives a fuck about the dignity or safety of Cosmo Morgan. Donald Bren doesn't care about anything. Donald Bren doesn't care about God. He doesn't care about relationships. He only barely cares about capitalism. He wants to own the Judex. He's not about to undermine it."
[03:27] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “We just need your help finding Souza, Baron. We can’t afford to get caught up in something bigger right now. There’s too many people just finding their feet for the first time.” 
[03:27] <03Crion> 4Cav watches the finale. "Presbyter, it doesn't sound like you have much of a choice."
[03:28] <03Crion> "They asked. You have to answer."
[03:28] <03Crion> "We can do this through the system, or we can do it outside of it."
[03:28] <03Crion> "But we still have to do it."
[03:28] <03tom> 14Tommy produces a pen and scrap of paper and scribbles on it. He extends it to Cavanaugh. "Here's my number."
01[03:28] <03banana> 6Actually, this is interesting. We're just a brain in a body, right? But it's a really weird body, now. Does the mind adapt? If we were, like, digitized, could any of our strengths and weaknesses come through as what would be pure thought patterns? KJ's not saying any of that out loud, not unless realllly high. 
01[03:28] <03banana> 6Oddly, she feels a bit better.
[03:28] <03Crion> 4Cav takes the piece of paper.
[03:29] <03Quaker> Clarabelle thinks about it. 
[03:29] <03Crion> 4It'll go into his contacts, and Tommy Saldana's name will go into his notes app.
[03:29] <03tom> "Tomorrow night I'd like to drop by Laguna Beach- with your blessing- and see if we can piece this together."
[03:29] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Tomorrow night's date night."
[03:29] <03tom> "Fuck man, I don't know what to tell you. We have three nights, and tonight's night one."
[03:29] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah, well."
[03:29] <03tom> "I'll go by myself if you can give me permission."
[03:30] <03Crion> 4Cav: "It turns out I care less about Zealous Morse's feelings than you do."
[03:30] <03tom> "He's not hanging over your head like the sword of fuckin' Damocles."
[03:30] <03Crion> 4Cav: "We'll be filing a motion to postpone before 2 AM."
[03:30] <03tom> "Fine."
[03:31] <03tom> "You call that number when you want me to drop by, and then we'll see what we can do for Sponger."
[03:31] <03Quaker> As he leaves the box, Wilson runs into someone walking through the hallway. 
[03:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh?
[03:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And if Zealous has a problem with that he has my office number, and he can come speak to me if he can't understand my people's explanations."
[03:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And you can tell him the precise language of what I just said."
[03:31] <03tom> "Yeah, yeah.."
[03:32] <03Crion> "And that next time he wants something in my territory, he can come talk to me first."
01[03:32] <03banana> 6Hell of a conversation to have in public around people with Auspex. Including Prince Bailey just over there. KJ's not sure whether this will count as news to report, but it does give her some indication into why people are concerned about Clinton Cavanaugh.
[03:33] <03Quaker> Valeria Lewis looks just as surprised to see him here. In the years since he last saw her, she’s exchanged her long coat for a leather jacket, and cut her hair short. Her mouth works for a moment, while she thinks. And when she can’t think of anything, she lowers her eyes and continues past. 
[03:33] <03Crion> 4Turns out that when you have rights, you can enforce them.
[03:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson keeps it cool. Nothing to say to her.
[03:33] <03Crion> 4Don't think Cavanaugh hasn't been keeping an eye on the striking young woman who was talking to Leisurely.
[03:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He ducks in to the other box and finds everybody up the New Yorker's ass.
[03:34] <03tom> 14The Deacon exhales through his nose, and when he turns round to face Cavanaugh again, Tommy is smiling. "And Baron..."
[03:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This is just not gonna be his spring, is it?
[03:34] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Deacon."
[03:34] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Do you ever have dreams?” 
[03:34] <03tom> "Thanks."
[03:35] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Not a problem, Deacon. And hey."
[03:35] <03Crion> "In the future."
[03:35] <03Crion> "Call me Cav."
01[03:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "My understanding is that if I make it fifty or a hundred years, then sleep for about that long, dreams come back."
[03:36] <03tom> "I'll remember that," 14he nods as he speaks.
01[03:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "Interesting implications, right- rather than being dead, are we just living very slowly? A hundred years as a day?"
[03:36] <03Crion> "Take it easy, Deacon," 4Cav says. "I'll see you two nights from now."
[03:36] <03Crion> 4He looks around the room. Is Morse here?
[03:37] <03Quaker> Leisurely smiles. “Those aren’t dreams. Any more than a lightbulb is the sun.” 
[03:37] <03Quaker> He is not. 
[03:37] <03tom> "Same to you." 14To Clarabelle: "Good enough?"
01[03:38] <03banana> 6KJ raises one eyebrow, which took about five weeks' practice when she was fifteen: "You've experienced torpor?"
[03:38] <03Crion> 4Coward piece of shit asshole motherfucker.
[03:38] <03Crion> 4...Cav takes a deep breath.
[03:38] <03Crion> 4He's supposed to be working on this.
[03:39] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I have.” 
[03:40] <03Crion> 4Cav stands when they do. "Good night, Deacon. Presbyter."
[03:41] <03tom> "Be seeing you."
[03:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Great, he's in a bad mood. This is the perfect time. Wilson weaves between the departing missionaries to stand before Cav. "Baron Cavanaugh, do I have that right?"
01[03:43] <03banana> 6Maybe this explains a lot. "I'll take your word for it!"
01[03:43] <03banana> "Why the rhetorical question?"
[03:43] <03Crion> 4To the Deacon: "You will."
[03:43] <03Crion> 4And now the newcom--
[03:44] <03tom> 14The moment he's out the building- with or without Clarabell- Tommy lights up a cigarette and pounds his fist against the wall. "Fucking Chr-" 14He stops himself. "Shiit."
[03:44] <03tom> 14Clarabelle*
[03:44] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “What’s wrong?” 
[03:45] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “It wasn’t rhetorical. Just wondering.” 
[03:45] <03Crion> 4...This guy.
[03:45] <03tom> "I almost got killed back there. First big night on the town and I fuck up so bad."
[03:45] <03Crion> 4The smaller man in the tux from before, yeah, but also Cav saw him...fucking where? What was the last big party this guy attended?
[03:45] <03tom> "You woulda handled this better without me."
[03:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Would've been whichever was the last party Cav attended. Baron Hollywood's at all of them.
01[03:47] <03banana> 6Now someone else's taking to Baron Laguna. You know what, that's fine. Maybe KJ was just destined to fail here, she'll just go and get viciously mindwiped or whatever. This is fine. Wait, how is it not rhetorical? She returns some degree of focus to Leisurely Foster.
01[03:48] <03banana> "Why would you think I have dream? None of us do. Not literal REM sleep. Sometimes I wonder about the other kind."
01[03:48] <03banana> *dreams
[03:48] <03Crion> 4Well whatever it was, it was before Cav himself was a baron. Was it the spring...thing? The dance?
[03:48] <03Crion> 4This fucking Gangrel mind.
[03:48] <03Crion> 4He's at least Invictus, though.
[03:48] <03Crion> 4But of course.
[03:49] <03Crion> 4Cav extends a hand and smiles, slightly squinting. "Can't say why not."
[03:49] <03Quaker> The Presbyter puts a hand on his shoulder. “You did fine. Take it easy. If it was just me, I’d have no way of offering to help look for Souza. You’re the one who can help make sure that we’re not just another pawn in their games.” 
[03:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson shakes it. Firm grip, Blushing, little clammy. An old man handshake. "How you doing? Wilson Frost. You got a minute?"
[03:51] <03tom> 14He smokes in silence until her hand drops away. "Ok."
[03:52] <03tom> "Thank God every single one of these assholes hates eachother more than they hate us."
[03:52] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs. "Do I have a minute. Yes I do." 4He looks around the room. Lot of people look back, thanks to the last few minutes. "I'm sure all these people want to go down and congratulate the dancers, anyway. On their performance."
[03:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It was a good show. You a fan of ballet?"
01[03:52] <03banana> 6KJ's not actually one of them, because she's engrossed with these weird ass questions.
[03:53] <03Crion> 4Baron Laguna laughs again. "I wasn't before, but I am now."
[03:53] <03Crion> "You don't get to appreciate stuff like this when you're working all the time."
[03:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's why I like the quiet box. Seems like a lot of people were working over here."
[03:56] <03Crion> 4Cav's smile broadens. "Yeah. You want to get some air?"
[03:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah. There's usually an awning up if it's still raining."
[03:57] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well. We're not witches."
[03:58] <03Crion> 4He'll look over to Leisurely one last time to make sure she's fine, then head out to the sidewalk.
[03:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hey, Frost is there with Cavanaugh? What's up with that, KJ?
01[03:58] <03banana> 6Who freaking knows anymore.
01[03:59] <03banana> 6If either Wilson or Cav looks at KJ's side of the conversation she looks somewhere between 100% done and unable-to-look-away-from-trainwreck. 
[03:59] <03Crion> 4He'll keep an eye on the woman who was talking with Leisurely, but he won't like, stop her from following them out, or change his behavior if she does.
[03:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's the Leisurely Foster experience. Chin up, kid.
[03:59] <03tom> 14Tommy hits some buttons on his phone. "There's a car on the way." 14He doesn't look up at Clarabelle. "I'm gonna take a walk."
01[04:00] <03banana> 6KJ's not following anyone before she gets an answer about dreams.
[04:00] <03Crion> 4Don't be an asshole, Hollywood.
[04:00] <03Crion> 4I've done her dishes.
[04:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's your business.
[04:01] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “That’s not true. A lot of us have dreams. Of course, they wish they didn’t. If you have dreams, you have a lot wrong with you. The barriers between things disappear.” 
[04:01] <03Crion> 4That's a savvy observation, becuase it means you know it's not yours.
[04:02] <03Crion> 4Once outside: "So. You've got a title."
[04:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah."
[04:02] <03Crion> 4He resists the urge to take out his phone. "I'm Gangrel."
[04:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Baron Hollywood."
[04:03] <03Crion> 4Cav nods. "Baron Laguna."
[04:03] <03Crion> "I'd shake, but we shook."
01[04:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "That sounds like a psychiatric break. Overexposure to Nosferatu."
[04:04] <03Crion> 4Cav: "How was the quiet box?"
[04:05] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “It’s not a break at all. Instead, you’re discarding the protections your mind built and traveling alone.” 
[04:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not as quiet as I'd like. Is there somewhere we can talk privately? Doesn't have to be tonight, but it should be soon."
[04:05] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Now's good."
[04:05] <03Crion> "You have a car or you need mine?"
01[04:05] <03banana> 6KJ: "Protections against what? Why discard them??"
[04:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I got a car. I'll get the Cora to bring it around. Where are we going?"
01[04:07] <03banana> 6She's just kind of loitering in this emptying opera house trying to understand this baffling.. she now suspects Foster's some sort of once-elder? Mad from torpor? Or an excellent actor in the absurdist school.
[04:07] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'd like to end up back here. Got to drive home. Other than that, well. If you've got landmarks, I've got time."
[04:07] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'm a learner, not a burner.
[04:08] <03Crion> "
[04:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sure, sure." 10Wilson's sending off a text. "You're not just Laguna, right? Dana Point, San Clemente, down to the old power plant..."
[04:10] <03Crion> 4The grin's strained. "Not that old."
[04:10] <03Crion> "But yes."
01[04:10] <03banana> 6Cavanaugh left, with Frost of all people. Doesn't matter too much, she's seen what she needs to. Being sidetracked to this degree probably counts as self-care.
[04:10] <03Crion> "That's my assignment."

[04:11] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Protections from yourself. From seeing the truth of things. And you’d discard them to find that truth.” 
[04:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You must've thumbed someone in the eye pretty hard to end up the Baron of State Route 1. Sorry, that was maybe too frank."
[04:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "It wasn't."
01[04:12] <03banana> 6KJ: "..I'm not in the habit of shielding myself from truths."
[04:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And I did."
[04:13] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Then I twisted."
[04:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Would you do it again?"
[04:13] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That depends."
01[04:14] <03banana> 6KJ: "My work - previous, current, mortal - it's all been about fact-finding, putting pieces together. Whatever mystical sense you're implying, if it provides real information, I bet you I'll pursue it at some point. Who needs protection at that point we'll find out, at that point."
[04:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The car pulls up, driven by a woman in an evening gown, mostly obscured by the windshield wipers. "I mean, knowing what happened - would make the same decision?"
[04:16] <03Crion> 4Cav, without breaking eye contact: "I earned what happened to me a long time ago. So yes. Given the choice between being myself and hiding from myself, I'd choose the truth and then I'd let the consequences hit me in the goddamn face."
[04:17] <03Quaker> Leisurely stands to leave. “There’s some things you don’t want to know. Goodnight, KJ. Good luck with your work.” 
01[04:18] <03banana> 6KJ: "Thanks, but I wish you wouldn't say that like I'll need it."
01[04:19] <03banana> 6Everyone's leaving, now. 
01[04:19] <03banana> 6Q: Why is there always more?
[04:19] <03Quaker> The orchestra puts down its instruments. People are applauding, and then filing out the exits. The notable people in the box are preparing to leave. 
[04:19] <03Quaker> NEXT TIME: 3 Days 
01[04:20] <03banana> 6A: So there's something to do next.
01[04:22] <03banana> 6KJ rests for a moment, focuses on her tasks and her goals. Puts things in their places. She could stand and smile around, look for friendly faces and entitled superiors and the new cohort, but- 
01[04:22] <03banana> 6Actually, tonight she's just gone.
[04:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10...ah. Okay. "You getting in?" 10Wilson opens the rear door.
[04:25] <03Crion> "Yeah." 4Cav stoops his head and slides in.
[04:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The Continental isn't a proper limo but it's got the privacy window jury-rigged in. Once they're inside Cav can only see the woman behind the wheel, not hear her. Once they're inside and they've driven off a ways: "So Bailey ordered me to spy on you."
[04:30] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Bailey talked to me inside my mind tonight."
[04:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Which is my way of saying that I'm not entirely surprised."
[04:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Anything good?"
[04:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "He made me into an usher."
[04:31] <03Crion> "A deacon was smoking, you see."
[04:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts. "You're fucking with me."
[04:31] <03Crion> 4Cav just looks over at him.
[04:31] <03Crion> "So you know me now."
[04:33] <03Crion> "How do you intend to spy on me?"
[04:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I was ordered, if you can believe it, to be your friend. Make sure you weren't plotting against the Brilliant Court. Make sure you weren't a dangerous pawn. Of course, Bailey being Bailey, none of that's hard to believe."
[04:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Fuckin' Barney with fangs."
[04:34] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Ha."
[04:34] <03Crion> "Well."
[04:34] <03Crion> "I could use a friend."
[04:35] <03Crion> "How fucked up are you on Bren/Carmalite disputes?"
[04:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm no more fucked up on Bren than anyone is, which is to say, probably more than I realize. The other thing's not my business at all. I did my bit at Bressi Ranch, past that the schismatics and Widmark and Gorse are all each other's problem, for the moment."
[04:38] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well you're wrong about the second thing. Jesus is everyone's problem in the year of Our Lord 2016. Especially because they can't stop killing each other, or the rest of us."
[04:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Still? Didn't they light up a boat down on Dana Point last winter?"

[04:47] <03Crion> "You friends with Bill Burne?"
[04:47] <03Crion> "Baron North Long Beach."
[04:48] <03Crion> "We know each other well."
[04:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Tall guy? Kind of a Daniel Day Lewis look? No."
[04:48] <03Crion> "That's him."
[04:48] <03Crion> 4He straightens his shoulders. "You have people you care about?"
[04:48] <03Crion> "Driving the car, yeah?"
[04:49] <03Crion> "And otherwise."
[04:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah."
[04:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Then don't get to know Bill Burne."
[04:49] <03Crion> "He'll take that from you."
[04:50] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh is staring out the window now.
[04:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson eyes the minifridge built into the base of the front seat, but he doesn't go for it. Valeria's hair looked good short. "Do you think Burne knows he's got a problem?"
[04:53] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That depends what you mean."
[04:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Does he know what kind of enemy he's made of you?"
[04:54] <03Crion> "Depends if you think Bill Burne views the border patrol as a problem."
[04:55] <03Crion> "I dunno." 4Cav looks away from the window and over to Wilson. "Do you know what kind of enemy he's made of me?"
[04:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not really. But I've got an imagination."
[04:56] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That's dangerous as hell for a man in your position."
[04:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I've developed some safeguards."
[04:57] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Maybe you have. Maybe you could kill me right now."
[04:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts. "Not that kind of safeguard. You have to drive home, right?"
[04:58] <03Crion> 4He inclines his chin towards the front of the cab. "Before my claws kill her. But I doubt it. And that doubt?"
[04:58] <03Crion> "That doubt is supposed to keep me civilized."
[04:59] <03Crion> "All the people that rely on me now, they're my weaknesses."
[04:59] <03Crion> "So I smile. And officially speaking, Donald Bren's childer are allowed in Laguna."
[04:59] <03Crion> "But they know, and I know."
[05:00] <03Crion> "And there we are."
[05:00] <03Crion> "I can walk if I have to."
[05:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson kicks the fridge open and comes out with a pocket-sized bottle of bourbon. "Civilized is just another word for something left to lose."
[05:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You drink?"
[05:00] <03Crion> "Always."
[05:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson offers him the bottle.
[05:01] <03Crion> 4If there aren't glasses available, Cavanaugh will just take a swig.
[05:01] <03Crion> 4Then he'll hand it off.
[05:01] <03Crion> "I'd never actually kill your driver. I was just making a point."
[05:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's not quite indulgent enough to have a whole bar back here, so yeah it's just the bottle. "Even if you did, it'd be me that killed her. I put her there. Anything that happens to her is on me."
[05:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To weakness." 10He drinks.
[05:03] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I won't toast to that in general. Just my own."
[05:03] <03Crion> 4Cav will take a second drink.
[05:04] <03Crion> "You disappeared earlier tonight."
[05:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Fine by me." 10Wilson runs a hand over his scalp. "Yeah."
[05:04] <03Crion> "So did Bailey."
[05:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Like I said. The quiet box wasn't very quiet."
[05:04] <03Crion> "I know because I had to talk to his wife."
[05:04] <03Crion> "Mmmm."
[05:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I was just trying to ditch the other new baron. You met Valentine?"
[05:05] <03Crion> "No?"
[05:05] <03Crion> "...How hot is she."
[05:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The new Baron Anaheim. Defector out of the Bay. Some kind of tech career." 10He looks up at Cav. "Hot enough to act."
[05:07] <03Crion> 4He sighs. "Frizzy hair."
[05:08] <03Crion> "I haven't met her."
[05:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah. I introduced her to Foster. You must know Foster, she lives down in your neck of the woods. I figured they could keep each other occupied."
[05:08] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh laughs. "Yes, I know Leisurely Foster. Jesus Christ."
[05:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mm?"
[05:09] <03Crion> "But Baron Anaheim, I don't know. She was very interested in me, though."
[05:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ah. I was afraid of that."
[05:09] <03Crion> 4Cav: "'Mm' what?"
[05:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "See if you're on Bren's radar... that means you're on Murray's radar."
[05:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Valentine's one of Helena's people."
[05:09] <03Crion> 4Cav: "No shit?"
[05:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "She's not a good one."
[05:10] <03Crion> "Because she fucking said as much ninety minutes ago."
[05:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Who did?"
[05:11] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Baron Anaheim. After checking out my iPhone."
[05:11] <03Crion> "Sound carries."
[05:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson leans back. "She's green. Paranoid in the wrong ways. On the ride back up from Bressi she was talking my ear off about secure text messages."
[05:12] <03Crion> "No such thing."
[05:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's what I said. Infosec's an aesthetic. But you try telling these people out of Palo Alto anygoddamnthing."
[05:15] <03Crion> 4Cav waves a hand. "She's fine. Besides, Palo Alto isn't the problem."
[05:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What's the problem?"
[05:16] <03Crion> 4Cav pauses. Then: "Ventura."
[05:17] <03Crion> 4This is, admittedly, a calculated risk.
[05:17] <03Crion> 4And not a particularly good one.
[05:17] <03Crion> 4But you have to make progress sometime.
[05:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You think there's something up with the blood banks?"
[05:18] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs.
[05:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Besides the obvious, I mean."
[05:18] <03Crion> 4Cav: "How many vampires get blood each week in this court?"
[05:18] <03Crion> "Two hundred? Three hundred?"
[05:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Lot of pints."
[05:19] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Between 1400 and 2100 pints per week. In fact."
[05:19] <03Crion> "Now, they tell us, that's all stolen from the Red Cross."
[05:19] <03Crion> "I'd believe that, three factors lower."
[05:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's what, 250 whole people a day? Yeah, there's something they're not saying."
[05:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "250 a week, sorry. 35 a day."
[05:21] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You know New York used to have a program like this? Back in the late 70s. Early 80s."
[05:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Back before they made murder illegal, you mean."
[05:21] <03Crion> "And what they'd do is this: they'd go down to, you know. Colombia. San Salvador. Places where we were fucking up everyone's shit. And they'd say: we can give you a new life."
[05:22] <03Crion> "They were lying, of course, but they'd argue they were telling the truth."
[05:22] <03Crion> "They packed these people into cargo containers and put them on these freight haulers, these big motherfuckers."
[05:22] <03Crion> "And they brought them up the coast, in sight of New York. Real Ellis Island shit."
[05:23] <03Crion> "And there, that's when they gutted these people, put their blood on ice, and distributed it to the Reagan fiends and cocaine mobsters all across the city, regular as could be."
[05:24] <03Crion> 4Cav leans forward. "But you see, the difference is: that court never lied about it."
[05:24] <03Crion> "They reveled in it."
[05:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You got leads?"
[05:25] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You know what I am, right?"
[05:25] <03Crion> "My bloodline."
[05:25] <03Crion> "I was sold to this place."
[05:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Bailey mentioned that he bought you. Didn't mention off who."
[05:26] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs. "He bought me off my sires."
[05:26] <03Crion> "So, okay."
[05:27] <03Crion> "In 1857, the United States of America still had not fully settled the contents of its borders. It was preoccupied with other things."
[05:27] <03Crion> "A war, maybe."
[05:27] <03Crion> "The aftermath, maybe."
[05:28] <03Crion> "The progenitors of my bloodline made their way across the harshness of America, literally to this same precise city. And as they did, they encountered, well."
[05:28] <03Crion> "Werewolves. Other vampires. Hunters."
[05:28] <03Crion> "The same as you might crossing these days."
[05:29] <03Crion> "So my progenitors made a choice, over a long, long period of time. They embraced the humans they traveled with, rather than Embracing them, if you catch my drift."
[05:30] <03Crion> "And out of that, the Shepherd bloodline came to be."
[05:30] <03Crion> "We learned, back then, how to defned the things we cared about."
[05:30] <03Crion> "Even if we thought the individuals we were defending were stupid as hell."
[05:31] <03Crion> 4Cav pauses. "I say 'we.'"
[05:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The bloodline with which you're formally affiliated."
[05:31] <03Crion> "I think, at our best, 'we' is the right word to use."
[05:31] <03Crion> "And I know how to use it."
[05:32] <03Crion> "But the rub is this: I'm not the only Shepherd who was deployed to Los Angeles these last eight months."
[05:32] <03Crion> "And, well."
[05:32] <03Crion> "I didn't get to speak to the other guy before he left."
[05:33] <03Crion> 4Wilson's not particularly trustworthy, or reassuring, or a possible method of entry into the random bullshit of this court.
[05:33] <03Crion> 4He is, however, a procedural lever. And everything Cavanaugh's said so far tonight is definitely known to the people who bought him.
[05:34] <03Crion> 4So why not at least put on the wide-eyed face, and try to make a friend in the process?
[05:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "So there's your lead."
[05:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Have you heard from the other Shepherds since?"
[05:39] <03Crion> 4Cav grimaces. "Maybe so, maybe not."
[05:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "So from what I've been hearing, Bailey's main worry is that you're pissing people off he needs under wraps. Some of that's your people and some of that's people who are pissed he brought you in. Some of that's bound to be Burne and Bren but who knows who else. Most of us are so tangled up you've got an in to piss off basically anybody by doing basically anything if you pick 
[05:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> the wrong day."
[05:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Rosa's the one whose problem it'd formally be if you were poking around."
[05:45] <03Crion> 4Cav is silent for a minute. Then: "She was hot in that tux."
[05:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's a good look for her."
[05:47] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But the problem here is this."
[05:47] <03Crion> "I only care about what I have to care about. By assignment. Because everything else is, well. Just an idea."
[05:47] <03Crion> "Structure, and stricture."
[05:48] <03Crion> "So I guess you could say that I don't really give a fuck, unless you've got a bureaucratic incentive in your pocket."
[05:49] <03Crion> 4He leans forward. "And the Prince knows that."
[05:49] <03Crion> "Because the Prince won't stay out of my fucking mind."
[05:49] <03Crion> "So, well."
[05:50] <03Crion> "What do the Mexicans call it when a Mexican standoff gets truly, regrettably stupid?"
[05:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "An American standoff."
[05:50] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs. "May we live in interesting times."
[05:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You see Trump's gonna clinch the nomination."
[05:51] <03Crion> 4Cav: "He's going to win, too."
[05:51] <03Crion> "And he's not going to spend jackshit on ads."
[05:51] <03Crion> "That's what my people care about; the ads."
[05:52] <03Crion> "You could shoot them in the knee and if an ad agency promised them two shoulders, they'd thank you for it."
[05:52] <03Crion> "Fucking idiots."
[05:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What a crock of shit we all turned out to be."
[05:54] <03Crion> 4Cav looks over at Wilson. "You're probably less responsible than me."
[05:55] <03Crion> "Not gonna judge."
[05:55] <03Crion> "Well, maybe a little bit."
[05:55] <03Crion> "But you've been around for awhile?"
[05:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Since the 60s."
[05:55] <03Crion> "Well shit."
[05:55] <03Crion> "We can't even blame you for Reagan."
[05:55] <03Crion> "Demented old fuck."
[05:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Hey, I had a SAG card. Hating Reagan's a union requirement."
[05:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Before he went flyblown he was still a sleazy fucking traitor."
[05:57] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs. "Better than how I came up."
[05:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wall Street?"
[05:58] <03Crion> "Wall Street is ten blocks long and twenty blocks wide. That street consumes lower Manhattan. And yes. That's where I came from."
[05:58] <03Crion> "I haven't mentioned I'm an idiot yet, but you know I'm Gangrel."?
[05:58] <03Crion> -?
[05:59] <03Crion> "But before I was this, I was that."
[05:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You actually did mention that."
[05:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well."
[05:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Beats working, I guess."
[05:59] <03Crion> "I used to remember all kinds of insane, damaging things."
[06:00] <03Crion> "So it's not like no good has come of this."
[06:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I hear you."
[06:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Like I said I've been here fifty years, give or take."
[06:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And I have an extremely good memory."
[06:00] <03Crion> "Give or take what?"|
[06:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Am I really 'here' if I don't leave my home for five years? 1981 to 1986. I think a lot of people thought I was in torpor."
[06:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But I've always been a good soldier, and eventually Bailey stuck me in a barony just to make me get out of the house."
[06:02] <03Crion> "Did you hurt anyone? From 1981 to 1986."
[06:03] <03Crion> 4He leaves out that he was born in 1985.
[06:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I kept a ghoul. Mostly fed off the kids who couried scripts up to my house. They came every day so I never needed more than a nip."
[06:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Oh, and I greenlit Crocodile Dundee."
[06:05] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, I'm sure their parents didn't notice."
[06:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So I've got that on my conscience."
[06:05] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That's probably fine."
[06:06] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You ever regret those years?"
[06:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sometimes. Sometimes they're the only years I don't regret."
[06:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mostly I regret 'em all though."
[06:07] <03Crion> "Yeah."
[06:07] <03Crion> 4Cav sighs. "Yeah, that's probably going to be a theme."
[06:08] <03Crion> "To business: there's some shit in Laguna Beach that involves a Deacon and Cosmo Morgan that I have to deal with."
[06:08] <03Crion> "You're supposed to spy on me."
[06:08] <03Crion> "You've also got at least some minor fucking pull with our mutual friend and lord."
[06:09] <03Crion> 4Cav looks over: "You should know I'd kill Cosmo Morgan sooner than look at him. But maybe I'm not allowed to, this time."
[06:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah."
[06:10] <03Crion> "And maybe Zealous Morse decided to give the entire Sanctum open season on my territory."
[06:11] <03Crion> "So maybe it would be good if I had someone from the hierarchy at least standing around watching what goes down."
[06:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Do you know Sauer?"
[06:11] <03Crion> "You fulfill what you have to fulfill, and you do it without having to either fight me or play pretend."
[06:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The little kid Presbyter. The professor."
[06:12] <03Crion> 4Cav just stares back blanktly. "The little kid."
[06:12] <03Crion> "Jesus Christ--"
[06:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah."
[06:13] <03Crion> "No. No, I don't know the fucking, tween--"
[06:13] <03Crion> "Tell me she's at least a tween."
[06:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah, definitely. Junior high at least."
[06:14] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Great. Great. Why do you want to know if I know Sauer."
[06:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Anyway, I've been meaning to find some ways to help her out too. And I know she's friends with Vincent, whose problem all this shit is in addition to yours. Maybe I can be her observer, or otherwise volunteer on behalf of the Sanctum, instead of being there watching your back. That way I'm putting pressure on Morgan from a direction he can't push back in, I'm boosting the saner half 
[06:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> of the Episcopate, and nobody needs to know you and I are working together."
[06:17] <03Crion> 4Cav pauses. "That makes sense."
[06:17] <03Crion> "He'll still know."
[06:17] <03Crion> "But that makes sense."
[06:18] <03Crion> 4Cav leans back in his seat. "Perhaps the right thing to do is just, not care what he thinks."
[06:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's Wilson's turn to look out the window. "There's a lot of reasons Bailey'd tag me for this job, and all of them make at least a little sense. Whatever the Prince is, he's not stupid."
[06:19] <03Crion> "I wish he was."
[06:19] <03Crion> "Then I'd just be dead."
[06:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But the main one? The obvious one? It's that I've got nothing better to do. I don't really have a stake in any of this. I've put in a lot of work to keep myself from having stakes in any of this."
[06:20] <03Crion> 4Cav: "...Does your driver know that?"
[06:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Only reason I'm out here tonight is because they thought I needed a night out. My driver and my secretary. They know exactly how little I care about anything that's not keeping them safe and keeping me left alone."
[06:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You ever see Barton Fink? 'They pay me back with pity, the basest coin there is.'"
[06:43] <03Crion> 4He hasn't, but he thinks he gets the idea. "There's baser."
[06:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah."
[06:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Anyway, my point is, the one thing everyone can count on is I don't have any particular reason to fuck anybody over."
[06:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're almost back at the theatre."
[06:45] <03Crion> "Yeah." 4Cav looks out the window. "You sure about that?"
[06:45] <03Crion> "Are they sure about that?"
[06:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They're probably surer than I am."
[06:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But that's just because certainty and I aren't on speaking terms."
[06:46] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That's fair."
[06:47] <03Crion> "I just think everybody's angry about something."
[06:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh, I think that's absolutely true."
[06:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But for me, I've run out of other people to be mad at."
[06:48] <03Crion> 4Cav's hand is resting on the door lever. "That's good. They tell me that's when you're closest to God."
[06:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You a religious man?"
[06:48] <03Crion> "No."
[06:49] <03Crion> "But I loved one, once."
[06:49] <03Crion> "Anyway."
[06:49] <03Crion> "I can walk from here."
[06:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Alright. You got a card?"
[06:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson produces one of his, a copy of the one KJ got. WILSON FROST, SENIOR VP FOR DEVELOPMENT, PARAMOUNT PICTURES 14A Viacom Company10.
[06:51] <03Crion> 4It appears easily out of his hand. Still lists him as part of the OS&C, whatever that is.
[06:52] <03Crion> 4Cav glances at it before pocketing it. A slight smirk tracks across his face.
[06:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's my business line. You'll get Nora if you call." 10A woman gets into the front passenger seat as Cav gets out of the back.
[06:53] <03Crion> 4Out into the rain. It doesn't seem to bother Cavanaugh. "Right."
[06:53] <03Crion> "Good night, Hollywood."
[06:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ha." 10It's a dry laugh, lacking for energy but not mirth.
[06:55] <03Crion> 4Cav stands out in the rain until the other car has pulled away down the street.
[06:55] <03Crion> 4Just feeling it on his body; his face.
[06:55] <03Crion> 4Eventually he heads back to the car service for his keys. Eventually he goes home.
[06:56] <03Crion> 4And then, it's time to plan.

[08:40] <03trenchfoot_>  
[08:43] <03trenchfoot_> 6The conversation takes a lighter turn after that, and Tatsuya spends a while talking with Eikichi as they drink. It's good to hang out again. As himself, not as the other self that he also is - that got complicated. Anyway. After a while, he says his goodbyes and makes his way back towards his room, a little unsteady on his feet and a nearly-empty bottle of "fire ball" in his pocket.
[08:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> Someone's coming out of Eikichi's room and almost bumps into Tatsuya!
[08:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's Sondok.
[08:45] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Oof- hey!" 6He steps out of her way, then takes another step to steady himself. "Watcher - Sondok?"
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> Her eyes widen and then narrow, leaving her back at her resting face. "Are you ill?"
[08:48] <03trenchfoot_> "What're you doin' in - nah, nah, just been drinking a bit. Talking. And drinking. Prob'ly shoulda stopped a bit ago, but whoopsy~!" 6He focuses in on the demon. "What were you doin' in there?"
[08:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Security. You need water."
[08:50] <03trenchfoot_> 6He nods agreeably. "Yeah. That sounds good. Security, and the water too."
[08:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok puts a steadying claw on Tatsuya's shoulder and marches him firmly to the lounge, where there are barrels of fresh rainwater.
[08:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's only just dark. How long have you been drinking?"
[08:56] <03trenchfoot_> 6He'll grab a glass and start sipping at the water, sitting on top of one of the barrels. "Daydrinking is fun." 6He counts off on his fingertips. "Four, five? I shoulda brought some water out with me, I'll drink anything too fast when I'm nervous." 6He refills his glass.
[09:00] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "...what's up with you 'n thieves?"
[09:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "What?"
[09:01] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Most emotion I ever heard out of you was when you called me 'thief'. Second most was when you called Ying 'thief'. So. What's up with that?"
[09:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "How long have you been a thief?"
[09:03] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "You counting pickpocketing or just breakin' and entering?"
[09:03] <03trenchfoot_> "Some people don't but I figure it's all the same before the judge."
[09:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Theft is theft."
[09:04] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "So since I was like, four I guess?"
[09:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So you know perfectly well why I don't like thieves."
[09:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's the same reason nobody likes thieves."
[09:06] <03Crion_> 4'You're only in trouble if you get caught.'
[09:07] <03trenchfoot_> 6He shrugs. "Not sayin' anyone's in love with the concept. Not even other thieves. But for you, it brings out some, some extra vi-tri-ol." 6He takes his time pronouncing that last word.
[09:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok makes a face at the word 'vitriol'. "What's that to you?"
[09:15] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "It's like some kind of extra special bonus hatred, I think. I made Eikichi explain it to me a long time ago. I dunno, I'm just curious, people have their reasons for stuff, and I guess - huh." 6He moves to get some kind of snack food. The water needs something to go with it, after all. "I guess it bothered me a little. Reminded me of old times."
[09:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Have you ever made anything?"
[09:19] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "You too, huh? Ying left me a note saying I need a hobby. She wants to make clothing 'n shit."
[09:23] <03trenchfoot_> "Oh, right, and the glib answer is 'mistakes,' but not really. Not yet anyway."
[09:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "It enriches you."
[09:24] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Enriches how? Coupla meanings for that word."
[09:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To invest your passion and wits into base matter, to work until you have this thing, that you've made, that's yours. Yours to keep. Yours to give. Yours. We make things amuse ourselves, to better ourselves, to comfort ourselves. We work to get things because we want them. We hold them dear like memories, we pass them from parent to child like hard-won wisdom."
[09:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What we have is a part of what we are."
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To take... is violence."
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To do violence for profit is base."
[09:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ying would enrich herself in part because you have debased yourself to violence."
[09:43] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya's quiet as he takes a sip of water, and thinks. Then, he speaks. "I used to think about what I would've done if I had, you know. Parents. Grown up in a family of carpenters, or blacksmiths. Learned the family trade." 6Another sip. "Seemed like it would've been nice, but boring. I don't think I would've made it. Maybe that's just who I am. Debaser."
[09:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sit up straight. You'll hurt your back slouching like that."
[09:45] <03trenchfoot_> 6He does so. "Yes ma'am."
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Are you afraid of me?"
[09:51] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Only in the general sense of being a disappointment. Havin' someone look at you and just be mad. Whoops, think I've arrived at the melancholy stage of drunk."
[10:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "You have nothing to fear from me."
[10:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What you do out of my sight isn't my problem. And I assume you wouldn't steal from your friends."
[10:04] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Ying watched Eikichi start off some kind of summoning, used a diviner's deck. Reminded me of a dumb joke I used to tell. Girl, are you the Unconquered Sun arcana? Because I'm feeling extremely judged right now."
[10:04] <03trenchfoot_> 6He chuckles wheezily. "So bad."
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "Tell that one to a lot of girls?"
[10:07] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Me and one of my street rat friends were coming up with anti-pickup lines one day. Same format but the opposite idea. Kei. I think he's dead now."
[10:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Where did you grow up?"
[10:11] <03trenchfoot_> "Nexus. We're heading back home! Woo."
[10:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're from Nexus?"
[10:12] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Yep."
[10:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You don't sound excited to go home."
[10:15] <03trenchfoot_> 6He shrugs. "Not much for me there. No family. I can see who's still alive from where I used to roam, but I'd almost rather live in ignorance. The last time I was in Nexus I was getting chased out. Might still be technically wanted."
[10:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "You could convince them to go somewhere else."
[10:18] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Hm?"
[10:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You don't have to go to Nexus. You're weeks away and you have a vessel that can go to any point in Creation."
[10:22] <03trenchfoot_> 6He shakes his head. "It's important to me that I go back. See it from - see it as someone who's not scraping to survive. Take a look at what might've been. And I do want to find out what happened to the rest of the crew. Maybe help 'em out, if I can. I'm just worried I won't like what I find."
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Why?"
[10:24] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Why's it important to me to go back, or why won't I like what I find?"
[10:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Why go back somewhere that has nothing for you? What are you going to prove?"
[10:27] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I get to prove that I made it. Survived, thrived." 6He sings in a slightly off key warble, "Click your heels, count to three~ I bet you never expected me, a little worse for wear, practically walking on air."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But to who?"
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "All the people who you'd care to know that already know."
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Because they're here."
[10:32] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Maybe. That's a more healthy way of looking at it, anyway."
[10:33] <03trenchfoot_> "You've never wanted to show up to someone you hated, let them find out how far you've come?"
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I think this is the violence we do to ourselves by theft."
[10:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It teaches us to want things that aren't ours to have."
[10:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The smith's sword. The prince's gold. The rebel's heart."
[10:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Forgiveness from our enemies. Absolution of our past."
[10:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Valor."
[10:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We feel that we're owed these things, and then we feel that we lack them."
[10:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And that lack hurts."
[10:41] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "...it does."
[10:44] <03trenchfoot_> "I think... I think I'll let Ying do most of the talking, while we're there. I'll check in on old friends, pay respects, but maybe it's best if I don't - settle accounts."
[10:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok's been wiping down the bar, looking for something to do with her hands to quell her nervous tapping. She's almost at the opposite end of it from Tatsuya when she says, "My daughter lives in Nexus."
[10:48] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya blinks slowly in surprise, but a memory drifts out from the fog to quell it. "She - she does?"
[10:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "Since her father died."
[10:51] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Do you want to see her?"
[10:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't have the right."
[10:51] <03trenchfoot_> "That's not what I asked."
[10:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To want things that aren't ours to have is harm. Harm against others and harm against ourselves."
[10:55] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Why isn't it yours to have?"
[10:56] <03trenchfoot_> "She's your daughter."
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok: "She's lived half her life since I saw her last. And she lived most of the first half without knowing who her mother was. It's unreasonable to show up now, whatever her life is like, and make demands of her attention and time. I don't have the right. I wasn't there when she needed me."
[11:06] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "It's never too late. I won't press you, but... I never had the chance, and I would have jumped at one. It's not just- it's not only your decision to make." 6He leans back on the barrels. "I don't know your life. Or your daughter's. But... make sure when you're punishing yourself for your past, it's only hurting you."
[11:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well. If she wants to see me, she'll be able to find me."
[11:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's not like you'll all be keeping a low profile."
[11:09] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I could drop by. Or Ying could. I don't know."
[11:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You want to do something nice for me?"
[11:13] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Yes?"
[11:14] <03trenchfoot_> 6Was that a trick? Oh jeez.
[11:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Get your friend to treat Usagi with a little more respect."
[11:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "She thinks she's not allowed up here."
[11:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That she's not wanted."
[11:18] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "She's - god damn it, Eikichi. I'll talk to him next chance I get."
[11:19] <03trenchfoot_> "Maybe fetch him from outside. I think he's still out there."
[11:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Still?!"
[11:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> Sondok glowers, and starts striding off. "If he's not already dead of exposure I'm going to kill him..."
[11:22] <03trenchfoot_> "I think so? Hells, but I'm sober enough to drag him back in here at this point. Hey, wait!" 6He hustles to catch up to Sondok. "I'll come with you."
[11:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She doesn't slow down, but she doesn't need to. They're in lockstep when they find Eikichi scribbing something and shivering under his cloak by the light of a burning fir tree. "Heyyyyyyy," 10he says when he sees Tatsuya. "Thought you were done for thoh."
[11:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then he looks down at the paper and the stone, and not up at Sondok.
[11:26] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I brought you some water. Also I came to drag you back inside, because I'm no longer drunk enough to let you freeze."
[11:26] <03trenchfoot_> "Sondok reminded me. Thanks, Sondok."
[11:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "S'fine. I'm writing a song."
[11:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I just need to whooooah"
[11:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok's picked him up one-handed, paper pen and all, by gathering his cape up like a bindle.
[11:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It looks a bit like she's got him in a sack.
[11:28] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya makes as if to try and help her carry Eikichi, but he decides she's got him. "Okay, I guess I was just moral support on the whole deal. Let's get you some water and have a chat."
[11:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm fiiiiine" 10says Eikichi, his voice muffled by being in a sack.
[11:29] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "You'll be even finer after you get some water in you."
[11:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok lets Tatsuya get Eikichi some water while she goes to get a fresh blanket from his room.
[11:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "...beat up a tax collector..."
[11:34] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "What's the deal with Usagi?"
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "...huh?"
[11:36] <03trenchfoot_> "I talked with Sondok like you suggested. Me, not Ying."
03[11:36] * banana|peels is now known as banana
[11:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Did she kill you?"
[11:37] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Not yet. It was a good talk, I think. She put some things in perspective. So I'm returning a favor." 6He repeats. "What's the deal with Usagi?"
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Tatsuya I love you but that is a REALLY vague question."
[11:40] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I like vague. It lets people confess to stuff you didn't even know they did, if you can pull it off. Anyway. Is she not allowed out of that room?"
[11:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What? Why wouldn't she be?"
[11:42] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Sondok says she thinks she's not allowed up here. Unwanted."
[11:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok comes back in with a blanket and a hot water bottle. "She thinks she's not allowed up on the main decks."
[11:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, that's stupid."
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I must've, I must've told her to leave me alone or something. And she decided it meant I'd banished her."
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Uh huh."
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What did you say?"
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, who remembers?"
[11:44] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I think we can find out on the way down to sort this out."
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh come on-" 10Eikichi whines.
[11:44] <03trenchfoot_> "Also, if I had to guess, Usagi does."

[11:47] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya lifts Eikichi up and begins half-supporting, half dragging him by the shoulder. "Stand up, there you go. Let's get this mess sorted and then we can all take a nice drunk sleep."
[11:48] <03trenchfoot_> "If you're going to hurl, please do so away from me. I just cleaned this."
[11:49] <03dammitwho> 7It's a surprising scene they come across, once they make it belowdecks. Usagi is lying on her back, waggling her little impy legs in the air and giggling as Blossom mercilessly tickles her belly. "Hee hee hee! Oh, hee hee hee hee!" 7gasps the lil' demon.
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm not even that drunk...!" 10Sondok follows a staggering Eikichi and Tatsuya down belowdecks. Usagi's room is beside the makeshift stables where Errant and Ami rest. Eikichi opens the door and sees "Blossom?!"
[11:50] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "..."
[11:50] <03trenchfoot_> "I have several questions."
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok presses her lips together.
[11:52] <03dammitwho> "Oh, hello." 7Blossom levers herself off her knees. "What's all this?"
[11:54] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya drains the last little bit of the "fire ball" he'd been neglecting to sober up. "Wanted to clear up a misunderstanding. Do you, uh." 6There's no way to make this not sound sleazy. "Do you come here often."
[11:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi, obviously drunk: "They want me to tell Usagi she's not imprisoned in her room. Which she's obviously not. I mean can you imagine what I'd do if she just wallowed in her in her filth without doing anything?"
[11:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Usagi hides behind Blossom's legs.
[11:57] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "That doesn't sound like the correct answer to me."
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm JUST SAYING that even if I WERE some kind of monster I'd want her out and about!"
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Which I'm not."
[11:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom crosses her arms and scowls at Eikichi. "Now look, you've scared her! Be nice."
[11:57] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Survey says?" 6He's looking at Sondok and Usagi.
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Usagi: "What about when you said that the next time you see me poking around the essence reactor you'll personally show me the inside of it?"
[11:58] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Eikichi."
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I was obviously joking! Of course I'd never risk damaging the reactor."
[11:59] <03trenchfoot_> "Eikichi."
[12:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Okay okay okay. Look. Usagi. I'm sorry for being rude. Obviously you're as welcome everywhere on the Heavensward as Sondok is."
[12:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Usagi: "So anywhere as long as you're not around?"
[12:01] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "That's a heck of a qualifier."
[12:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, yeah, because that order lasted sooooooo long."
[12:02] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Eikichi."

[12:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "How much have you been drinking?"
[12:07] <03dammitwho> "Oh my gods the peppermint schnapps. It tastes like candy!" 7She turns her scowl on Tatsuya. "How much did you let him have?"
[12:07] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya looks a little guilty. "Think he's had a full bottle of schnapps."
[12:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "He's the size of a 12 year old!"
[12:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Hey!"
[12:08] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "I thought he could hold it!"

[12:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It got cold! Drinking opens up your blood vessels and makes you feel warmer."
[12:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It was like a blanket. A peppermint blanket."
[12:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10In a stage whisper to Blossom: "I started writing a song."
[12:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "D'you remember... d'you remember that time you said 'music is hot-blooded poetry'?"
[12:11] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom nods sternly. "I do remember that."

[12:14] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya nods, satisfied. "The hand clap is an important part of ceremony."
[12:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok looks askance at Blossom. Not that this is her fault, but, you know. It's not like Eikichi's going to be responsible for himself.
[12:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10And Tatsuya's barely any better."
[12:16] <03trenchfoot_> 6Hey! He's like, super good. Suuuuuper good.
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's the best!
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10love you man
[12:17] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya hugs Eikichi, apropos of nothing.
[12:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Usagi hugs Blossom!
[12:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Wonderful. Tatsuya, can you--" 7He's clearly plastered too. "Sondok, can you please put Eikichi to bed and give Tatsuya a small glass of our remaining fruit juice so that Sunlit-Dreaming Ying doesn't have a hangover?"
[12:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Sensible. Come along, boys."
[12:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm not-"
[12:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Shush!"
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi slouches on his way back up to his room, thuogh he's not steady on his feet.
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Usagi, help him up."
[12:21] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Bye~! Don't worry, I've been drinking water for a good while now. My body is a temple."
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Usagi does an elaborate salute, crossing her arms over her chest and folding her hands back so they form a diamond shape with her forearms. "Right away!"

[12:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10After they're gone, Sondok taps Tatsuya on his shoulder. Her face clearly wasn't designed to hold a smile; she looks almost reptilian. "Come on. I'll get you some juice and then you can go to bed too."
[12:27] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Sure. Thanks." 6He looks a little woozy. "Glad you made me drink that water earlier. I'd be way worse off without it."
[12:28] <03trenchfoot_> "And I'm glad you talked with me about Nexus. And thieving. Thanks."
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Don't mention it." 10There's just enough of an edge to Sondok's voice that it's hard to tell if that was a pleasantry or an imperative.
[12:29] <03trenchfoot_> "As you wish," 6he says agreeably.
[12:48] <03Crion_> 4Ir, meanwhile, sits in the dark of the workspace she's converted into a distillery, tending to the furnace beneath the still, staring into the flame, her old, beat-up six-string across her lap, half a bottle of whiskey next to her on the floor, sometimes strumming, sometimes humming, but mostly silent; mostly just staring into that flame, burning in the darkness, a candle dreaming of 
[12:48] <03Crion_> 4the Sun.
[12:48] <03Crion_> 4Eventually, she sleeps.

[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12As Creation's mountains go, the peaks of the Hedgehog aren't that impressive in terms of size or chain length. Oh, a few of them are up there, but most of them cluster well below the point of dangerously thinning air and cloud cover that serves climbers as fog, and not a one of them floats or spews lava. What's more notable is the depth and diversity of the ravines and hollows between 
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12the mountains, some of which are idyllically grassy valleys but many more of which are mist-choked bogs or dark chasms with no apparent bottom.
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12On the west, like a creeping mold, a network of encampments and cartrails and mine entrances denote the beginnings of House Cathak's mining operations. To the east, the Hedgehog slopes down into scrubland and savannah, neither of which are particularly bountiful now in the approach of winter. Somewhere above, you're told, live the fae - and though the Heavensward is only parked around 
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12the north edge of the whole area, keen observers who wander the deck at sunrise or noon might detect a strangely vibrant golden-pink cast to the southern sky.
[09:52] <03Crion_> 4The Heavensward could actally do a pretty comprehensive survey of the range if they wanted to, but unless someone has insisted Ir's kept the ship tightly moored while she tries to buff out some of the scratches left by the wind dragon.
[09:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wern and Freda have offered to lead you to their 'holler' (it took a few tries before you understood what they meant) if you so choose, although it sounds like it's deep enough between two mountains that you won't be able to just park the Heavensward on top of it. Otherwise, they'll have simply taken off, wildly grateful but still uneasy in your presence.
[09:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12You've been warned neither to climb too high nor wander too deep - monsters sometimes rise from the bogs.
[09:55] <03Crion_> 4Ir's not opposed on checking in on them, or at least going on an afternoon visit to get an impression of the area. She'd go by horse rather than ship, though.
[09:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi isn't particularly worried about the trek, since of course he can fly.
[09:57] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's interested. Besides, there was a saying back in Nexus, the farther out jobs were the most rewarding. There was a rhyming bit to it, though it escapes him.
[10:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12So who's to where?
[10:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12And on what?
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's going to put a surprised Sondok in the Stormwind Rider with him and go aloft looking for the rakshastan.
[10:08] <03Crion_> 4Ir will head out to the vill -- the, uh, holler, and she'll do it with Wern and Freda in tow so they don't get themselves into anymore trouble.
[10:13] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is up before anyone else except perhaps Sondok. Before Eikichi leaves, she'll quietly take Sondok aside and ask her, if it looks like Eikichi's getting into more trouble than he can handle at the rakshastan, to toss him in the Stormwind Rider and take them both back to the Heavensward.
[10:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok nods and puts a claw on Blossom's shoulder, and then squeezes a little too hard for it to be comforting.
[10:17] <03dammitwho> 7But before all that, the Squared Circle and their guests probably wake to Blossom cheerfully singing a tongue-twister song Eikichi remembers from back home: "Pasiap is a dragon with a 'Pa' / If he pa-ly crosses the Pa-nkara Pass / He may get prickly and puffy from all the pa-li, but / Now he got it, he hits like an avalanche!"
[10:17] <03Crion_> 4Ir will be up soon after, yawning real loudly as she wanders out of the workspace with the still and puts the empty bottle of whiskey in the bin for reuse later, then stows her old six-string behind the bar. Then she's firing up their ranges and clearing space on their countertops; their guests are leaving today, and she plans on sending them home with something to remember the 
[10:17] <03Crion_> 4Heavensward by. The good news is, she's got all the ingredients on hand for Pneuman's Famous Porksauce.
[10:18] <03Crion_> 4Time to make some brisket.
[10:18] <03dammitwho> "Daana'd is a dragon with a 'Da' / if she da-ly crosses the Da-nkara Pass / She may get dejected and defiant from all the da-li, but / Now she got it, she hits like a torrent!"
[10:19] <03dammitwho> "Unconsciously, unintentionally, you learn / this song by heart, it's unavoidable / When that happens, sing and let someone else hear it / and you will forget it quickly..."
[10:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Blossom? Singing? Eikichi rushes out in his pajamas. What's she doing?
[10:22] <03Crion_> 4He may or may not be distracted by the insanely good smells coming from the kitchen right about now.
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Aaaaaa
[10:23] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's in the kitchen only briefly, but once their guests announce their intentions, and he gets a real good look at 'em, he announces that he'll be taking a day off, and will be retiring to his room early.
[10:24] <03dammitwho> 7She's sorting and storing wild fruits, vegetables, berries, what looks like meat from small animals... evidently she went out foraging bright and early and came back with a decent bounty.
03[10:25] * banana|peels is now known as banana
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's really hard for Wern to believe that Blossom was able to find that many eggs and edible mushrooms and whatnot in such a small area and in so short a timespan, but, well, you are all demons.
[10:28] <03Crion_> 4This brisket is actually going so well that her small test batch is already done, so she's turned it into breakfast (along with some hashed and sauteed tubers) and brings a plate around to everyone after the real stuff goes into the oven. The good news about this stuff is it reheats so well as long as you get the sauce right that it's pretty perfect for preparing on the ship and then 
[10:28] <03Crion_> 4taking out there, and it doesn't take anything fancy to make, tools-wise.
[10:28] <03trenchfoot> 13We super aren't! Wow, I thought we had this already proven!
[10:31] <03dammitwho> 7Is Eikichi watching Blossom openly, or hiding, or heading to the galley...?
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's not hiding. He's just standing there with a big goofy grin on his face.
[10:32] <03dammitwho> "Eikichi! You're finally up!"
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...did you sleep?"
[10:34] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Of course! And then I woke up again, and have been getting many things accomplished. I just took Wern out foraging for an hour or so while Ir made breakfast."
[10:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12You've proven you're not faeries! Demons can lie.
[10:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, so can the fae, but in particular demons can swear and not mean it.
[10:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi leans in to kiss her on the cheek. "Oh! That reminds me, I was going to put together some first aid kits for them."
[10:43] <03trenchfoot> 13It's not too much longer when Sunlit-Dreaming Ying makes her way down to breakfast and begins chomping away. She gives the appropriate thank-yous to the chefs, but otherwise just mostly seems really hungry.
[10:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A couple of hours later he sees them off with small travel packs with a white cloth pinned to them, a red cross painted on each cloth with a calligraphy brush. After that Eikichi's about ready to take Sondok up to look for the rakshastan with Sondok, via the Stormwind Rider.
[10:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Everyone headin' out, then? Or at least, everyone who's headin' out, headin' out?
[10:46] <03Crion_> 4Once Ir's got the brisket packed up in saddlebags and has done the dishes, yeah. 
[10:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom does ask Ir and Ying to hold up a bit, so she can spend a few hours drawing a circle in the soft dirt, improvising scriptures commanding the Essence of the earth to rise up and offer its service, chanting in Old Realm, and so on.
[10:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12What's Blossom calling forth and what's she tellin' it to do?
[10:48] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying agrees! She spends most of the time meditating, trying to draw something out, or checking around the area for discarded bows. She really needs to pick one of those up for emergencies.
[10:49] <03dammitwho> 7An earth elemental, one of the least variety - she's going to ask it to find and bring back a deposit of native copper. Not much, just a few dozen ponzes worth.
[10:50] <03dammitwho> 7Soon enough, a lil' fellow that looks like a Xuanwu turtle made of rough dirt coalesces out of the ambient Essence of the area.
[10:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Aww.
[10:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Is it gonna stick around for the year, or is it free to return to the earth once it's accomplished its task?
[10:53] <03Crion_> 4Ir's got time. She'll discuss the nitty-gritty of how the people in the holler salt their meat with Wern and Freda to pass the time, and offer some tips if she thinks they need them.
[10:53] <03dammitwho> 7It's free to disperse into Essence flow or continue to exist as an independently-willed being on its own once it's finished that.
[10:55] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying listens to Ir and the gang talk. She's got to learn more advanced cooking techniques than just winging it and hoping for the best, after all.
[10:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12It chirps at you, then, and leaps gracefully into the air before burrowing straight into the ground at Blossom's feet. Whee!
[10:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Ha! I was worried that would be hard."
[10:57] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "It wasn't?"
[10:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12So at this point it's like, Usagi holding down the fort, right?

[11:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Seems reasonable.
[11:05] <03Crion_> 4Famous last words.
[11:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying gives both Eikichi and Sondok a hug before she leaves. "Stay safe, both of you," 13she tells them, seriously. "Or else I'll haunt you. I'll find a way to do it."
[11:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It'll be fine. I'll bring everyone back a present."
[11:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Don't eat anything!"
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, Eikichi has quite a trip ahead of him, because while the Stormwind Rider is incredibly fast, it doesn't actually fly that high. Unless the rakshastan the sorcerer seeks is a mere two or four stories off the ground, he won't be able to just sail on up there on his own; his best bet is to follow the exact opposite of Wern and Freda's advice, skating along the highest mountains 
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12he can find and looking for trouble at their peaks. He'll probably want to stay in the center of the Hedgehog, too, maybe leaning eastwards, since you'd assume the Cathak are handling things themselves somehow.
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Yeah. Eikichi assumes that there must be some way to access the rakshastan without flying directly up to it.
[11:07] <03Crion_> 4Ir: "A cool gift for me would be no more shitheads from a past life."
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, the rest of the circle, and the circle's two guests, have a much glamorous trip ahead of them. They go hiking off into the brush, taking a series of circuitous paths around the mountains that prevent them from drifting either too high or too low. Lots of sun-dappled fallen leaves, dry branches crunching underfoot, and glimpses of probably-dangerous wild fauna out of the 
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12corners of the eye await them.
[11:08] <03Crion_> 4Can Errant and Ami manage it?
[11:09] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "That's not a present! That's a past!"
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ami, yes, since Ami seems to not notice the grade of the slope she's on and can just walk right on top of the fallen leaves that occasionally obscure dangerous pits in the ground or whatever. Errant will need some skilled handling.
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12As the solars travel, they're given to rack their brains and organize their thoughts with regards to the fae. I'm not sure if Blossom and Eikichi have read the exact same scrolls, but they're largely appraised of the same information, and are able to educate their allies unless for some reason they choose not to.
[11:11] <03Crion_> 4Wow. Fucked up that no one capable of that is currently riding Errant, with all her awesome brisket.
[11:12] <03Crion_> 4Errant's a good boy and handles the terrain damn well. Helps that Ir gets the feeling he's taking this bird's agility as something like a challenge.
[11:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12Vulnerability to iron, an appetite for strong emotions or personality traits, a total susceptibility to but irresistible fascination with formal oaths and promises - everyone knows and can confirm that stuff. What's a little harder to get across but, perhaps, more important to understand is the underlying metaphysics of the fae and the raksha, and what that might mean for humans 
[11:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12who'd fight or entreat with them.
[11:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12Fae are 'naturally' immaterial, but in a way not even barely analogous to the way that gods and demons are. It's not that the same creature might either be corporeal or incorporeal - it's that a faerie is by default a bodiless vortex of wyld energy that flatly cannot survive in creation. The creatures most people understand to be fae are what the savants call 'raksha' - individual 
[11:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12wyld-born egoes and intellects that fashion for themselves stories, identities, and even bodies with which they can withstand the rigors of the created world.

[23:28] <03Crion_> 4Clinton Cavanaugh is sweating when he wakes up. It's hot in the mansion's master bedroom; he still has to black out the windows, so there's no ventillation.
[23:29] <03Crion_> 4He'll text Kayleigh, then put on some pants and go check on the girls.
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4Meanwhile he reaches his mind out over the flock in Laguna. Anyone in town yet he should know about?
[23:32] <03Quaker> There is not. While he reaches, he can sense a group of three kindred drive through the periphery of the town, but they’re just using the toll road. 
[23:32] <03Quaker> He’s by himself out here. 
[23:32] <03Crion_> 4Good. The night is young, but good.
01[23:32] <03banana> 6Troubled? Who's dreaming? 
01[23:32] <03banana> 6KJ Valentine puts that off until she wakes up, thesenights.
[23:33] <03tom> 14A man with matted hair slouches over to the sink in the church bathroom, splashes some water on his face.
[23:33] <03Crion_> 4Once he's fed Honey and Shots, played with them a bit, then let them loose into the hill brush, he'll go back inside, shower, and get dressed for dinner. It's date night with Kayleigh, and he's gotten them reservations at...
[23:33] <03tom> 14Just another night in Mission Viejo
01[23:34] <03banana> 6Last night didn't go well. At least she's met another weirdo. Weirdos, in KJ's experience, are good people to know; they tend to be unusually good at unusually specific things.
[23:34] <03Crion_> 4...at somewhere. He can't remember. It's in his phone.
[23:34] <03Crion_> 4It's somewhere nice, though!
01[23:35] <03banana> 6Nice of W-Frost to introduce her to a friendly enemy, not so nice of the guy to vanish later. And was that him walking out with Clinton Cavanaugh at the end of the ballet? Hmm.
01[23:35] <03banana> 6Well, there's a lot to do today.
01[23:35] <03banana> 6Tonight. 
[23:36] <03Quaker> Is there? What’s she doing?

[23:39] <03Crion_> 4He's out the door soon, impeccably dressed and scrolling through his calendar app. Trattoria Impresario, a hot new high-end place that does very traditional Italian cuisine but has gotten its best press for a wonderful, inspired Italian-Mexican fusion menu courtesy of its head chef, a young Mexican woman whose name he absolutely cannot recall.
[23:40] <03tom> 14He's still wearing the same suit he wore to the ballet. Tommy pulls out a chain of paper towels, dabs them with water, and tries to do triage.
01[23:40] <03banana> 6Of course! There's a lot to do every night - read reports, keep up with the troops, donate blood. Take blood donations. Study ('isn't it 2013'? come on.), patrol.. and give Baron Hollywood a call. All this while looking good. Maybe some kind of thicker blouse, in case it rains again. 
01[23:41] <03banana> 6Also: learn to shoot, have these bullets looked into, um.. right, embed an exploit on her Twitter profile. There need to be more hours between sunset and sunrise.

[23:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's up at the crack of dusk. He let the girls take him back to the place in the Hills instead of dropping him off at the office, so he's up sober and showered and in a fresh pressed suit. Maura- no, Nora's out, and Cora's working somewhere else in the house. So he's on the phone in a cavernous rec room - pool table and two TVs and a full bar, just across the hall from the home 
[23:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10theater - waiting for someone from Sauer's office to pick up.
[23:43] <03Quaker> Here’s something: one of her flunkies hands her a well-made card. Baron KJ Valentine - Please allow us to entertain you at our time and expense whenever you find yourself at a loss. Yours warmly, T. Okienka, Baron Modjeska. 
[23:43] <03Quaker> Someone does, quickly. “Yeah, hello-“ It’s Sauer herself. 
01[23:43] <03banana> 6KJ's initial routine is just to head downstairs, out the back of her house across the alley and to the office. One of those small commercial buildings which used to be a Pizza Hut before it was a Kinko's before it was a Papa John's. There's a couple of ghouls and less-haemologically-empowered employees there doing correspondence, taking reports from people in the field. Such as they are, such as it is.
[23:44] <03Quaker> There’s a knock on the basement door. It’s the signal, as it’s been the past few months since he’s been living there, that Soria has left a pile of freshly laundered clothes for him in a wicker basket on the steps past the door. 
[23:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Presbyter Sauer," comes Wilson's voice, slightly crackly through the telephone. "It's Wilson. Is this a bad time?"
01[23:47] <03banana> "Thanks." 6This is interesting. Tess Okienka was a bit less.. vivacious than the rest of Jessie's circle, but she did appreciate films.. KJ will dictate a reply, because this is the 1920s or something and that's how you do it.
[23:48] <03tom> 14Tommy stumbles out the door to catch the departing Soria. 
[23:48] <03tom> "Hey- hey you don't have to, uh-"
[23:49] <03Crion_> 4He picks her up outside her apartment -- a cozy place down the street from the surf shop, up on the third floor. There aren't that many buildings with more than three stories in Laguna. He parks on the curb and gets out, texting her that he's outside, and just leans back against his Lexus and appreciates the gathering night.
[23:49] <03Quaker> The priest turns. “Huh? Oh. Don’t worry about it, Thomas. Just one more chore.” 
[23:49] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Just a busy one. What can I help you with?” 
[23:50] <03Quaker> Soria: “How did the ballet go?” 
01[23:51] <03banana> 6KJ: [Entertainment would be heck of welcome, Baron Modjeska. Could I accept your gracious invitation for some time in the next couple of nights? The weather lends itself ill to the usual jaunts, so sup?]
[23:51] <03tom> "No I mean, come on man, you got better things to do than..." 14He coughs, leans against the doorframe, tries to flatten out his tie. The nosferatu puffs his cheeks, nods. "Pretty good I think. You know this Cav guy? He's really pissed at Cosmo Morgan, so we got that going for us..."
[23:52] <03Crion_> 4He smiles when she steps out the door onto the sidewalk, short blonde hair swept back and still a bit wet from...the shower? The surf? She's wearing a black dress he's seen on her before. He wouldn't forget that. "Hi."
[23:53] <03tom> "He's going to try to do some legal bull-shit to buy us some time to find Sp- Souza."
[23:54] <03Crion_> "Hi," 4says Kayleigh Swanson, smiling back, walking towards him.
[23:54] <03tom> 14He glances back down at the basket. "Really though, you don't gotta- look, as soon as I get some money I'll cover my own costs."
[23:55] <03tom> "I'll get outta your basement A.S.A.P."
[23:55] <03Crion_> 4He straightens up off the car. "You look--" 4She cuts him off with a kiss. She knows. And honestly, Cav's compliments don't have the most variety to them.
[23:55] <03Crion_> 4He opens the passenger-side door for her, walks around to get back behind the wheel, and they're off into the night.
01[23:55] <03banana> 6Anyway. It's a good thing most of the manorial duties are handled because this next part of the job KJ has to do personally. 
01[23:56] <03banana> 6She jaunts(? it sounded better when dictating) back across the street, locks the door, connects to the secure room through various VPNs and starts messing with Metasploit.
[23:59] <03Crion_> 4Instead of music, Kayleigh turns the Lexus's radio -- well, the satellite radio device that Cav's installed -- to KLAA, the radio affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.
[23:59] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Who're they playing?"
[23:59] <03Quaker> Soria shrugs. “It’s my duty to look after you any way I can. If that’s washing your clothes for now, then that’s what it is. What’s next for you, then?” 
[23:59] <03Crion_> 4Kay: "Fucking Rangers, man."
Session Time: Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 2017
[00:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I've been thinking about our meeting last week, and I want to talk about the kind of support I can offer the church at its crossroads. Can we set up a meeting?"
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "They winning?"
[00:02] <03Quaker> Sauer takes a moment to respond. “Let me check my calendar.” He can hear her moving papers around, and muffled talking in the background. Eventually: “I’m a bit pressed for time in the immediate future, Baron, but if it doesn’t inconvenience you, I’m at Presbyter Vincent’s office doing some work. I can meet you here.” 
[00:03] <03Crion_> 4Kay: "The Angels?" 4She laughs. "Nah, they're down 2-1. It's Hamels against Richards tonight, so you know. Ace against ace. It's only the fifth inning, so they could come back."
[00:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Aha! "Presbyter Vincent? Down in Orange County? That's perfect. You have the address for me?"
[00:05] <03tom> "Well," 14he sighs. "Cav's busy tonight so the Sponger issue's tabled till tomorrow. You got any... functions you're leading tonight? Y'know, for the Church."
[00:05] <03Quaker> She gives it. “Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. I’ll be at this number.” 
[00:05] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Now, Richards, he had the great year last year, right? Is he really the ace now?"
[00:06] <03Crion_> 4Kay sighs. "Well, it's either him or Weaver, right? And don't get me wrong, Weaver's great, but. You know. He's getting a little old, maybe."
[00:06] <03Quaker> Soria: “I’m meeting with Deacon Garra. The new housing. Some details he wants me to oversee. Thomas, if I can give you some advice? A lead that I remembered, for Souza.” 
[00:07] <03tom> "Yeah?"
[00:08] <03Crion_> 4Kay: "Look at you, though. Remembering shit about baseball."
[00:08] <03Crion_> 4Cav grins and shrugs. "Well, you know. I try." 4He also checked the roster on his phone while he was waiting for her.
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Thank you very much. I'll be there within the hour, hopefully." 10Next he calls Cora. He could go looking for her, or possibly shout very loudly, but he wasn't raised in a barn. "Cora, dear, bring the car around. I'm going to see some church ladies."
[00:10] <03Crion_> 4They spend the rest of the ride listening to the game and talking baseball (to the best of Cav's ability), and then how her day was (busy, kinda crappy) and how her school's going (undergrad, a couple years late, still a part-time student).
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cora: "Really?"
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yes. What?"
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cora: "Nothing."
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What?"
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cora: "That's two nights in a row."
[00:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Oh will you just go get the damn car. Jesus." 10Shouldn't say that in front of the church ladies.
[00:12] <03Quaker> Soria: “After his home was destroyed, he lived with a cousin in the area. A chef, last name Perez, a restaurant called Trattoria Impresario. He mentioned it a few weeks ago.” 
[00:12] <03Crion_> 4Then they talk about how his school is going. Since Cav's been inducted into the Ordo, his appetite for reading and study found new life -- he's even started adding a library in one of the empty, large rooms in the north wing. And while he didn't technically need a cover story for doing so, he figured he might have one anyway by continuing to pursue something he'd put on hold when 
[00:12] <03Crion_> 4he moved out here: a law degree.
[00:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cora takes Wilson down to the offices of Presbyter Clarabelle Vincent.
01[00:13] <03banana> 6..ok. Unless he's literally using an ancient version of Android, that's not going to do much without an OS version plugged in, but it almost works. Keeping up with tech is a lot harder when it isn't your life. 
01[00:13] <03banana> 6It'd almost give KJ some sympathy for the illiterates and displaced professions, but, get this: she's doing it while also running a vampire barony. Try that in a regulated economy.
[00:14] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "--So right now, I'm sort of looking at my options. Maybe USC Law? Maybe Stanford, but I don't think they do correspondence or online classes."
[00:14] <03tom> 14Tommy whips out his phone and pulls up a map, begins tapping with his thumbs. "How far away are we talking? -Hold on, got it."
01[00:14] <03banana> 6So. Who's the best gossip she knows?
[00:15] <03Crion_> 4Kayleigh's encouraging and attentive, but doesn't press too much about the scheduling. There are some unspoken rules for what they do and don't talk about.
[00:15] <03Crion_> 4Soon, they've arrived. To Cav's relief, he did, in fact, remember to get the reservations like his notes said.
[00:20] <03Quaker> A ghoul comes bearing a phone call for KJ. “For you, Baron.” 
[00:20] <03Quaker> Soria: “Just a tip. Good luck. Call me if you need anything.” 
03[00:20] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-kcb.9ek.200.87.IP)
[00:22] <03Quaker> The offices of Presbyter Vincent are a shabby apartment next to a junior college and an upscale shopping mall. At least it’s gated. Wilson’s Lincoln looks a bit out of place compared to the old Toyotas and Hyundais that inhabit the parking lot. 
[00:22] <03tom> 14Where's the restaurant at?
[00:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It does, so Wilson will tell Cora to take the car and ride around and he'll call her when the meeting's over. How's the weather tonight?
01[00:24] <03banana> 6KJ was just about to call Jessie Campbell.. maybe her luck's turned? "Anaheim here."
[00:24] <03Crion_> 4The appetizers are excellent, and service prompt and knowledgable, and the wine fantastic. They order the jalapeño fettucine with chicken, tomatoes, and black beans while talking about the best Italian food they've ever had. Cav's got a place on the Lower East Side he's stumping for, while Kay says there's a place in Anaheim they have to check out some other night.
[00:24] <03tom> "I will, father. Take care."
[00:25] <03tom> 14That's what you call priests, right? Father? Tommy checks and double-checks the zipcode. Yeah, the coastline- that's Laguna alright. Fuck.
[00:26] <03Quaker> Clear skies and a cold moon. 
[00:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The rain's gone. Nice night for working. Feels good to work. Does someone meet Wilson as he enters or does he gotta call?
[00:29] <03tom> 14Tommy kicks the wicker basket inside, then proceeds out the back to smoke in the stairwell. Doesn't do shit- he can't spare the blood for it- but he's hoping some sort of psycho-somatic whatever will help ease his nerves.
[00:30] <03Quaker> The voice on the other end of KJ’s line sounds around her age. “Baron, this is Santiago Aguilar, Baron Modjeska’s personal secretary. I thought I’d save the ghouls the game of phone tag.” 
[00:31] <03tom> 14Cav's phone vibrates. [Hey do you know about a restaurant called Tratorria Impression]
[00:31] <03tom> [Trattoria Impressario]
[00:31] <03tom> [tommy btw]
01[00:32] <03banana> 6KJ waves the flunky away, then changes it to a thumbs up. Consistently good flunking tonight. 
[00:32] <03tom> 14He manipulates the cigarette with his lips while he taps out a message.
01[00:33] <03banana> "Thoughtful! I'm KJ- what's up with this cool plan for expensive entertainment?"
[00:33] <03Crion_> 4When Cav looks away from his girlfriend to glance down at his phone, he's able, through sheer effort, to keep the smile on his lips.
[00:33] <03Crion_> 4Kay: "...What's up?"
[00:34] <03Crion_> 4He sighs. "The office. A client's bothering one of my guys on his home phone afterhours, saying needs to speak with a manager. I'm sorry babe, I need to take this. It should be quick."
[00:35] <03Quaker> Santiago: “The Baron is still resting from her last night out. But we’d be happy to entertain you tonight. Or at your earliest convenience.” 
[00:35] <03Crion_> "It's fine," 4she says, and she means it. This is far from the first time this has happened, and he's never lying about the phone calls being short.
01[00:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "Oh, you're the 'we' from the card. Yeah, I'd love to come over!" 6If it was a few hours ago she might have declined.. but there aren't any emergencies, and meeting new people is a good idea for all sorts of reasons right now.
[00:36] <03Crion_> 4Cav makes it out onto the sidewalk before the smile slips into a near-fangbaring growl. He reaches out. Is this motherfucker nearby? Is he being watched? Can he feel any vampires, any predators, in the streets of Laguna around him?
[00:37] <03Quaker> Santiago laughs. “Yeah. She hasn’t started using the royal we. Yet. Okay. I’ll send over the address and keep the gate open.” 
[00:38] <03Crion_> 4While he does that, he won't text back -- he'll call.
01[00:40] <03banana> 6KJ: "Nice. My real number's (xxx) xxx-xxxx.. if Modjeska's where I think it is I should be under an hour?" 6Thankfully they're on the right edge of the city, and it's late. Heck, it's always late.
[00:40] <03Quaker> Nobody meets Wilson out in the parking lot. The address they gave, unit 251, is tucked away in the corner of the building. It just looks like a regular apartment building…? 
[00:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There a bell then? Wilson'll call if there's no bell.
[00:41] <03tom> 14The phone starts ringing. "Shit." 14He tosses away the cigarette. "Yeah?"
[00:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "You're playing a very dangerous game with my patience, Deacon."
[00:41] <03tom> "Woah, woah, whoah, what?"
[00:41] <03Crion_> 4Are there any vampires around the restaurant other than Cav?
[00:42] <03Crion_> 4He's using Conestoga, here.
[00:43] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Yeah what’s up” 
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's Wilson."
[00:46] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Did you find the place okay?” 
01[00:46] <03banana> 6Now it's time for KJ's favourite game: 
[00:46] <03Quaker> There aren’t any other vampires in Laguna Beach, let alone the restaurant. 
01[00:47] <03banana> 6Tweet as many times as you can on a long drive, content optional in the case of avoiding accidents.
[00:47] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "How are you doing it? Ghouls? Remote viewing? Are you following her? "
[00:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah, it was on the GPS. How's tricks, Presbyter?" 10Is she inviting him in? What's the place like on the inside if so?
[00:49] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Are you…outside? You can just…knock…” 
02[00:50] * Quits: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-kcb.9ek.200.87.IP) (Client exited)
[00:51] <03Quaker> Shortly after, she opens the door to the “office.” He can see why the scare quotes are used when he steps in. It’s a series of desks in a small living room, connected to a kitchen that’s full of boxes and papers, and a tiny bed crammed into a corner. Clarabelle is hunched over, writing. 
[00:51] <03Crion_> 4There's certainly disciplines, blood magics that could be surveiling him and Kay right now -- the vampires wouldn't have to be in Laguna to use them, and Cav would be none the wiser. But what makes no sense is texting him to taunt about it.
[00:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Was there no bell?
[00:51] <03Crion_> 4Cav's not quite thinking straight at the moment, though. He told this asshole he'd be busy. This was date night!
[00:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Whatever. Wilson does whatever gets the door open.
[00:54] <03Quaker> There wasn’t! Sauer just opened the door for him. 
[00:55] <03Quaker> Has KJ ever been out in the canyons? The backwoods of Orange County? 
[00:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I was looking for a bell. It's been a while since I just knocked on somebody's door." 10Like... forty years? Probably around there.
01[00:57] <03banana> 6She's been over them, like in a plane. Otherwise, no. The hills are nice but that's because they've still got people.
01[00:57] <03banana> 6..how, she wonders, do Okienka and Aguilar feed out here? 
[00:59] <03Quaker> Sauer closes the door behind him and climbs onto a pile of boxes tall enough so that while sitting on it, she’s roughly his standing height. “Not a lot of creature comforts out here. But that just means fewer distractions. How can I help you, Baron?” 
[01:00] <03tom> "What the fuck are you talking about, man? I texted you 'cause you said you were busy tonight, didn't wanna bother you-" 14He's digging some kernal of lint out from the inside of his pocket with his free hand. "I got a lead on Sponger."
[01:01] <03Crion_> 4Cav spits the words. "The Trattoria Impresario."
[01:01] <03tom> "Yeah, yeah it's uh, owned by his cousin or somethin'. Look man I'm sorry, I didn't mean to piss you off..."
[01:01] <03Crion_> "I can tell you that Sponger is not in the Trattoria Impresario."
[01:01] <03Crion_> "Do you know how I know that?"
[01:02] <03tom> 14He shuts his eyes. "I do not know how you know that."
[01:02] <03Quaker> As the roads become less and less congested, and the lights of the cities begin to disappear, the wide curves of the hills rise to embrace KJ. The land turns from concrete and stucco to wood and soil. The trees form a canopy over her head with their thick boughs. If she rolls her windows down, she’ll smell the soft and cool earth scented by eucalyptus and oak. 
[01:02] <03Crion_> "Because I am standing on the sidewalk outside the Trattoria Impresario, the restaurant in which until two minutes ago I was having a very relaxing dinner with my partner."
[01:02] <03tom> "Aw fuck, man."
[01:02] <03tom> "I'm real sorry."
[01:03] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Where did you get this tip."
[01:03] <03tom> "I got it from Father Soria himself."
[01:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's fine to stand. Nice digs. "I'm looking for ways to be more active in the church. Now, we can talk about money, and where you need it to go, but I don't just mean that. You know about the mess with Cosmo Morgan, yeah? Down in Laguna?"
[01:05] <03tom> 14Tommy holds his phone against the side of his head with his shoulder while he lights up another cigarette. This time, it does do something for him.
01[01:06] <03banana> 6Could be worse. It's not bright lights and it's not crowds but there could be birds? Fellow tweeters. 
01[01:06] <03banana> 6Actually it's nice as hell and reminds KJ of her childhood but she's a bit worried about the prospect of having too much time to think.
[01:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav takes a few deep breaths, pauses, and then says: "So this is what we're going to do. The restaurant's kitchen closes at 1 AM. The attached bar stays open until 2:30 AM. I am going to go back inside, finish my dinner, take my partner home, and when the night free of business that I promised my partner is complete, I will meet you outside this restaurant at two in the morning, and 
[01:06] <03Crion_> then we will handle this."
[01:06] <03Quaker> Clarabelle stops writing and looks up. “Yes?” 
[01:07] <03tom> "Yeah, yeah, ok- you aren't gonna kick my ass, are you?"
[01:07] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Not unless you text or call me again before two."
[01:07] <03tom> "Shit."
[01:07] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I will see you then, Deacon."
[01:08] <03Crion_> 4He hangs up.
[01:08] <03tom> "He's totally gonna fuckin kick my ass."
[01:08] <03tom> 14He pounds his fist against the wall. "Goddamnit."
[01:08] <03Crion_> 4By the time he's back inside, an apologetic smile is back on his face.
[01:09] <03Crion_> 4Kay: "...Everything alright?"
[01:09] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Everything's great. Guy's just an asshole."
[01:09] <03Crion_> 4Dinner continues and then concludes, hopefully blissfully free of further interruption.
01[01:11] <03banana> 6..wait, she should have used the drive to call Jessie or Wilson! Wow. Frederick Taylor would be rolling over in his grave. 
[01:12] <03Quaker> The Modjeska estate is situated on the side of a road that stopped being paved two miles ago, beyond a wrought-iron gate and a faded white picket fence. She can see the Baroness sitting on the porch, wrapped in a shawl, sitting next to a man in his 20s. “Just park in the driveway,” she calls. When the engine cuts out, the only sound is that of crickets. It’s colder out here. The smells and sounds are different. 
[01:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson blinks. "Presbyter Vincent, hello. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Now my understanding is that this is being resolved by the Judex. Obviously Lord Bren is the aggrieved party, and since the incident was in Baron Cavanaugh's territory I'm sure you've got his attention too. But do you have a formal advocate from the covenant yourselves? Who's representing the Parish?"
[01:14] <03Crion_> 4Cav will return at 2 AM, having left Kay dozing in their bed -- something else she's gotten used to. He hasn't put his tie back on, leaving the top few buttons of his dress shirt undone, but he's otherwise dressed in his usual black slacks and jacket.
[01:14] <03Crion_> 4He'll park a couple streets away and walk the rest on foot. He should be able to feel Tommy approaching, if he's not already there.
[01:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll sort of sidle over such that he can see both Sauer and Vincent as he speaks. He's also unconsciously placed himself with a back to the wall.
[01:17] <03tom> 14Tommy's slouching in a nearby alley, grumbling.
01[01:17] <03banana> 6Too late now. KJ rolls up the window - in case of birds - and steps out, away from the little pinging noises the car makes in the cold. She ended up with a thinner dress, something that would be a bad idea out here if body temperature was still a thing. "Hey, Baroness. Mr. Aguilar, maybe Lord. Lord Secretary?"
01[01:18] <03banana> "I'm never totally sure if we're going full Pride and Prejudice."
[01:20] <03Quaker> “Just Santiago. I thinked I topped out as a ‘Mr.’ over in the places that care.” The Baroness stands. “Shall we go inside? I didn’t know if you were hungry, Baron Valentine. But our kitchen is fully stocked, if you are. We’re a bit more informal out here. We save the table settings for real parties.” 
[01:20] <03tom> 14At 2AM, Tommy slides out of the alley, tosses off his cigarette, and heads over to the Trattoria.
[01:21] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “If this becomes something the Episcopate has to go to court for? Presbyter Morse. We can always ask he be replaced by an alternative, though. Then it would be Tracey Greene.” 
[01:22] <03Crion_> 4Cav finds him pretty quickly -- that Obfuscate Tommy's using is good; Cav can only tell there's another Kindred in the area, can't really pinpoint him -- but he's also met Tommy before, so. It's pretty obvious, then, who it is.
[01:23] <03Crion_> 4Cav meets him a block or so away from the restaurant.
[01:24] <03tom> 14It isn't clear who sees who first. Tommy is in his hoodie, earbuds in. His phone is in his hand, and the song it's playing is Extreme Ways.
01[01:25] <03banana> 6KJ: "All good, I had some breakfast last week." 6She'll follow the couple (seems that way) inside, admiring anything there is to admire. KJ likes seeing how people arrange and decorate their homes.
[01:25] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Deacon."
[01:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah. I'd like to offer my services more informally. To help broker a deal before it goes to court."
[01:26] <03tom> 14Tommy glances up, pockets his phone, croaks out a "Yeah?"
[01:26] <03Crion_> "Welcome to Laguna." 4Baron Laguna is not smiling.
[01:27] <03tom> "Nnnononono."
[01:28] <03tom> 14He blocks this out in the air with hand gestures. "What you meant to say was, 'Sorry for being a huge fuckin' asshole, Welcome to Laguna.'"
[01:29] <03Crion_> 4Cav stands there, staring at him a moment. Is this guy for real?
[01:30] <03tom> 14The nosferatu doesn't smile either.
[01:30] <03Quaker> Clarabelle considers him a moment. “Why the sudden interest in a distant parish’s legal representation, Baron?” 
01[01:31] <03banana> 6It's kind of funny to meet and hear Santiago alongside Teresa, who's so gently formal she could live off it. Or does, maybe. Otherwise they seem well suited - both self sufficient, both kind of hot. Living out in the middle of nowhere, though. Is that romantic or just inconvenient?
[01:32] <03Crion_> 4Cav's hands ripple into hideous claws. He takes a step forward. "You come into my territory, interrupting my night, seeking my help, and you expect me to apologize to you?"
[01:34] <03tom> 14He raises his hands. "I thought we were working together on this. I thought we had a common cause, here."
[01:34] <03tom> "Put those away. Waste of damn time."
[01:34] <03Crion_> 4The streets are empty. They can take this into the alley if they need to.
[01:37] <03Quaker> The Modjeska house is actually quite beautiful inside. If she didn’t notice the California State Historical Landmark plaque outside, then she’ll surely think it deserves one as she looks around its Arts and Crafts interior. The seats and couches are carved into the long wood pieces of the house itself, and the soft lighting complements the river-stone fireplace and rows of bookcases, each with their own glass fronts, reinforced with small
[01:37] <03Quaker> iron designs. 
[01:39] <03Quaker> Teresa sits on a couch that’s under an oil portrait of herself. Opposite her, there’s a large projector hooked up to a laptop. “How was the ballet?” 
[01:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Something Presbyter Sauer said to me a few nights ago. 'The range of acceptable thought has widened.' You know better than I do how the Episcopate, for all the good it does, finds itself at the odds with the needs of the people it ought to protect. And we all know just how far the First Estate's magnaminity extends."
[01:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The Orange County Parish is the most important political project in the Brilliant Court in generations. I have an ethical obligation, as a defender of the Court, to see it flourish. And I have a moral obligation to be of use."
[01:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So that's why I'm here."
[01:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Oh I agree. This is a massive waste of time. But I'm here anyway. I don't work for you, Deacon. I'm working with you right now because of the regard I have for Presbyter Vincent. And you've done nothing but yank me around and spit in my face. So come on, whatever the fuck your name is, tell me more about what I meant to say."
[01:42] <03tom> "That's not why you're working with me. You're working with me because you hate Cosmo Morgan."
[01:42] <03tom> "And now you're drawing down on me because I didn't kiss the ring. Well, tough shit,  pal."
[01:42] <03Crion_> 4Cavanaugh laughs. "I don't hate Cosmo Morgan. Morgan's not important enough to hate."
[01:43] <03tom> "Then Bren, or whoever. I can't imagine you're capable of kind feelings to anyone."
01[01:44] <03banana> 6KJ oohs and aahs at the furniture! She's used to leaning on walls but most of them really don't deserve it here. Perhaps she'll actually sit?
01[01:44] <03banana> KJ: "There was a rich and varied cast of characters."
01[01:44] <03banana> 6KJ: "Consequently, I can't tell you much about the ballet itself.. the music seemed great, when audible above the drama."
[01:45] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “I agree with you about the parish’s importance, Baron.” She looks for the polite way of phrasing this. “Your interest comes as a surprise. I was led to believe that your own concerns took up most of your time and attention.” 
[01:45] <03Quaker> Something pings Cav’s radar. 
[01:45] <03Quaker> A predator. 
[01:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "You--"
[01:45] <03Crion_> 4He pauses.
[01:46] <03Quaker> Actually, it’s faint. But…growing stronger? And coming out of the alley he was recently referred to? 
[01:46] <03Crion_> "Something's coming."
[01:47] <03tom> 14Tommy backs away and reaches into his hoodie. Cav can hear duct tape rip free.
[01:48] <03tom> "What's coming?"
[01:48] <03Crion_> 4Cav's eyes narrow. "Predator."
[01:49] <03Quaker> Teresa: “I can’t say I care for the drama. The ballet, however…” 
[01:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm aware of my reputation, Presbyter. No need to beat around the bush. Listen, it's been a weird couple of nights for me. But my time and attention are flexible. I'm here because I think I can be of use."
[01:49] <03Quaker> “I hope you were able to avoid any sinister machinations or dangerous plots.” 
[01:51] <03Quaker> If either of them peek into the alley, they can see something irregular. It’s like…something’s wearing away at the natural light of the place. It’s…shifting. And the outline of something massive, easily twice their size, is becoming clearer. It’s long and sleek….and the front end has the natural slope and pointed end of a hunting animal…
[01:52] <03tom> "Yeah that's not Sponger."
[01:53] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Shit."
[01:53] <03Quaker> The light pulses once. Twice. A rip begins to form. They can smell something like embers… 
01[01:53] <03banana> 6KJ: "Oh, they were happening to other people. I did get grilled to a fine char by some mysterious.. I mean, it was an Invictus event."
01[01:54] <03banana> "Seems like you get by without the dances out here?"
[01:54] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Who was the mysterious so and so?” Santiago sits down next to her, and she gets more comfortable by putting her legs over his. 
[01:54] <03tom> "You know what, fuck today." 14Tommy pulls off his hoodie and throws it furiously to the ground. Taped to his back is a lever-action shotgun.
[01:55] <03Quaker> She nods. “I grew up with it. I’ve had enough for a lifetime, frankly. The ability to control who you see and for how long is very underappreciated, I think.” 
[01:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav shrugs off his jacket. "Agreed."
[01:57] <03Quaker> The space tears in two! And the primordial beast bounds out, roaring. “Raaaa-“ It’s a huge, fearsome wolf, its flanks covered in blood. Its face is a mask of fire, and its shoulders are giving off a waterfall of mist that combine to make a slight cloud of steam. “aaaa-“ 
[01:57] <03tom> 14Tommy: "Hey man, fuck off!"
[01:59] <03Quaker> The great wolf comes to a halt in the middle of the alley. “Oh, sorry. I didn’t see you there.” The flames on its face die down to a few smoldering remnants. “Hello, Cavanaugh. Sorry for the, uh…” It turns its head to look at itself. “Blood. And noise. Bit of a crash landing.” 
01[01:59] <03banana> 6KJ: "Well! That's the Facebook premise, right? Infinitely fractal privacy, everyone seeing only who and what they're interested in. You could kind of reinvent it here with sheer distance as proxy for privacy controls."
[01:59] <03Crion_> 4...
[02:00] <03Crion_> 4Cav takes a step back to the mouth of the alley and quickly glances around to see if anyone's coming running. Or is watching.
[02:00] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Oh…I don’t really use the internet.” 
[02:02] <03Quaker> Even if Cav doesn’t remember, his radar does. Anyway, Joanie is quickly hunched over, the fur and fire and mist disappearing as she assumes her human form again. Now, it’s just her baggy pants and old t-shirt that are covered in blood. “This is Laguna Beach, right?” 
[02:03] <03Crion_> 4Cav steps back into the alley. "...Yyyyes. Hello, Joanie."
01[02:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "I know. This is actually something I've been wondering about."
01[02:03] <03banana> "And uh please please stop me if I'm being rude. But!"
[02:04] <03Crion_> 4To the Deacon: "It's fine."
[02:04] <03Crion_> "I know her."
01[02:04] <03banana> "In the last couple of months I've met a ton of people, right? Another rich and varied cast. The Brilliant Court, and it does shine. Almost everybody is.. behind the times."
[02:04] <03tom> 14Tommy is staring bug-eyed at Cavanaugh. 
01[02:05] <03banana> "Which you'd expect! Given the circumstances. Here's what concerns me, though: the world is changing really fast now."
[02:05] <03tom> 14He slowly lowers his hands from the weapon taped to his shirt- it's heavy, the duct tape goes around his chest the whole way to keep it secure.
01[02:05] <03banana> "Do we think we can get away without ever catching up?
[02:05] <03tom> 14He grabs his hoodie up off the street and bundles it into a ball. "You guys need a moment?"
[02:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav looks up at Joanie, directing the question her way. Is she just dropping by for a social visit, or...?
[02:07] <03Quaker> Joanie: “I was just leaving. Did I interrupt something?” 
[02:07] <03tom> "Nnnnnnnnoo."
[02:07] <03Crion_> "No, no." 4He pauses, imagining her seeing the vampire with claws and vampire with shotgun denying anything was about to happen but a civil conversation.
[02:08] <03Crion_> "Actually, wait."
[02:08] <03Quaker> Joanie: “Mhm.” 
[02:09] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "You remember that guy from Dana Point, one of us, name of Sponger?"
[02:10] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “What kind of use? I don’t mean to be rude, Baron. I’m just wondering what you had in mind. I’m juggling a few different balls here. If you’d like to join the search for our missing accused parishioner, I’d appreciate the extra set of eyes.” 
[02:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson waves his hand. "Look, I know exactly how suspicious this is. And I know that the kind of faith I'm asking for hasn't historically been rewarded. And I know that you two know that too."
[02:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But I'm still asking for it, because I don't know where else I'd turn."
[02:11] <03Quaker> Joanie:“The death-spirit with the checkered bandana? Yes, I remember him. Why?” 
[02:11] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "You seen him around lately?"
[02:11] <03Quaker> Joanie: “Yes.” 
[02:12] <03Crion_> 4Aha.
01[02:12] <03banana> 6KJ is kind of wide-eyed here. She knows it's an odd question to ask at a social meetup, but the answer.. determines a lot of things. Occasionally it's worth putting yourself out there for information.
[02:12] <03Crion_> 4Cav glances over at the Deacon. "Mind telling us where? He's in some trouble, and if we don't get him out of it, well..."
01[02:12] <03banana> 6Sometimes it's worth putting yourself out there just to be known. Always, actually.
[02:12] <03tom> "Yeah, he's a friend."
[02:13] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "There might be a lot more of our Kindred hanging around here, soon. The real asshole kind."
[02:13] <03Quaker> Teresa: “That’s a good question. I think their perspective on the question is colored by their age, naturally. And also from their pedigree. My family, of course, considers itself removed from the normal and petty requirements of the nightly struggle.” 
[02:13] <03Quaker> Joanie: “No, I wouldn’t mind.” 
[02:14] <03tom> "Uh, hi," 14he offers. "Tommy Saldana. You are...?"
[02:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Right. Where are my manners."
[02:15] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “We have legal representation, Baron. As dubious as it might be. So I’m afraid I can’t accept your help there. What did you mean by a deal?” 
[02:16] <03Crion_> "Deacon Tommy Saldana, meet Joanie Fire-Under-the-Water. She's a friend. Comes and goes in these parts as she pleases."
[02:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Like I said, there are a lot of things I can offer. Financial support. A voice in the covenant from someone without a political stake in the Parish succeeding or failing. But I think the key thing right now is to make sure your guy's life never ends up in the Episcopate's hands in the first place. Because once it does it's as good as in Bren's."
[02:16] <03tom> 14He offers a guarded smile. "Charmed."
[02:17] <03tom> 14He wiggles back into his hoodie and stretches the fabric over the cut-down barrel of the shotgun.
01[02:18] <03banana> 6Oh, yeah. The wealthy. KJ, who was the first person in her family to go to college: "Let's say we can insulate ourselves from the tides of change. Ghouls at the edge to understand the current milleu, ghouls inbetween who understand both us and the ones in touch with the world. Do you think we'd have lost anything?"
[02:20] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Have you met my mother?” 
[02:22] <03Quaker> Joanie: “Yeah. Same. Problem, though. I told him I wouldn’t. After he asked. I gather the trouble and the asshole death-spirits are related.” 
[02:22] <03Crion_> 4Cav sighs. "That sounds...likely."
01[02:23] <03banana> Moth- oh. In the sense of..? "I've met the Marquise Figueroa?"
01[02:23] <03banana> 6KJ: "More 'been near'. Quite far away from, but she comes through at a distance."
[02:23] <03Crion_> 4He glances over at Tommy. "Though I will admit I haven't been fully appraised of the situation. Just that Sponger needs to be found."
[02:23] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Then we want the same thing. Shall I give you the name and number of our people trying to find him?” 
[02:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sure." 10Wilson doesn't take out a notepad or anything.
[02:26] <03tom> "I'm with the Church. Did Sponger mention that to you?"
[02:26] <03Crion_> 4It's sometimes hard to tell which parts of Joanie's lingo are different words for concepts that Kindred have, and which parts are like, well, literal death-spirits running amok.
[02:27] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Then you’ll know how I represent my family dragging itself a few centuries forward. Electricity. Film. Parties instead of hunts. Choosing who we love,” she says, patting Santiago. “And if I ever have a childe-“ Santiago coughs - “theoretically, I mean. But I think they’d be just as eager to be as modern as you are. But we can each only ever go so far from what we were raised in.” 
[02:28] <03Quaker> Joanie: “No. But I found him praying. Not surprising.” 
[02:28] <03Crion_> 4Cav sighs again. "Guess not."
[02:28] <03Quaker> Joanie: “These other death-spirits…bad news? The ones looking for him?” 
[02:29] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Bren."
[02:29] <03Crion_> "And probably our secret police."
[02:30] <03Quaker> Clarabelle gives him Tommy’s phone number. “They’re still in the process of locating him. I believe they’re slowly bringing Baron Cavanaugh into the loop.” 
[02:30] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "They probably won't mess with you, but keep your eyes open. And from now on, don't assume that any Kindred you don't know skulking around Laguna or Dana Point is gonna be scared of you, or isn't expecting you. These people mean very serious business."
[02:31] <03tom> "Scary shit, lady," 14Tommy echoes.
01[02:31] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's not a bad perspective. Actually I'm unsure how to articulate why it doesn't feel entirely-" 
01[02:31] <03banana> "It's at odds with eternity. The idea of going on forever - that would have to involve change, forever."
[02:32] <03tom> "Uh, look, if you can't tell us where Sponger is- can you tell him to check in with us? We could talk over a phone, or.. somethin'."
[02:32] <03Crion_> "I'm not going to ask you to break his confidence. But if you do see him again, let him know I'm looking for him -- and that it'll be a lot better if he finds us before Bren's people find him."
[02:33] <03tom> "Yeah the uh, Baron here says he's willing to maybe help him out with some legal..." 14he peters out.
[02:33] <03Crion_> 4Cav doubt Sponger cares about legal, at this point.
[02:34] <03Crion_> 4But there's always hope.
[02:34] <03Quaker> Joanie bares her teeth in what might be a smile. “You spirits are more trouble than you’re worth.” She thinks it over. “I knew him well enough. But he doesn’t have a phone. What would you do if you found him? Your plans for him.” 
[02:34] <03tom> "Well a bunch of rude assholes are out to kill his ass, so I was thinkin', if nothing else fails we can bundle him into a van and set him free or something..."
[02:34] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Well, nothing lasts forever. And no one lives forever. But not everyone manages to live well.” 
[02:34] <03tom> everything*
[02:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav looks over at Tommy, somewhat surprised. "Well, it'll depend on what he has to say about what happened between him and the little shitbird who's pressing charges." 4Come to think of it, no one has actually told Cav what Sponger is alleged to have done.
[02:35] <03Crion_> 4Just that Morgan's involved.
[02:37] <03Quaker> Joanie: “He told me he beat a bad person very badly.” 
[02:37] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "...Well, that sounds about right."
[02:38] <03tom> "He kicked the shit outta Cosmo Morgan," 14Tommy whispers.
[02:38] <03Quaker> Joanie: “And if you found him? These worse death-spirits would go away? No more sniffing around down here?” 
01[02:38] <03banana> 6The thing is, if KJ had to pick one of the two... 
[02:38] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "For now, at least."
01[02:38] <03banana> 6.. "So it's not a problem in practice. Well I won't pester you about the online! I'll live with having, like, just two sad little contacts in my phone for the people who use this stuff."
[02:38] <03tom> "So when you say 'Death Spirits'."
[02:38] <03tom> "Do you mean guys like us, orrrr."
01[02:39] <03banana> "Maybe some of the new cohort will be into it. Baron Cypress, or Baron Laguna Beach from the big city."
[02:39] <03Quaker> Joanie: “You can’t smell yourself? You reek of death.” 
[02:39] <03tom> "No need to roast me, here."
[02:40] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "She smells in a different way than we do, Tommy."
[02:40] <03tom> "I got it, I got it."
[02:40] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Good talking to you, Joanie. Don't be a stranger. Especially if weird assholes start showing up."
[02:41] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Well, your faith is in technology. There are other powers, of course. As deep and reliable as capitalism is fickle and destructive. The Blood doesn’t need to be patched.” She looks at Santiago. “I used that correctly, right?” He nods. 
[02:41] <03Quaker> Joanie: “Wait.” 
[02:41] <03Crion_> "You know. Weirder than us."
[02:42] <03Crion_> 4?
01[02:43] <03banana> 6:D "Right! You know again this is probably rude, but I'm really curious: do you mean capitalism as opposed to, like, the feudal system we once had?"
[02:44] <03Quaker> The werewolf sniffs. “I’ll tell you where he is. I remember the stories about the times before it was quiet here.” 
[02:45] <03Quaker> Joanie: “As long as you keep it from here.” 
[02:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav's eyebrows shoot up. "Oh. Thank you. ...I'll do whatever I can. In a very literal sense."
[02:45] <03Crion_> "Leisurely lives here too, you know."
[02:47] <03tom> "I have an interest in keeping Sponger safe."
[02:47] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Well, don’t say ‘once had’ around my family. They’ve hardly been deposed and won’t appreciate you insinuating that they’re some sort of remnant. But, yes. ‘All that is solid melts into air’ and all that. Although we’ve been able to absorb them far better than they’ve been able to influence us.” 
[02:50] <03Quaker> Joanie: “That’s why I’m telling you.” She seems to mean that as answer to both of them. “I don’t know the name of it. An old estate, down in the canyons. It used to belong to one of you. A death-spirit. There was some violence there a few months back. I heard it’s been abandoned ever since. Santiago Canyon.” 
[02:50] <03tom> 14Tommy is already texting this to Soria.
[02:50] <03Crion_> 4Cav closes his eyes. "Ah shit."
[02:51] <03tom> "Yeah?"
[02:52] <03Quaker> Teresa: “But really, their servile nature comes as no surprise. That’s always been the way of the bourgeoisie. Dangle a minor title in front of their eyes and they’ll become a more fanatical defender of your order than you ever could. Yourself excepted, of course. Baron.” 
01[02:53] <03banana> 6Why does that phrase sound familiar? Also what the hell is this conversation.
[02:53] <03Crion_> "The Thomas Franks estate."
[02:53] <03Crion_> 4He opens his eyes. "That violence Joanie's talking about? I was there for it.
[02:53] <03Crion_> "
[02:54] <03tom> "Ah shit."
[02:54] <03Crion_> 4Cav grimaces. "Thanks a million, Joanie. We'll make sure...well, we'll make sure things stay quiet."
[02:55] <03tom> "Yeah, uh, thanks."
01[02:56] <03banana> 6KJ: "Don't worry, I'm hardly exceptional. Pedigree of Skid Row, dangling accomplished. Did you study political theory, Baroness? Sounds like a long-view thing."
[02:59] <03Quaker> Teresa: “My mother and aunt both insisted on a thorough education. Although it eventually became more thorough than the former could appreciate.” She gestures to her house. “The long view is our natural habitat, isn’t it? It would hardly do to govern ourselves based on the promises of technologies that exhaust and obsolete themselves in a few years’ time. There’s nothing less ephemeral than land.” 
[03:01] <03Quaker> The Baroness Modjeska has spent the entire conversation slowly falling over onto Santiago. Now, snuggled deeply, she remembers: “Oh, don’t forget to remind me to give you that copy of Fury Road. 4K, black and white.” 
01[03:03] <03banana> KJ recrosses her arms and legs. "You've made the point that it would be incautious to think modern advances can obsolete a form of social relation which has outlasted so many. Rooted as it is in veins. I admit I am really curious now in the taste in films you get from that perspective!"
01[03:03] <03banana> "Course there's always the possibility that this time really is different."
01[03:03] <03banana> "Where'd you get a black and white copy?"
[03:04] <03Quaker> “A friend. Do you know Wilson Frost, Baron Hollywood? He’s connected in that industry.” 
[03:06] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Even if this time is different, I’m afraid I can’t be. I’ve already moved as far as I can given my circumstances. Luckily, I’ve landed in a wonderful place.” 
01[03:06] <03banana> "Oh, yes! He's quite charming, isn't he?"
[03:06] <03tom> 14Tommy raises his hands, his phone in one of them. "Here, can you give this to Sponger? Tell him to call Soria, it's important."
[03:07] <03Quaker> Joanie: “No. I swore that I would not look for him again.” She looks in the direction of the ocean. “I guess I’m swimming back. Goodnight, spirits.” 
01[03:08] <03banana> 6What a relic. A smart one. She's actually the first person in years to make KJ second-guess San Francisco, reevaluate what's better and worse about how they do things here. And she's built a beautiful nest for herself. Almost admirable.
[03:08] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Goodnight, Joanie. Thanks again."
[03:08] <03Crion_> 4As an afterthought, he retracts his claws.
[03:08] <03Crion_> 4Then: "If we're going out to the Franks estate, we're going to need more than just you and me."
[03:08] <03tom> "Uh, yeah, alright."
[03:08] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Well. He is. Don’t let that fool you, though. He’s also worth knowing.” 
[03:09] <03tom> "Is it still dangerous?"
[03:09] <03Crion_> "That violence? It was with the Circle."
[03:09] <03tom> "Holy fuck this day just keeps getting better."
[03:09] <03Crion_> "Well, the Circle's still out there. So as far as I know, yeah."
[03:09] <03Crion_> 4He pauses. "We didn't get off on the right foot. I want to tell you a story."
[03:09] <03Crion_> "It might explain why I reacted the way I did to your text message tonight."
[03:09] <03tom> 14Tommy is still patting down his hoodie.
[03:10] <03tom> 14He finishes, rolls his shoulders, nods.
[03:10] <03Crion_> "Last year, I was a deputy out in the Orange County administrative area. I had a job, and I was doing it along with two other guys. We were investigating -- well, it doesn't matter what we were investigating. One night, one of the other deputies goes and pokes around, I dunno, an old nursing home. Tangentially related."
[03:10] <03Crion_> "Disappears."
[03:11] <03Crion_> "We get him back three nights later."
[03:11] <03Crion_> 4Cav crosses his arms. "He was kidnapped by a group of LA vampires, Brilliant Court vampires, led by a guy named Bill Burne. You know that name?"
01[03:11] <03banana> 6KJ: "Oh, they've never been mutually exclusive. Saying what people want to hear is a valuable skill."
01[03:12] <03banana> 6Maybe it goes on for some time like this, a weird kind of fencing between two women realising that they are, on some level, enemies. Could be, on some level, friends. Maybe they'll get around to a movie.
[03:13] <03tom> "Holy shit."
[03:13] <03tom> "No, I- I never heard that name. Jesus Christ."
[03:13] <03Crion_> "Bill Burne's the Baron of North Long Beach, and the childe of Donald Bren, arguably the most powerful vampire in Lost Angeles. He's also the head of the secret police."
[03:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "We get Rollie back and I get all angry and go back up to that nursing home and get myself kidnapped. And Burne sits me down in an interrogation room and we have a real long talk about what I was and wasn't allowed to do. And then he eventually cut me loose too, because the point in the main was that I didn't matter -- and he could pick me back up whenever he wanted."
[03:15] <03Quaker> As they’re finishing their evening together, Teresa takes KJ’s hand in hers. It’s even warm. “Thank you for a pleasant time, Baron. I hope you’ll consider us your friends. They’re so rare, considering. And those of us without the privilege of relations we never earned need them more than anyone.” 
[03:16] <03Crion_> "My partner doesn't know any of this. She doesn't even know what I am. So when a vampire I barely know texts me the name of the restaurant where I'm eating dinner with her without me having told him where I was going or what I was doing beforehand, well."
[03:16] <03Crion_> "I reacted out of proportion to the cause."
[03:17] <03tom> "You guys really like to go hard in L.A. I see."
[03:17] <03Crion_> 4Cav's smile is wan. "I'm a bit more direct than most guys out here. Told I'm a bit angrier, too."
[03:17] <03tom> 14He turns away from Cav, shaking his head. "Look, man, you don't gotta say shit. I'm sorry I'm a petty fuckin' asshole."
[03:18] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "And I'm sorry your first piece of work in peacetime put you on a collison course with me."
[03:18] <03tom> "I just.. you know how these Invictus guys are. You let 'em disrespect you even just a bit-"
[03:18] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I do know."
[03:18] <03tom> "I think, 'hey, I'll just make some noise, see what happens'."
[03:19] <03tom> "Yeah. Yeah." 14He's nodding. "Phhoo boy. What happened to your friend after you got him back?"
[03:19] <03Crion_> 4Cav pauses. "He left town."
[03:19] <03tom> "Jeez."
[03:20] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Of the original four of us, only me and Santiago Aguilar remain. And he's more or less retired."
[03:21] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "And I don't want to ask him to go back out to the Franks estate. He's a married man, and his wife could kick my ass."
[03:21] <03Crion_> "Which means we need more people."
[03:21] <03tom> 14Tommy puts his chin to his chest, stares at the ground for a little while. "Well, look, I'll make some calls, see if I can get some guys from the Church to back me up."
[03:21] <03tom> "We've got a few heavy-hitters here 'n there."
[03:22] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "We don't want too many, though. That'll draw their attention. Quality over quantity, here."
[03:23] <03tom> "Yeah. Okay. Can we do this without having to fight? O.C. Parish borders Circle turf in a few places-"
[03:23] <03tom> "I don't wanna make things worse."
[03:24] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "We can certainly try."
[03:25] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "If you want to get some sneaks together and Obfuscate your way in there, be my guest. But you might want me along to talk to Sponger, and also in case the Circle finds you anyway."
[03:25] <03tom> "Okay. Yeah. I'll uh- what's a good time to text you, when- when you won't be busy."
[03:26] <03Crion_> 4Cav smiles. "My calendar's clear for the next couple days. You can text me whenever in the future."
[03:27] <03tom> "Cooool," 14he says, while backing off into the night, before things get weirder.
[03:27] <03Crion_> 4Cav lets him go, walking over to pick his jacket up off the ground, then heads back to his car.
[03:27] <03Crion_> 4The fucking Franks estate.
[03:28] <03Crion_> 4You're raising a lot of old ghosts, Sponger. Hope it's worth it.
01[03:29] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hey, I'm glad it was pleasant after all. You two are definitely certified Nice in my book - which is a rigorous book such as a bookmaker might keep. We'll be seeing each other, I'm sure!" 6And maybe friendship would be less rare if it wasn't such a big deal because everyone has to wait until someone congenial climbs into their exact social stratum. 
01[03:29] <03banana> 6The Brilliant Court makes such a big damn issue about trust when there's a model for a society that can work fine *without* needing everyone to trust everyone else. It's just over there and it's called America.

[22:53] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgG3EaOCh_c
[22:55] <03Quaker> It’s raining harder than ever. Even Wilson, who has lived here the longest, can’t remember a storm like this. The last week has had no let-up - every day it feels like the raindrops are growing larger, and the winds are growing stronger. 
[22:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Drought's over.
[22:56] <03Quaker> In the meantime, Tommy and Cav have received a tip - whether they’ll bring in their erstwhile ally or Cav’s minder before they act on it is up to them. 
[22:57] <03Crion_> 4When Cav wakes, the girls are curled up at the foot of the bed. Must be bad out there.
[22:58] <03tom> 14Yeah? What's the tip?
[22:58] <03Crion_> 4The Franks estate.
01[22:59] <03banana> 6It's been put off as long as she possibly can. Retrospect! KJ peers into the mirror in her mezzanine - she's looking at her own actions, not any visual reflection. 
01[22:59] <03banana> 6She's got to force an acquaintance with Clinton Cavanaugh.
[23:00] <03Crion_> 4Cavanaugh showers and begins to pull a suit out of the closet before hesitating and putting it back, opting for slacks and a black turtleneck. And boots, not wingtips.
[23:00] <03Crion_> 4The rain beating against the ceiling is unnerving.
01[23:01] <03banana> 6Who does she know that he knows? Jessie's set is no good, and Helena's contacts could be worse. There's mortal stuff. Or there's Leisurely Foster and Wilson Frost.
01[23:02] <03banana> 6There's also the club idea.. hmm. Kill two birds with one stone?
01[23:03] <03banana> 6Yeah, if this is going to work, though, it's got to be credible.. so far she's only managed to speak to Frances. But reaching out to everyone at the same time shouldn't be too suspicious. Technically, it's something she was going to do anyway.
[23:03] <03tom> 14Tommy's first play is to find Soria and see if he can drum up a few people to roll out to the Franks Estate with the Deacon.
01[23:04] <03banana> 6Baron Valentine sits on the bed for a few more minutes, arranging the idea like an algorithm. Then she pulls on a bra and a shirt and goes to decide whether to have breakfast.
[23:05] <03Quaker> Soria is upstairs, reading. “Muscle?” He looks up at Tommy, smiling uneasily. “You are all that comes to mind, Thomas.” 
[23:05] <03Crion_> 4Well, he drinks his blood for the night shirtless, at least. Best safeguard against spills. But he'll be fully dressed when he puts on coffee and begins perusing some books he got from Leisurely about...stuff.
[23:06] <03tom> 14Tommy stands in the doorway, doesn't come in. "Yeah, that's what I figured."
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What's Tommy's ringtone?
[23:07] <03tom> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-QD_HIfjA
[23:07] <03Crion_> 4Eventually, when Rush and Buchanon have been given enough time to get to work and settle in, he'll call the office and throw it on speaker.
[23:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's just started playing out of whichever pocket he keeps his phone in.
[23:08] <03tom> "Yeah.. I figured, we get enough people, get in, out fast, maybe we can- aw shit."
[23:08] <03Crion_> 4The conversation mainly revolves around whether he's gotten any new or interesting messages from Morse or the Judex, as well as informing them he'll be...out of office, tonight.
[23:08] <03tom> "Sorry." 14He winces, rolls the phone up into his palm. "Yeah?"
[23:09] <03Quaker> He hasn’t, and they reassure Cav that things are running smoothly without his personal involvement. 
[23:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Tommy hear's a woman's voice, clear and professional enough that it reminds him of a call from a doctor's office or something until "Good evening. I've got Baron Hollywood on the line for Mr. Saldana. Is he available to take a business call?"
[23:10] <03Crion_> 4Yeah well, out of office doesn't mean no personal involvement. He'll tell Rush to go into his office and, like he does many nights, forward calls to Cav's office phone to his mobile. Then he'll reach out across Laguna Beach. How's the flock feel tonight? Hopefully the rain is keeping the assholes indoors.
[23:12] <03tom> "Sure, patch 'em in." 14Tommy takes a ballpoint pen from his pocket along with a crumpled napkin and starts drawing. 
[23:12] <03Quaker> The rain is keeping everyone indoors, is the problem. The flock is getting restless after being cooped up for so many days in a row. Not only that, but now a few more streets than usual have been closed due to landslides and flooding. 
[23:14] <03Crion_> 4Boredom's unfortunate, but outside of a Shepherd's purview. As long as no vampires are fucking around doing home invasions he'll generally leave his people to their devices tonight.
[23:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "One moment please." 10There's a click and a click and a voice on the line, and a man is speaking. "Mr. Saldana. Wilson Frost here. How are you tonight?"
[23:15] <03tom> 14He's staring forward at Soria. "Busy. What's up?"
[23:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I had a chat with Presbyters Vincent and Sauer the other night. I understand you're the point man on the Souza thing."
[23:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I asked them how I could help and they gave me your number. So what do you need?"
01[23:17] <03banana> 6Tonight, again, KJ finds herself dictating messages to gofers. Jesus christ this is primitive. Anyway, after the one million years it takes for One's People to reach out to Their People she be in a credible position to start making some calls herself. Hide a key in a forest, surveillance among social climbing?
[23:19] <03tom> 14Tommy writes haphazardly as he speaks. "Oh yeah? Fucking awesome, do you know anyone bad ass enough to roll with us up to the Franks Estate to get Souza?"
[23:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah. Me."
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's up at Thomas Franks's old place?"
[23:20] <03Quaker> As KJ runs through her mental checklist of potential guests for her Club for the new barony, and makes calls to that effect, she gets more interest and less resistance than she expected. She doesn’t even have to ask Frances, really - but besides that, Glover, Primrose, and Heath are all open to meeting with her informally. Wesley Fitzroy is polite enough to personally tell her over the phone that his schedule is more than a bit unpredictabl
[23:20] <03Quaker> - the Wilderness Commission’s work comes and goes with little notice, after all, but he’d be happy to discuss it further. She doesn’t get a response from Munoz. It just goes to voicemail. 
[23:21] <03Crion_> 4He'll call Kay next, to check in and tell her good night. She's got school during the day tomorrow, if he recalls correctly.
01[23:21] <03banana> 6All good. She does want to get this thing off the ground - but the main purpose here is to be able to talk about what's planned.. she's not even sure why she hadn't contacted Laguna Beach yet. It's kind of too far away to remember.
[23:22] <03Crion_> 4Then he'll go back upstairs and get the shoulder holster out of his closet...and the Glock 17 out of the gunsafe right below it.
[23:22] <03tom> 14He passes the note across the table to Soria, gives a thumbs up. The napkin reads: don't worry about this i can handle it. To the side there's a a crudely drawn stick-man also giving a thumbs-up.
[23:24] <03tom> 14He returns his attention to the call: "Yeah? That's- okay, that's something. Any help I can get is good enough, here. Should we discuss costs now, or...?"
01[23:24] <03banana> 6I won't ask what Wilson's ringtone is, since it'd really be Nora or Cora.
[23:25] <03tom> "We got a tip Sponger's out there, yeah. Who knows if it's good, but there's only one way to know."
[23:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The phone KJ reaches at the Paramount office has a regular ringtone. "Business line."
[23:26] <03Quaker> Soria looks at the note. “Hm,” is all he says. 
[23:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What's the loadout. Are we mounting up for a hunt?"
[23:26] <03tom> 14Tommy turns, waves to Soria and starts back down the stairs.
[23:26] <03tom> "Oh man I hope not."
01[23:27] <03banana> 6Anaheim: "Valentine for Mr. Frost. That's a name, not a promise."
[23:27] <03tom> "I think the classy move here is to bring enough people that no one rando who bumps into us wants to deal with it, and we're gone before the time it takes for him to get the whole army."
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "How armed should we be?"
[23:28] <03tom> "Dunno. What've you got?"
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sword."
01[23:28] <03banana> 6Honestly, the different arrangements each vampire makes to keep their privacy and create a safe, buffered interface to the world - one full of cops as well as enemies and friends and targets - is something which really interests KJ. That eclectic variety of tenuous connections..
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The woman on the line, who it so happens is Nora, says: "He's on another call. Would you like me to take a message or if you hold just a minute I can put you through."
[23:29] <03tom> 14Tommy stops, nods vigorously. "I respect that a great deal."
[23:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Alright. Where and when?"
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4They probably discussed meeting at that bar.
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4Father's?
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4Cav has a history there.
[23:30] <03tom> "Cool." 14Tommy rattles off the agreed-upon info. Father's.
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4It's right at the mouth of the valley.
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ: "Sure, I'll hold. What's it like working in the pictures?"
[23:30] <03tom> "So far it,s you, me, and Clinton Cavanaugh, which is probably enough?"
[23:30] <03Crion_> 4Last outpost of LA before a night in the woods.
[23:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nora: "Oh, you meet the most interesting people." 10Wilson: "I'll be there." 10He's about to hang up when he sees another light blinking on the phone. He can't remember the last time he had two open lines on the same night. 10Nora sees the first line go dark and says "One moment." 10To Wilson: "I've got 'Valentine' on line 2." 10Wilson: "Suuure. Put her through."
[23:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A moment later KJ's got Wilson in her ear. "Evening, Baron."
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: "Baron!! I'm bereft. Your abandonment has left me bereft."
[23:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Aw, I know, I know. I got called away. Hardly got to enjoy the ballet. I'm Ms. Foster was adequate company."
01[23:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah, she was uh. Way more company than you'd expect."
01[23:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "Don't apologise, though. I'd like to guilt you into helping me scrape an acquaintance, please."
[23:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Well, here I am, guilty. What do you need?"
[23:37] <03Crion_> 4The last thing Cav will do to prepare is locate his heavy-duty, expensive umbrella that he brought with him during the move from NYC. He has to dig it out of a taped-up packing box. He was not prepared to actually have need of the thing.
[23:37] <03tom> 14Tommy flips shut the burner and pockets it before heading into his ersatz living space in the basement. He takes a few moments to sip pensively at a triangular cut on today's bloodbag while he waits for the Uber.
01[23:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm trying to collect Invictus newbies like pokemon. The last guy I need to make contact with is Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna Beach..."
[23:39] <03tom> 14For Tommy, wardrobe is an easy choice: The hoodie gets to take another one for the team.
[23:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson sees "pokemon" in the Netflix browsing list sometimes. Some kind of animal cartoon? Japanese stuff. "I can set something up. What do you need?"
[23:40] <03Crion_> 4Over the turtleneck goes a trim black not-quite-leather jacket.
[23:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Just a number? A face to face?"
01[23:43] <03banana> 6KJ: "I dunno how well you know him? Real life would be great, but if it's out of your way I'm sure I could talk him into a meeting over the phone. Gotta ask him to join a club."
01[23:44] <03banana> 6Well. "At least, I've got to find out if he sucks and invite him if not."
[23:44] <03Crion_> 4We all suck.
[23:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I know him a little. Say, would you be willing to have a face-to-face meeting with him while doing something risky and of no material benefit to any of us?"
[23:46] <03tom> 14Tommy's stuffing shotshells into his pockets when his phone vibrates once to signal the arrival of the car.
[23:47] <03Crion_> 4Then Cav's out to the bar. He'll be the first to get there, probably, and he'll grab a table with good sightlines of the door before buying precisely one beer.
[23:47] <03Crion_> 4Lot of memories, in this place.
[23:47] <03Crion_> 4Thank god for being Gangrel.
01[23:48] <03banana> 6KJ: "Not.. ordinarily? But I want to impress him.. does that mean I'm the only one who'd benefit materially?"
01[23:48] <03banana> "I'm in."
[23:49] <03Quaker> The rain out here is enough to keep everyone home. And since most of Father’s regulars live on dirt roads, it’s enough of a challenge to even get there that they opt to drink in the comfort of their living rooms, instead. Until others arrive, Cav will just have the bartender for company. He’s happy to have a customer, and serves promptly, but the man is still as discreet and quiet as ever. 
[23:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I can swing by Anaheim and pick you up. We're headed out to the canyon. Probably want to come armed or at least be ready to Cloak." 
[23:50] <03Crion_> 4Smart man.
01[23:51] <03banana> "Right." 6If KJ hadn't met Wilson the way she had, she'd be asking more questions. And he probably wouldn't have offered whatever this is. Serendipity?
01[23:51] <03banana> 6The only thing she needs to know before ringing off- when's he going to be here?
[23:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm getting ready to go now. I'll be there inside an hour. I'll call when I'm close."
[23:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10After he's done with KJ, he'll ring Tommy personally. "I got us someone else. Valentine, outta Anaheim."
01[23:53] <03banana> "See you when you see me, Baron!" 6There might or might not be enough time to prepare for this.
[23:54] <03tom> 14Tommy is medium-soaked by the time he makes it to the bar and seats himself next to Cavanaugh with a polite nod. "Hey, great news. Vincent put out some feelers, and we got a guy and his plus-one. So that's four."
[23:55] <03tom> 14Tommy, thirty seconds previous, standing in the rain: "Fuck yes, you guys on your way?"
[23:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yep. See you in about an hour."
[23:55] <03Quaker> Twenty minutes later, KJ gets another call. “B-Baron Valentine? This is W-Wesley F-F-F-Fitzroy. Good to hear from you…w-would you be free tonight to chat? My working partner has called o-off, beastly cold and wet out there, dreadful conditions, really. I apologize f-for not calling back sooner.” 
[23:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav nods back. "You want a beer?"
[23:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson hangs up and shouts through the door. "NORA! MOUNT UP!"
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's hard to put armor on by yourself. S'why there were squires.
[23:57] <03tom> "You know I do."
[23:57] <03Crion_> 4Cav will signal the bartender for something cheap and domestic. It'll go on his tab.
[23:57] <03Crion_> "Who's your guy, and who's his plus one?"
01[23:58] <03banana> 6KJ's got her greatcoat on over a shirt and something too expensive to be called tracksuit pants, and she's halfway out the door when an employee with no sense of the occasion hands her the phone. Ah, well. "Baron Fitzroy, I'm glad you rang."
[23:58] <03tom> 14He sets down and the chair creaks beneath him. "Some Invictus guy, Wilson... Frost?"
[23:58] <03tom> "And someone named-" 14He makes air quotes. "Valentine."
[23:58] <03tom> 14He shrugs.
[23:58] <03tom> "It's better than I expected."
01[23:58] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm leaving in a few minutes to visit Laguna Beach about this same thing, so tonight's no good- any time after I'd be happy to catch up. What's your favourite form of media?"
[23:58] <03Crion_> 4Cav almost spit-takes into his beer. "Wilson Frost? Baron Hollywood?"
[23:59] <03Crion_> 4He laughs. "Oh this I gotta see."
[23:59] <03tom> "Dude says he has a fucking sword."
01[23:59] <03banana> "So far we've got opinions on film, novels and because we are who we are I think someone suggested the gramophone."
[23:59] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "No -- I mean yeah, he has a sword but -- okay, so the thing you need to understand about these old Invictus guys, is, like."
[23:59] <03Crion_> "They don't just have swords."
[23:59] <03Crion_> "They've got..."
Session Time: Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03tom> "Oh holy shit."
[00:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's over the shirt and then it's gone. In glass under museum lights, the sword hangs over a suit of armor. Neither belongs to him. Both are his now.
[00:00] <03Crion_> 4Cav pauses. "You know what? I'm not gonna say it."
[00:00] <03Crion_> "Let's just see what he's wearing, when he shows up."
[00:00] <03tom> "This is going to be so badass."
[00:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The armor stays where it is, but soon the sword's nowhere to be seen either.
[00:01] <03Quaker> Fitzroy: “F-face to f-face, I’m af-fraid. I’m less quick over the ph-ph-phone. Well, enjoy your time down on the c-coast. Drive safely.” 
01[00:02] <03banana> 6Ah. "Thanks, I won't keep you. Let's hope for tomorrow night."
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4Oh, another thing. They're obviously not with him here in the bar.
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4But Cav did bring the girls along.
[00:02] <03tom> "...And you don't need to bring anything, right? You just got those scary-ass, uh-" 14he makes a clawing motion.
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4They know the place pretty well.
[00:03] <03Crion_> "Yeah. If we run into any mortals, though, I've got this." 4Cav opens his jacket to flash the Glock. "Better than just breaking Masquerade."
[00:03] <03Crion_> "Still. Don't think that'll be a concern."
[00:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The only visible armament Baron Frost carries into the night is an umbrella. It's a long walk from the door to the driveway where Cora has the Lincoln idling. The heat's already cranked and the music's already going when Wilson says "Let's go."
[00:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBKFoeDKJo
[00:04] <03tom> "Man, that's the last thing we'd need."
[00:06] <03tom> 14He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. "Shotgun's riding a little high-there we go." 14He settles back into the chair.
[00:07] <03tom> "So uh, you ever seen these, y'know..." 14he raises his eyebrows conspiratorially. "Werewolves."
[00:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10KJ gets a warning when Wilson's five minutes out. Is she ready when the Lincoln rolls up?
01[00:09] <03banana> 6On the doorstop of an Anaheim townhouse - somewhere between a chocolate shop and a storage center with paint peeling off old brick - there's a woman in a grey greatcoat with hair curled back into a bun, fiddling with nothing.
01[00:09] <03banana> 6Which is to say, yes.
[00:09] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "The wild ones? Once or twice. Last time I was in the back of a pickup truck, holding an assault rifle, having just fled a nuclear reactor in the middle of a controlled meltdown, with the truck peeling out up the highway while big, dark shapes loped after us, snarling and howling."
[00:10] <03Crion_> "...Sounds a lot more badass and fun now than I could appreciate at the time."
01[00:11] <03banana> 6Nice car. KJ takes a photo as it rolls up, only partly for the plates.
[00:11] <03tom> "Do guns work? I thought it had to be silver."
[00:11] <03tom> "Is that like garlic?"
[00:11] <03tom> "Is everything bullshit?"
[00:12] <03Crion_> "Oh they don't work for shit."
[00:12] <03Crion_> "Like shooting them with rain. We just outran them."
[00:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10KJ and Wilson are headed off for Father's, then. Is there anything KJ wants to mention or ask before they get there?
[00:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's just sitting there looking out the window after he smiles and nods at her, an umbrella across his lap. He's wearing a suit with no tie and that sword's nowhere to be seen.
[00:13] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Valentine...do I know that name?"
01[00:13] <03banana> 6Are you asking whether KJ ever shuts up? Because no.
01[00:14] <03banana> "Heyy. This is a nice way to get out of the rain."
01[00:14] <03banana> "What's this guy like? Why's he getting into a fight?"
[00:14] <03Crion_> 4He fumbles around and pulls out his phone, then dives into his contacts directory. "Sounds like, I dunno, a dancer or something..."
[00:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "We're helping the Orange County Parish locate one of their own before law enforcement gets him. He's holed up out in feral country, our best information says. I'm doing a favor for the Parish, I understand for Baron Cavanaugh it's a jurisdictional thing."
[00:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You asking what Cavanaugh's like?"
[00:16] <03Crion_> 4It takes a minute or two of searching the directory, especially since he doesn't have a phone number, just a stub: "Oh. Baron Anaheim."
[00:16] <03Crion_> "Well, this is a high-ranking affair."
[00:17] <03tom> "What, three barons?"
01[00:17] <03banana> 6KJ: "Right. I'm starting a new barons' club - no offense to present company - and I've got one last pokeball here. Do you know if he's into films?"
[00:17] <03tom> "And a Deacon."
01[00:17] <03banana> 6Well, there should be a man of God in any good posse.
01[00:20] <03banana> 6Ferals. Does that mean unaligned vampires who don't respect the Court? Or does it mean..
[00:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You know, I don't. I bet he likes them fine but there's not many true cinephiles in the Court. I bet he'd be agreeable enough if he isn't busy. His reputation's a little overblown."
01[00:21] <03banana> 6But look, she's the one who knows what pokemon are in this conversation. There's an information equality.
01[00:22] <03banana> 6KJ: "OK, worth a try. Yuan is trying to argue me around to the idea of a bookclub, but I don't know if bookshops actually exist anymore?"
01[00:22] <03banana> 6KJ: "I feel really shitty talking about a club you're not invited to though. Change of subject. I hope by ferals you don't mean freaking werewolves?"
[00:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson leans back a little, eyes closed. "Witches and wolves."
[00:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're visiting a dead man's house. I remember hearing the story of what became of old Thomas Franks last fall. One of the Orange deputies came and told us all a story about it."
01[00:24] <03banana> 6KJ does a thing with her mouth that looks exactly like :/. Maybe he can't see it. 
01[00:25] <03banana> "I don't really like ghost stories."
[00:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Doolittle, I think his name was. Haven't heard much of him lately. Cavanaugh's the only one out of that set who made a name for himself. Cavanaugh got his promotion, Santiago got a better gig. I don't know the rest of them. Maybe they went down with Seabury."
01[00:26] <03banana> "I've met Santiago. He's living it up with a hot wife in the lap of luxury."
[00:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Poor damn dumb Seabury. Just ambitious enough to go down." 10Ah, Wilson's already drunk. "Like I said. Better gig. Speaking of cinephiles, for my money Tess is the only person in the Court who really appreciates the form."
03[00:28] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-t5p.nlu.215.117.IP)
01[00:29] <03banana> 6! "Tess Okienka? She seems like a very intelligent woman. Really struck me as.. what's the best way to put this. The first person I've met in the Brilliant Court who understands both what she want and the cost of having it."
[00:29] <03Crion_> 4Cav, to Tommy: "You fought in the San Diego war, right?"
[00:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not a lot of people in LA feel like they belong here. Tess settled in a good way."
[00:30] <03tom> "I cut my teeth. You?"
[00:30] <03Crion_> "I had a...special assignment."
[00:31] <03Crion_> "The sort where you get dropped from a helicopter into a San Diego skyscraper."
[00:31] <03Crion_> "Yes, they have a few."
[00:32] <03Crion_> "And then you spend the rest of the night swimming up the Pacific Coast to avoid -- you know what, I was wrong. The reactor was the second to last time I ran away from werewolves."
01[00:32] <03banana> "Hmm." 6Is there a good way to do that? To settle? "You know, I appreciate these crash courses in Personalities Of L.A. The Stars as seen from Agartha."
[00:32] <03tom> "No shit?" 14Tommy is still working on his beer. He's hit the stage where he's painfully aware that he's not getting anything out of it and in an hour or two it'll have to come back up, but is too committed to back down regardless.
[00:32] <03Crion_> "The last time was when Administrator Seabury died, and I threw myself off a cliff into the ocean and swam twenty miles to get away from them."
[00:33] <03Crion_> "I was already down some blood from the fight in the executive suite of...whatever that building was."
[00:33] <03Crion_> "Had a cute receptionist."
[00:33] <03tom> 14He lets a healthy silence accrue before breaking it: "You know I said it before but all you Invictus guys are fucking crazy."
[00:33] <03Crion_> "That's how I spent the war, though," 4Cav says, finishing the beer. "Special operations."
[00:34] <03Crion_> 4He laughs. "Yeah? What's that shotgun loaded with?"
[00:34] <03Crion_> "It catch fire?"
[00:35] <03tom> "I mean, if I stuffed it in my mouth and pulled the trigger it wouldn't matter."
[00:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Knowing people is the only really good work left to us. In my opinion."
[00:35] <03tom> "I still wouldn't jump outta a helicopter."
[00:36] <03Crion_> "I'm just saying. You get to where we are in the world we live in, there's a lot of crazy, of a lot of different kinds, to go around."
01[00:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "I think it's vital. I don't think it would be enough, though."
[00:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Me neither."
[00:36] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Anyway my main question was, can these two fight?"
01[00:37] <03banana> 6KJ: "I get the joke! Inadequate and the only thing available. Anyway, that's obviously wrong but I'll let it slide."
[00:37] <03tom> "Wilson seems to think he can. Dunno about 'Valentine'."
[00:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I appreciate that."
[00:38] <03tom> "I guess we'll find out."
01[00:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "There are a lot of people worth knowing here. It's surprising."
[00:38] <03Crion_> 4Cav stands and walks over to pay out the tab as a Lincoln pulls into the parking lot.
01[00:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "Baron- there's someone who found it appalling. Haha."
[00:38] <03Crion_> "Guess we'll find out soon enough."
[00:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson, abruptly: "I think we're here. You want the umbrella?"
01[00:39] <03banana> 6KJ: "The idea, I mean, that there are a lot of good people in these parts, even if they can be frustrating at times, was appalling to someone I met, is what I intended to say. Christ."
01[00:39] <03banana> "Nah, the rain won't see me."
[00:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, you're gonna meet one more before we're done here."
[00:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He grabs the umbrella. "Let's meet the rest of the posse."
[00:40] <03Crion_> 4Cav will be leaning against the wall in the antechamber when they walk in, having already settled up.
[00:41] <03Crion_> 4He's not entirely sure what they'll be wearing, and the bartender doesn't need to see the old man decked out in full plate if that's how he--
01[00:42] <03banana> 6As KJ gets out of Wilson's car she's almost beginning to glow, visibly becoming the center of attention as the arc of the social universe bends.
[00:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A little man walks in under an umbrella, and when it comes down and closes Baron Hollywood is leaning on it in some funhouse mirror riff on Fred Astaire, wearing a suit with no tie and plain black boots under the slacks. He raises his eyebrows at Cavanaugh and mouths, small world.
[00:42] <03Crion_> 4Awwww.
[00:42] <03tom> 14Tommy joins him and just sort-of slouches in place like a pile of mud slowly sinking into the lowest possible point on a surface.
[00:43] <03Crion_> 4The disappointment(?) doesn't reach Cav's face though. He just smiles and reaches out a hand. He looks less sleepy than he usually does when he smiles now; no sqiunting, his eyes fully open, engaged and alert.
[00:43] <03Crion_> "Baron Hollywood."
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson shakes back. "Baron Laguna. Do you know Baron Anaheim?"
[00:45] <03Crion_> 4Cavanaugh: "I haven't had the pleasure."
01[00:46] <03banana> 6There's a beat before a woman joins them, stepping out of a gust of rain on the last syllable of her title. She's also carrying no weaponry, except for her smile, which should probably count.
01[00:46] <03banana> http://i.imgur.com/ygHVlTR.jpg
[00:46] <03Crion_> 4Wow. Huh. He extends a hand to her. "And it is a pleasure."
01[00:46] <03banana> "I know you, though. From public arguments!"
01[00:46] <03banana> "So it is, Baron."
[00:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Damn. Well anyway, this must be Tommy. Wilson offers him a hand. "Deacon. Wilson Frost. Pleasure."
[00:47] <03tom> 14The Deacon is a pallid man in jeans and a grey hoodie. His complexion is cratered and waxen. He takes the offered handshake, but his is limp. "Glad to have ya."
[00:47] <03Crion_> http://i.imgur.com/qeElcSE.jpg
01[00:48] <03banana> 6Deacon _______ gets the same smile without the same handshake. "Hey, every good posse needs a man of God."
[00:48] <03tom> "I'm Tommy. Nice to meet you, uh. Valentine?"
[00:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Deacon Saldana, meet Baron Valentine, of Anaheim. You know there's a lyrical quality to that title I hadn't noticed before."
[00:49] <03tom> "That's one way to remember."
01[00:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's why they picked it. Call me KJ, guys."
[00:50] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "And you can call me Cav."
[00:50] <03Crion_> "Let's step out onto the landing." 4Surely Father's has a covered landing.
[00:52] <03Quaker> Well, it’s a long covered wooden porch, but yes. It runs along the length of the front of the bar. 
[00:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To block the sun if nothing else. Wilson's out there with the rest of them.
[00:52] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "First off, thanks to both of you for coming out on such short notice."
01[00:52] <03banana> 6This guy's aura is interesting. Similar enough to KJ that it doesn't make her want to cower, particularly, or to destroy him - which has been more of a thing recently. The others have of course been polite enough to suppress their raw predatory natures, which seems to be de rigeur in L.A.
[00:53] <03Crion_> "...You do know what you've signed up for here, right?"
01[00:53] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm actually here about a bookclub, but I'm here to help first. If you'll listen afterward!"
[00:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The old Franks estate, yeah? Looking for Souza."
[00:53] <03tom> 14Tommy picks up where Cav drops off. "Show of hands, who knew that werewolves were a thing before yesterday?" 14He doesn't raise his hand.
[00:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Tommy: "Hey. Far as you know, we're just making 'em up to scare you."
[00:54] <03Crion_> 4He pauses. "A bookclub...yeah, I could see myself interested in that. I mean. Gangrel and all, but. I take good notes."
[00:54] <03Crion_> 4To Wilson: "Oh, no. He met Joanie last night."
01[00:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "I learned it the easy way coming down from SF. Nearly became the hard way." 6She smiles at Cav again.
[00:54] <03tom> "I doubt most of them are gonna be that cute."
[00:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "You don't want to get close enough to find out."
[00:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Anyway, werewolves maybe aren't the real problem."
[00:55] <03Crion_> "Anyone here ever heard of a guy by name of Jubal?"
[00:55] <03tom> "Right, I mean, I was just making a point-"
01[00:55] <03banana> 6Yeah, apparently, we need to find someone? Oh..
[00:55] <03tom> "Nnno."
01[00:56] <03banana> "Is that the man from Orange parish?"
[00:56] <03Crion_> "Jubal's an Acolyte. Got a Satan goatee, a bad sense of humor, a real big cult, and he can turn into...well, into something like a werewolf, but it can fly."
[00:56] <03Crion_> "We met him last year. At the Franks estate."
[00:57] <03Crion_> "He killed Edgar Doolittle there, though it took a couple months for it to take."
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's one of the Hierophants. The high priests."
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh, is that what happened to Doolittle? That's a shame.
01[00:57] <03banana> 6KJ: "Just to clarify, this is Franks as in 'when I heard what happened to Tommy Franks, I-'"?
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Man could spin a story.
[00:57] <03Crion_> "The same."
01[00:58] <03banana> 6KJ: "Wao."
[00:58] <03tom> "We're not gonna stay long," 14Tommy quickly adds in hopes of not immediately scaring off their allies.
[00:59] <03tom> "We're just gonna get in there, yell at Sponger 'till he comes out, then bundle him back to Mission Viejo."
[00:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I wonder what happened to his mountain lions."
[00:59] <03Crion_> 4Cav grins. "You know, Wilson, funny story about that."
[00:59] <03tom> "Hopefully we don't even see anybody..." 14he wails.
01[00:59] <03banana> "Sure, even better if they don't see us."
[00:59] <03Crion_> 4He steps off the porch into the rain and whistles twice, loud and harsh.
[01:00] <03Crion_> 4Two mountain lions stalk out of the darkness beyond the parking lot and pause at the edge of the light.
[01:01] <03Crion_> "Barons and Deacon, meet Shots and Honey Tree Evil Eye. Girls, meet the posse."
[01:01] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I'm kind of a cat person, and I wasn't just going to leave them up there."
[01:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Well I'll be damned." 10To the Deacon: "No offense."
01[01:01] <03banana> 6KJ takes a step back, to be honest. "Kitties,", she murmurs, but very quietly. 
[01:02] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Now, if we do run into Jubal, I've got this." 4Once he steps back under the overhang, he pulls out...a flashlight.
[01:02] <03Crion_> "Doesn't look like much, but Rollie Choi used it to set the bastard on fire last Halloween."
[01:03] <03Crion_> "Still, we'd be better off just. Not running into him."
[01:03] <03tom> "None taken- are we taking the panthers with us?"
01[01:03] <03banana> "A decent Plan A. Is there any chance Mr. Souza will have connected with these people, in a way which doesn't obviate our mission?"
[01:04] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "They'll run parallel to us. They're faster on their own, anyway, and more comfortable as a surprise. They know the land well, too."
[01:04] <03tom> "We know he hung out with Joanie, at least."
[01:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Hopefully he's not that desperate," 10says Wilson, unhopefully.
01[01:05] <03banana> "Joanie?"
01[01:05] <03banana> 6KJ needs to know the people involved to be any use here. She's not going toe to toe with a werewolf.
[01:06] <03tom> "I guess she's one of them?" 14Tommy sorta-shrugs-sorta-doesn't.
[01:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Laguna's resident werewolf."
[01:06] <03Crion_> 4He considered, and rejected, using the phrase 'model minority.'
01[01:07] <03banana> 6KJ: "Okay. So if Souza turns out to have taken sanctuary with the witches or the werewolves, how will that affect our priorities?"
[01:09] <03Crion_> 4Cav looks to Tommy. This is more a question for him.
[01:09] <03Quaker> In the pouring rain, visibility has been reduced to nearly zero. They can see a car coming slowly up the road, windshield wipers traversing the windshield furiously, until it turns and slides onto the muddy ground of the parking lot in front of them. KJ and Cav might know the former deputy who kills the engine and steps out, arm raised to keep water out of his eyes. “I”ll take yours back to the house?” Santiago is asking Cav. A Land 
[01:09] <03Quaker> Rover for a luxury sedan seems like a good trade if you need to get somewhere that’s not paved. 
[01:10] <03Crion_> 4Our ride.
01[01:10] <03banana> 6Actually, it was rhetorical. "This is the guy you were talking about at the ballet. So it's the Parish obligated to produce him, Baron Laguna is helping out, and we're helping him in turn. Heck, I'm happy to help you directly, Deacon. Just need to get it out there that there's some line after what we produce would be: an excuse."
[01:11] <03Crion_> "Sounds good, Santiago. Thanks again for doing this."
01[01:11] <03banana> "Likely consequences: Souza gets declared a traitor by the Judex and added to next spring's festivities. It's not Plan A."
[01:11] <03tom> "Wellll."
01[01:11] <03banana> "But it wouldn't mean, like, the end of Orange or anything. These things happen, or, hopefully, don't."
[01:11] <03Crion_> 4To KJ: "Well, Baron Anaheim, if Souza is shacked up with the Circle and has a permanent residence at the Franks estate, that means the Circle is claiming territory with a traitorous proxy."
[01:12] <03Crion_> "And that means this becomes officially someone else's problem."
[01:12] <03Crion_> "Perhaps everyone else's problem."
[01:12] <03tom> "Yeah. I'm not up on Invictus policy, here, so don't get me wrong-"
[01:12] <03Quaker> Santiago ducks into the shelter of the covered porch, and waits for his betters to let him get a word in. “No problem. Hey, you know Wesley Fitzroy, right? Baron of, uh…Yorba Linda? New baron, I mean.” 
[01:12] <03tom> "But that seems like something that we would want to discourage."
01[01:12] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yes! Hi again, Mr. Santiago."
[01:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Evening. He's the nervous one, right?"
[01:13] <03tom> "I'm honestly fine with turning my ass a hundred-eighty degrees and just walking away if that happens. Not my department."
[01:14] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I agree with the Deacon. If there's a Circle base in there, the appropriate response involves full plate mail and helicopters, not the four of us."
[01:14] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "What's up, Santiago?"
01[01:15] <03banana> 6KJ: "(Parenthetically, we're gonna try to make sure it doesn't go that far. Just saying.)"
[01:16] <03Quaker> Santiago: “Hi, Baron. We had him over for dinner last night. Not nervous, no. Just has a stutter. Well, he was out here with ‘Tin Garcia a couple times the last few weeks, looking for something. Didn’t say what it was. Just…well, actually, he was nervous about that. Which struck me as weird, because those guys are pretty sanguine about the Circle. I got the feeling it wasn’t really the Circle that had him spooked about coming out 
[01:16] <03Quaker> here. Didn’t talk too much about it after that. Figured I should tell you to keep your eyes peeled for…well, anything, I guess.” 
[01:17] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Man."
[01:17] <03Crion_> "This place is becoming a bit too popular for my liking."
01[01:19] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hmmmmmmmmm."
[01:19] <03Quaker> Santiago: “Yeah. No neighbors was kind of the appeal of living out here. Anyway, I gotta get back. Stay safe. No service farther up the canyon, but I’ll keep an eye on my phone anyway. Later.” He trots off into the rain, and Cav’s car backs up out of the lot and down the road, fading away into the water and darkness. 
[01:20] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Stay safe. And take the Lexus out for a drive, if you want."
[01:20] <03tom> 14Tommy slips on his earbuds and cranks his music.
01[01:20] <03banana> 6By the end of this utterance she's basically got no upper lip visible. Hmmm. "Weeks? He wasn't looking for Souza."
[01:21] <03Crion_> "Lot of mysteries around the old Franks' estate. Wonder precisely where he was searching." 4He'll slip behind the wheel of the Range Rover. "So here's how I see this working. I'll drive us in slow. No lights."
[01:23] <03tom> 14Tommy slides smoothly into the backseat and rubs his hands.
[01:24] <03Crion_> "Tommy, if you want to get out and walk alongside us once we get close -- use us as a stalking horse -- that might work well."
[01:24] <03tom> "I can swing that."
01[01:25] <03banana> 6KJ: "Alright. Actually, let me just try something."
[01:25] <03Crion_> 4Cav whistles Shots and Honey over again and whispers into their ears for a second or two.
[01:25] <03tom> "I wanna make something clear though, I'm not gonna start blasting at anybody if there's a chance we can make it out of this without having to go toe-to-toe with these people."
[01:25] <03Crion_> 4Then to Tommy: "Once you get out, Shots and Honey will cover you."
[01:25] <03Crion_> "Yeah, that's the smart play."
01[01:25] <03banana> 6Before getting into the Land Rover, KJ circles it briefly - without getting too close to, who was it, Shots and Party Rock Anthem? She lays a hand on the warm bonnet.
[01:26] <03tom> "Okay. I'll try not to shoot your cats."
[01:26] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Thank you."
[01:26] <03tom> 14Like he or any asshole can tell the difference between a cat and a wolf in this weather.
[01:27] <03tom> 14At that moment, Tommy became at peace with the fact that he would inevitably get the shit mauled out of him.
[01:27] <03Crion_> 4Then the car...what happens to the car?
01[01:29] <03banana> 6No running lights. No running anything. Shame KJ couldn't feed before she left, but she's still got the good shit circulating.. She calls deeply on the Blood. This is what was worth leaving stock options behind.
01[01:29] <03banana> 6The Mekhet completes her circle, turns into the light, away from- was there something there?"Probably better if I drive?"
[01:30] <03Crion_> 4Cav shakes his head. "Still surprising to me sometimes, the shit you can do with the power of the blood."
[01:30] <03Crion_> 4He gestures. "Go right ahead."
[01:31] <03tom> 14When Wilson opens the door, Tommy pats the empty seat next to him.
01[01:31] <03banana> 6KJ grins widely, very different from the hundred watt smile earlier. More manic, not quite so impressive, but real. "Here's the front seat- watch your step."
[01:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson sits a little awkwardly. Tommy can't really tell why.
01[01:32] <03banana> "Santiago Canyon, isn't it?"
[01:33] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "So from the outside are we just...hovering in the air?"
[01:34] <03tom> "Is it a sword? Do you have an invisible sword?"
[01:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's misdirection, not a hologram. They won't be looking at the car at all.
[01:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Tommy: "Yes."
[01:35] <03tom> 14Tommy gestures over his shoulder. "Hell yeah, my man. Ever see Terminator 2?"
[01:35] <03Quaker> From the outside…there’s no outside, or inside. The Land Rover just becomes another indistinct shape in the rain, identical to a distant tree or curve in the hills. 
[01:35] <03Crion_> 4Still weird.
01[01:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah, nobody looks inside. That's why you keep looking at each other - the leather and metal are still *here* but I won't allow them to matter. Please don't shoot a gun out the window or the flashlight- might be a clue to people with the right kind of eyes."
01[01:36] <03banana> 6She's sitting somewhere as she says this, holding something wheel-like. Not clear what it might be, though! Best to think about other things.
[01:39] <03Quaker> Even in clearer weather (the night was clear and cold the last time Cav was here), the drive would take a while, especially past the bend in the road where the road turns from smooth asphalt and concrete to loose dust and dirt. Now, the rain has turned the whole thing into an avenue of tightly-packed mud, the Rover’s heavy tires leaving deep grooves as they inch forward, feeling it every time the tires grasp for a grip and then find it. 
[01:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson does a pretty good Schwarzenegger. "Your foster parents are dead."
[01:39] <03Crion_> 4It was a dark and stormy night...
[01:40] <03tom> 14He raises his hand to his mouth in mock secrecy. "I got dead ringer for Arnold's shotgun taped to my back."
[01:41] <03Quaker> The rain pound unceasingly on the roof, the sides, the windshield - it’s almost impossible to see more than fifty feet in front of anything. The car’s lights illuminate things in turn - trees, fences, empty hills fenced off for horses but containing nothing. Even without seeing it, they can feel the trees grow closer to the road, stepping into the space where shoulders and signs would be, branches and boughs spreading out above them to 
[01:41] <03Quaker> block the moonlight. 
01[01:41] <03banana> "Shit, we've angered the gods."
[01:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Nice. Let's hope we never see it."
[01:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Out here, these gods are always angry. Not our fault."
[01:41] <03tom> "Well, yeah. S'pretty badass though," 14Tommy grumbles.
[01:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's the worst part about hunting season. We're always rooting not to have any fun."
01[01:43] <03banana> 6To Cav: "You're from New York, right? They have anything between snow and sunlight?"
[01:43] <03Quaker> An hour later, they arrive. 
[01:44] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Wind. And garbage."
[01:44] <03tom> "Shit, New York. Fuck, knew it. You're all crazy."
01[01:46] <03banana> "Is 'you' the Invictus, Saldana? Dude, I have a file on all us new barons. For hopefully a bookclub. It's basically a catalog of crazy."
01[01:47] <03banana> "Did you know that out of eight people, there are four who haven't been sentenced to death in some jurisdiction? That's going to be an icebreaker."
[01:47] <03Quaker> The wind blows in this place in a way that the worst of the driving wind and rain is directed just past the grand, ruined house, so that they can see its outline loom suddenly out of the weather. As the lights of the car turn onto it, three of them will see a rotting, crumbling edifice, columns cracked and leaning, windows fallen out of their frames, the patio and front eaves marked with dirt and mud and grime that no one has been around to 
[01:47] <03Quaker> clean. 
[01:48] <03Crion_> 4Cav wracks his brain. "Wait, which four am I part of?"
[01:48] <03Quaker> Cav will know that it looks even more forgotten and fallen than the last time. There are certainly more holes in it. 
[01:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson reaches for his flask. Every day is Halloween.
[01:48] <03tom> 14He ignores KJ's remark. "What is this Edgar Allen Poe shit."
[01:48] <03Quaker> There aren’t any cars or people to be seen. 
[01:48] <03Crion_> 4He'll whistle long and low when the 'estate' comes into view. "Hopefully he's not down in the tunnels."
01[01:48] <03banana> 6This doesn't look inhabited. "This doesn't look inhabited."
[01:48] <03tom> "There's fucking tunnels?"
[01:48] <03Crion_> "...Yeah. There are tunnels underneath."
[01:50] <03tom> 14He contains whatever it was he was about to say. It comes out as a muffled, guttural groan as he steps out of the car.
[01:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We should get Morton out here to paint this. Put him up in a trailer or something. Get a dozen different lightings like Monet at Rouens."
[01:50] <03tom> "Well let's get this shitshow on the road."
[01:50] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "And then we should burn this place to the ground."
[01:50] <03Crion_> "More trouble than it's worth."
[01:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Think of how haunted the next house'll be, though."
[01:50] <03tom> "He's almost certainly in the tunnels."
[01:51] <03Crion_> "Yep." 4Is there at least a makeshift garage area for them to park?
01[01:51] <03banana> "Yeah, I've been meaning to ask. Morton Moreno Munoz is on my list, but isn't he oldschool..? Ah, not the time."
[01:51] <03Quaker> There was a garage. Its roof has collapsed in, meaning that whatever space used to be inside is now occupied by sodden debris. 
01[01:51] <03banana> 6KJ will pull up somewhere that nothing's actually going to fall onto the car, that'll have to do. Not like it'll be stolen.
[01:51] <03tom> "Think like Sponger," 14he mutters to himself. Ghhuhh, I'm gonna fuck up killing Cosmo Morgan and be as much of a pain in the ass to Tommy as I can. Miles of underground tunnels? Where do I sign?
[01:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson thinks, I love heresy and hate indoor heating.
[01:52] <03Crion_> 4Honey and Shots stalk out of the darkness.
[01:52] <03Crion_> "Good news, Tommy."
[01:53] <03Crion_> "I'm gonna have the girls check out the tunnels."
[01:53] <03Crion_> "They used to live down there."
01[01:53] <03banana> 6KJ knows nothing about Sponger Souza. She's just happy to be here! Actually, she's thinking about the best time to introduce the topic of mutual follows.
[01:53] <03Crion_> "We won't have to go down there if we don't have to."
01[01:53] <03banana> "Huh- how did they manage to survive? Poor Shots and Party Rock."
[01:53] <03tom> "Man, if I have to go to Soria all like 'well we found Sponger, but he got mauled to death by a pair of mountain lions'...."
[01:54] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "The girls know what they're doing."
[01:54] <03tom> "Yeah, yeah..."
[01:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's gotta be safer with the lions than with us."
[01:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You can reason with a lion."
[01:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're incorrigible."
[01:55] <03Crion_> "They're not just smart. They're my ghouls."
[01:56] <03Crion_> "They're not going to go around mauling Sponger Souza."
01[01:56] <03banana> 6KJ: "Nice builtin pun." 6She's looking for something to sit on, but there's just the wrecked old house.
[01:56] <03Crion_> 4Honey and Shots slink off.
01[01:57] <03banana> "Honestly it might be more congenial to hide under a rock."
01[01:59] <03banana> 6After a moment: "..shall we go in? Time waits for nobody."
[02:00] <03Crion_> 4Cav has been staring at the facade, and the front lawn, for some reason. "...Yeah. Yeah, let's do this."
01[02:01] <03banana> "If I had time powers, I would've said 'time waits for no man really meaningfully'."
[02:02] <03tom> 14Tommy pulls his hood up over his head and jogs up to the building.
[02:05] <03Quaker> The rotting facade has been punctured by the elements too many time to offer any shelter. The porch is strewn with the mild refuse of nature, but nothing else. It’s not until they get into the main entry hall that they find someplace out of the rain. Well, half out of it. The roof here has buckled inwards, broken beams and tiling sloping down so that a few fountains pour down, framed against the light of the moon that comes down in shafts. 
[02:05] <03Quaker> The leftovers of someone’s life has spilled out in every direction. Overturned furniture, piles of molding clothes, books made illegible by water and animals. 
[02:05] <03Quaker> Three of them realize that one of the lumpish piles scattered across the tiled floor is not quite like the others. In fact, it’s left its own blood trail. 
[02:06] <03tom> 14Gross.
[02:06] <03Quaker> Wilson doesn’t notice it. He can only see the blonde woman looking down at him from the staircase. 
[02:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anyone he knows?
[02:06] <03Crion_> 4Hooboy.
[02:06] <03Quaker> Baron Laura Palmer looks the same as she did when she died, more than thirty years ago. 
[02:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10oh
01[02:07] <03banana> 6KJ's going to approach the.. pile, on edge. Any movement and she's probably never been here.
[02:07] <03Quaker> She’s walked away from the railing, into another room, by the time any of them move towards the body. 
[02:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks at the others. Does anyone else see or react to this?
[02:08] <03Quaker> They did not see her. There was nothing to see, as far as they were concerned. 
[02:08] <03Crion_> 4Cav looks back at Wilson. "Something up?"
[02:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "saw a ghost"
[02:10] <03tom> "Great."
[02:10] <03tom> 14Tommy kneels by the body. Human?
[02:10] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Someone you knew?"
01[02:10] <03banana> 6KJ: "'No neighbours' indeed. Franks could've used some to keep an eye on this place.."
01[02:11] <03banana> 6She's there with Tommy - the deacon Tommy, not dead Tommy Franks- but she'll let him do the looking.
[02:11] <03Quaker> The pile doesn’t move, even when KJ  and Tommy move to its side. The black robe, stitched crudely with angular animal patterns in rough white string. might be familiar to her. The hand-carved wooden mask, strangely blank except for two eye holes and a jagged aperture carved out where a mouth would be, feels faintly unpleasant to look at. 
[02:11] <03Crion_> 4...Cultists?
[02:11] <03Crion_> 4Jubal's?
[02:11] <03Quaker> None of them recognize the man under it. Cav would recognize the robe and the mask as belonging to the Circle. 
[02:12] <03Crion_> 4Same as the guys on Halloween?
[02:12] <03Quaker> Yes. 
[02:12] <03Crion_> "This is one of Jubal's guys," 4Cav says quietly.
[02:12] <03Crion_> "Well. Was."
[02:13] <03tom> "Well, I'm no expert but I think this home might be occupied by the bad guys from Wicker Man."
[02:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson will approach the stairs. Where'd she go?
01[02:13] <03banana> 6KJ: "What do you call a dead witch in a haunted house?"
[02:13] <03Quaker> Cause of (second) death is pretty obvious - a massive skull fracture and other traumatic blunt injuries. There’s no indication that he died cleanly from some sort of weapon. 
01[02:14] <03banana> 6She's not looking closely. There's no point- she doesn't know anatomy. The blood is.. well, it's not the time for that, haha!
[02:14] <03Crion_> 4To KJ: "Mixed metaphor."
[02:14] <03Quaker> Laura went into the second door on the right. There’s only two doors on either side on the second floor hall. 
[02:14] <03tom> 14He tries to humor this: "I dunno, what."
01[02:14] <03banana> "Wilson, let's stick together." 6Leaving the joke unfinished, KJ jogs up the stairs.
01[02:15] <03banana> 6(If that's where he's going.)
[02:15] <03Crion_> 4To be clear, this guy's dead, right? Not in torpor? Final Death? From blunt force trauma?
[02:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It is. 
[02:15] <03Crion_> 4Good lord that's a long, unpleasant way to die.
[02:15] <03Quaker> Dead. 
[02:16] <03tom> 14The Deacon sighs and prods the corpse with his shoe. "Shouldn't this guy be dust?"
[02:17] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Guess the robes and where he's been left is just out of the sun."
[02:18] <03Quaker> The second door on the right leads into the library. The roof hasn’t broken here, but the books aren’t much better off. Every shelf has been turned over, every book scattered onto the floor. Some survived, others are torn or soaked with some sort of mixture of dirt and water. 
[02:19] <03Quaker> There’s an unlit fireplace, and some overturned and shredded armchairs. 
[02:19] <03Crion_> 4To be honest, Cav, Rollie, and Edgar might be responsible for some of that.
[02:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks around. Any sign of- of anything?
[02:20] <03Quaker> Nothing moving. 
[02:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anything not? Something she- something that whatever that was might've been drawn to or led us to?
[02:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll poke around unless someone living or dead grabs his attention.
[02:21] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Sponger never struck me" 4haha "as the kind of guy who'd beat someone to death like this, but between this and Cosmo Morgan, maybe Souza's changed."
[02:21] <03tom> 14Tommy stands up and looks around for a sheet or something to throw over the body.
01[02:21] <03banana> 6KJ: "No ghosts here. Did you see the sort of specter you'd expect of someone using telepresence, or something more, uh, occult than gothic?"
[02:22] <03tom> "It'd be a pretty bad idea to put the boots to a Crone out here."
[02:22] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Wish I knew how long he'd been here."
[02:22] <03Crion_> "Seems improbable they'd just...let this go."
[02:22] <03tom> "We should probably get outta here before one of them shows up and wants an explanation. This is not a good look."
[02:23] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Yeah. Shouldn't take much longer to search the rest of the house."
[02:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Didn't look like a specter at all."
[02:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is there nothing? No other exit?
[02:27] <03Crion_> 4On impulse to Tommy: "Don't cover the body."
01[02:27] <03banana> 6KJ will follow Frost into the room but not interfere. What is he looking for. "Are you ok? You really saw something, didn't you."
[02:27] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Nicety like that, they'll know someone with dignity and respect for the dead was here."
[02:27] <03Crion_> "Don't need to point fingers back at the Court more than we have to."
01[02:27] <03banana> 6KJ will follow Frost into the room but not interfere. What is he looking for? "Are you ok? You really saw something, didn't you."
[02:28] <03Quaker> Wilson rummages through the library’s scattered contents. The late lord Franks certainly had an eclectic eye - midcentury German postwar literature, 20s Argentine futurism, medieval nominalist philosophy in the untranslated Latin, older Gnostic texts in the untranslated Greek and Syriac. Not first editions, just obscure anthologies and collections. 
[02:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's shoulders sag. Is that it?
[02:29] <03Quaker> It’s almost by accident that he realizes this portion of the room he’s standing in has a different type of wood paneling under the rugs laid out on the floor. And that his feet make a slightly different sound when he steps on the planks. 
[02:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Forget it. Looks like-" 10His footsteps creak. "Huh."
[02:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Help me get this rug up."
[02:30] <03tom> 14Tommy squints at Cavanaugh, then sets down the sheet.
[02:30] <03tom> "...Yeah, you're right."
01[02:30] <03banana> 6KJ: "Sure." 6She won't even ask why, but she'll watch closely.
[02:30] <03tom> "Sucks though. I'd give last rites if I were a priest, and if it wouldn't probably piss them off even worse."
[02:31] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I once put my thumbs in the eyes of a guy wearing a mask like this, and twisted his head clean off."
[02:31] <03tom> 14He raises his hand over the body and raises two fingers. "I hope you weren't an asshole."
[02:31] <03Crion_> "It was because he was being an asshole."
[02:31] <03Crion_> "To put it mildly."
[02:31] <03Quaker> The rugs are trashed by the weather that’s been let in, but they roll up nicely. Beneath, there’s a groove between the panels on the floor. Someone’s repeated pulling there has enlarged it into something you could stick your thumb in. 
[02:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Up it comes.
01[02:33] <03banana> 6KJ: "I can't believe the successive ransackers and halloween specials missed this."
[02:33] <03Crion_> 4Did we? Cav can't recall how precisely they got down to the tunnels last time.
[02:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There's always more," 10says Wilson as he pries up most of the floor one-handed. "And it's always worse."
[02:33] <03Crion_> 4Also, a trap door on the second floor?
[02:34] <03Crion_> 4Long way down.
01[02:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "The Kaiser Chiefs." 6She's got her phone out, recording video. It's invisible, though.
[02:35] <03Quaker> Wilson rips off the planks to reveal a small passageway, now missing a portion of its roof, trailing into the dark as it heads towards the hall. There’s enough space for a person to scoot along on their belly. 
01[02:35] <03banana> 6The trick to this sort of thing is hand motions, positioning of your body in ways that would be natural if you weren't holding the knife - or smartphone, in this case. 
01[02:36] <03banana> 6In an age before computers, KJ likes to think she would have been a magician.
[02:38] <03Quaker> Cav’s cats emerge noiselessly from the direction of the kitchen. Nothing living or moving down in the tunnels bigger than a rat. Even the room that the two diggers had set up has been stripped clean. 
[02:38] <03Crion_> 4Cav will wander upstairs and check the other rooms, after poking his head in on the two Barons. "Cats say our boy isn't in the tunnels."
[02:38] <03tom> "Shit."
[02:38] <03Crion_> 4Tommy will be happy to hear it.
[02:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Found a crawl space."
[02:39] <03tom> "Gah!"
[02:39] <03tom> 14Tommy stomps up the stairs.
[02:39] <03Crion_> 4He'll give Shots and Honey a couple scritches, then send them out front to watch the car.
[02:40] <03tom> "Well, if he's not in the tunnels, then he's gotta be hidden out in there, or else not here."
[02:40] <03Crion_> "Someone's definitely been down there, though. Place has been stripped clean."
[02:40] <03Quaker> The other doors upstairs lead to: a bathroom, now mildewed and with broken tile, a…some kind of office-room, now too destroyed by the rain let in by the broken ceiling to figure out its purpose (it’s empty, anyway), and a - hey, this isn’t a door at all. 
[02:40] <03tom> "It's not like Souza would hide from me, right?" 14He asks pointedly at an empty corner of the room just in case.
02[02:41] * Quits: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-t5p.nlu.215.117.IP) (Client exited)
[02:41] <03Crion_> 4...Not a door?
[02:41] <03Quaker> The second “door” on the left is actually more like a slab of metal. There’s no give if Cav pushes on it. 
[02:41] <03Quaker> It’s set in the door-frame, though. 
[02:41] <03Crion_> 4Huh.
01[02:41] <03banana> 6KJ moves to the door to chat, though she's still keeping an electric eye on the crawlspace discovery. No need to mention being led to it by a ghost? "Debris cleanup is suspicious, but that's the border region for you. Maybe there's really nobody here.. what's your source on the location?"
[02:41] <03Quaker> There’s a metal handle on it, like the grip on a sliding glass door, but it doesn’t budge. 
[02:42] <03Crion_> 4What kind of shape are the walls around it in? Might it be easier to just...go through those?
[02:42] <03Crion_> 4Or are we looking at some kind of panic room here?
[02:42] <03Crion_> 4...Was it here last time Cav was?
[02:43] <03Quaker> Cav can’t remember the door being shut like this last time. It was a bedroom, before. Nothing in it except a bed and nightstand. The wall it shares with the bathroom is crumbling, but if he pokes further in he’ll realize that the metal shell extends there, too. 
[02:46] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "This is new."
[02:46] <03Crion_> "At least, the door be locked is."
[02:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson gets down in the hole. How far does it go?
01[02:48] <03banana> 6KJ: "I knew I should have brought plastique.. didn't find out we were coming out here until on the way over, sorry."
[02:48] <03Quaker> The passageway heads towards under the hall where he walked in. He can see that it branches off in an X shape, each branch heading towards a room upstairs. At the intersection, a vertical passage yawns, unlit, below him. There’s a metal ladder heading down into the darkness. 
[02:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Down into the tunnels?
[02:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Does one of these branches go into the sealed room?
[02:50] <03tom> 14Tommy curses and goes in after Baron Hollywood. He pokes his head back out of the crawlspace: "Keep watch, okay?"
[02:50] <03Quaker> No. His sense of space tells him that wherever it leads down, it’s drilling down slightly away from where the entrance to the dugouts and tunnels are. It seems to be going straight down, behind where the staircase was. 
[02:50] <03Crion_> "Sure." 4Claws probably can't cut through this, can they? Is there any other mechanism...?
[02:50] <03Quaker> And yes, one of the passages goes towards the sealed room. 
[02:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That doesn't go to the tunnels. You wanna check the sealed room or the ladder?"
01[02:51] <03banana> 6KJ moves out of the way to let Tommy past, and stops filming. There's useful information and then there's dark crawlspaces in haunted houses. "So the question is, how thick is this stuff? We can't get the car up here, and brute force may or may not be an option.."
01[02:51] <03banana> 6KJ moves out of the way to let Tommy past, and stops filming. There's useful information and then there's dark crawlspaces in haunted houses. "So the question is, how thick is this stuff? We can't get the car up here, and brute force may or may not be an option.."
[02:54] <03Quaker> One of the cats appears by Cav’s side. Someone approaching the house, alone, on foot. Smells like blood. Something wrong with it, like it’s walking injured. 
[02:54] <03Crion_> 4Cav nods. "Someone's headed our way," 4he translates to the rest. "Hurt. Alone."
[02:55] <03Crion_> 4Shots is the cat with him, meaning Honey's still out there stalking...escorting?...the approaching figure.
01[02:55] <03banana> 6'The rest' turns out to consist of a slightly nervous KJ and a room with a big hole in the floor. She'll relay a shout-whisper after the other two- "We're going to have company."
[02:55] <03tom> "Shit, maybe that's Sponger."
[02:56] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "We can handle it. You two keep looking."
[02:56] <03Crion_> "Doubt he's just gonna tell us everything we want to know straight up."
[02:56] <03Crion_> 4Plus, they're the beautiful people here. That should inspire some trust.
[02:57] <03tom> 14Tommy ducks back into the crawl space with a grumble.
01[02:58] <03banana> 6KJ: "Let's go meet them looking like we have way more right to be here than anyone whose actual home it might be."
[02:58] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Sounds good to me. After you, Baron Anaheim."
[02:59] <03Quaker> It’s not Sponger. The person walking towards the porch - staggering, really - holding their side, dragging a broken leg in the mud, only has half of their face visible under their Circle mask, where it’s been broken off as if by a violent blow. Blood runs down their side, flowing in gouts, past where their hand is clamped down. 
[02:59] <03Crion_> 4Cav's smile falls off his face. "Well, shit."
01[02:59] <03banana> "Most kind, Laguna." 6KJ descends the stairs toward the staggering dude without pause.
01[03:00] <03banana> 6Can they see her? Can they hear this? "Hey. We'd like to know two things: what you're running from, and what sanctuary you hoped to find here."
[03:01] <03Quaker> The man doesn’t get halfway up the porch steps before he falls over, groaning, rolling on his back. The mask slips off and falls into the mud. If they get close, they can see his eyes aren’t focusing on anything, just moving rapidly around, sightlessly. 
[03:01] <03Quaker> If he heard her, he doesn’t show it. They can hear him continue to mutter something over and over. 
[03:02] <03Crion_> 4Cav tenses his hands.
[03:02] <03Crion_> 4What's he saying.
01[03:02] <03banana> 6If he thinks a dying soliloquy is gonna preclude answering the posse's questions, he'll be wrong shortly.
[03:04] <03Quaker> “Come, true light, Come, eternal life, Come, hidden mystery, Come, nameless treasure, Come, endless rejoicing, Come, sun that never rises, Come, Motionless One, ever active, come to us, and save us who lie in Hell, come Solitary One, to this solitary, for as you see I am all alone, Come, for you have alienated me from all things and made me be alone in this world, Come, true light, Come, eternal life, Come, hidden mystery…” 
[03:05] <03Crion_> 4To KJ: "You ever the get the feeling people only ever tell you half of everything you need to know, all the time?"
[03:05] <03Quaker> In the woods, past their sight, as the rain falls in sheets and the wind blows it into their faces, something lets out a scream. 
[03:06] <03Quaker> NEXT TIME: The Gospel of Transfiguration 
01[03:06] <03banana> 6KJ: "Not really." 6This is going to be an interesting interrogation.

[22:37] <03Quaker> -
[22:37] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWCYgHXy8C8
[22:40] <03Quaker> Outside, the rain falls harder than it has the past few hours. The road has turned into a miniature stream - they can barely see the shape of the Land Rover parked a few yards away from the front steps, and its tires are submerged a few inches in running water. The little rise in the land that the house sits on means that they’re dry, for now. Well, as dry as one can get in a pouring storm. 
[22:40] <03Crion> 4Bad night to be making housecalls in the valley.
[22:41] <03Quaker> Beneath them, in the mud a few steps from the front stairs of the grand, ruined house, the man with the ruined wood mask gives a shudder, and is still. His last words were faint, and hadn’t changed from his repeated prayer. Blood pools under him, visible even through the mud and water. 
01[22:42] <03banana> 6KJ crosses her arms, staring skeptically at the collapsing witch before her and Baron Laguna. Does the man think he can get away with babbling portentous crimes and then take the easy way out?
01[22:42] <03banana> 6What's wrong with him, and how much forcibly administered vitae would it take to fix it?
[22:44] <03Crion> 4Cav, meanwhile, has walked to the very edge of wherever will keep him out of the rain to scan what's left of the treeline. See if there's anymore of them out there. God knows it'll be hard to hear them in this rain.
[22:44] <03Quaker> He seems to be bleeding from a terrible, tearing wound from under his arm down to his pelvis on the side of his body. Whatever ruined him had enough force behind it that it didn’t cut cleanly, or at least crushed and clawed as much as it severed. Blood runs in a dark red stream into the ground. Who knows how much he needs, or if it would help? 
01[22:45] <03banana> 6So is he slipping into torpor at the moment?
01[22:46] <03banana> 6(If nothing is done)
[22:47] <03Quaker> All of this remains unknown to the man on his hands and knees in the small, hidden tunnel under the floorboards. Wilson seems to be…somewhere. He was just ahead of Tommy when they got to the X intersection, one path leading to each upstairs room, and one vertical passageway leading down, into darkness…
[22:47] <03tom> 14Deacon Saldana: "Jesus Christ."
[22:48] <03tom> 14He tries to turn around, wedges himself into a fetal position, has a small panic attack.
[22:48] <03Quaker> He’ll be either in torpor or completely dead in a few minutes, at the rate he’s losing vitae. His Beast, faint and sluggish, confirms what should have been an easy guess, regarding his nature. 
[22:49] <03tom> 14Tommy peers down the vertical passageway. Are there, like, hand-grips, or ladder rungs? Is it just a vertical shaft with smooth walls...?
[22:50] <03Quaker> As Cav looks into the rain, he can see something….part the rain, with its size. It’s a few dozen yards out, past the Land Rover, in the trees beyond the house’s clearing. It moves smoothly, back and forth, its great black bulk pacing to and fro, shaking the trunks of the trees it passes as it brushes them. It must be the source of the great piercing howl they heard. 
[22:51] <03Quaker> KJ’s senses are a bit finer in the moment. She can hear it, place it, tell it’s not coming closer for now. 
[22:51] <03Quaker> There’s a little metal ladder bolted into the hard clay soil of the shaft. 
[22:51] <03Crion> "Something out there."
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yep. Let's get this guy inside."
01[22:53] <03banana> 6She's going to shoulder the man, and press a wrist to his mouth to see if he's capable of taking advantage. It hurts. But this is an opportunity.
[22:54] <03tom> 14Tommy grips the metal poles on each side of the first rung and heaves himself into the shaft, letting his weight carry him sliding down the ladder.
[22:54] <03Crion> 4Cav will have already signaled for his cats to pull back. Looks like they won't be going back out the front, at least not for awhile.
[22:54] <03tom> 14He counts as he drops, hoping to get some measure of distance.
[22:54] <03Crion> 4Cav: "How dead is he?"
[22:57] <03Quaker> The man’s fangs reflexively sink into KJ’s wrist, and he drinks her stolen blood. She can feel the blood run through her arm into him…and pass out a few moments later. Enough stays in him so that he seems to come around, but the mindless stitching and repairing that should be taking place, isn’t. Something appears to be preventing the blood from clotting properly. 
[23:00] <03Quaker> Tommy lands on something half metal, and half soft. Then he realizes he’s standing on Wilson, at the bottom of a large hole some thirty feet down. The Nosferatu is slumped over at the bottom of the ladder, eyes closed. It’s pitch dark down here. Can Tommy see in the dark? 
[23:00] <03Crion> 4Shots and Honey are going to take up positions lurking on the second floor, well-sheltered and able to flee if things go bad, but also poised to drop down and...well, let's be honest. If that's a werewolf out there, they're not going to be able to do much.
[23:00] <03Crion> 4And if it's not a werewolf, then things are even worse.
[23:01] <03tom> 14In a moment, he can.
[23:02] <03tom> "Oof. Aw shit, Wilson? Wilson, man-" 14Tommy grabs the nosferatu by the lapels and shakes, to no effect.
[23:05] <03Crion> 4Cav considers drawing his Glock, but figures it would just make him look stupid. No pistol's going to best what's out there.
01[23:06] <03banana> 6KJ staggers slightly as she sets the acolyte down on the stairs. If the cats want to eat him they're welcome, she guesses. 
[23:06] <03Quaker> The chamber is roughly circular, hewn out by hand and instrument. The walls are lined with bookshelves - some bare, some splintered so badly they’re really more heaps of broken wood, some holding moldering and torn volumes. There’s a desk on the opposite side of the chamber, an overturned wooden chair in front of it. The desk is covered with papers and miscellany like pens, magnifying glasses, and an ancient-looking calculator. There’s 
[23:06] <03Quaker> lamps of some kind on brackets around the room, but they’re unlit. 
01[23:06] <03banana> "He's been poisoned or enspelled, maybe wolf-bitten.. not actually dead. Not recovering any time soon."
[23:08] <03Quaker> Which stairs? The front stairs are barely out of the elements…and the ones in the front grand room are behind the front doors, now closed. At least the lights are on downstairs, now. They can hear music coming from the house. 
[23:08] <03Crion> 4Cav: "If he's not verbal, he can't help us; if he can't help us, he's not a priority. If that's not a werewolf out there in it's final fuck-you form, then it's Jubal with a brand new Halloween costume."
[23:10] <03tom> 14Tommy curses. No Sponger here, either. And what's wrong with Wilson?
01[23:10] <03banana> "What do I need to know about Jubal?"
01[23:10] <03banana> 6If it's werewolves, either they lose interest or we're dead anyway.
[23:11] <03Quaker> He seems to be unconscious. No visible wounds or injuries. 
01[23:11] <03banana> 6KJ was referring to the inner stairs, where Honey and Shots are guarding.
[23:12] <03tom> 14Tommy rises from a crouch and puts his hands on his hips, sighing. He nudges the insensate Wilson with his shoe. "Fuck."
[23:13] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Hierophant, and as personally potent as you'd expect him to be given that rank. His Cruac is on point -- 'killed a friend of mine with an acorn' good. He seems particularly fond of transmutation -- changing the form of flesh with the power of the blood. I think that's a school of Cruac, at least."
01[23:14] <03banana> 6KJ: "Ehhh. Okay, so it sounds like our best shot would be to attack on sight? The rituals take time."
[23:14] <03Crion> "Attacked us in some high vengeant owl-demon form last Halloween. Good news is, we used this flashlight" 4Cav produces it. "to set him on fire. He does not like its beam at all. Bad news is now he knows about that, and if it's him, he'll have made preparations to counter it."
[23:15] <03Crion> "The rituals do take time, presuming they weren't already in the hopper before we got here."
[23:15] <03Crion> 4He peeks out the window. "Now if it's not Jubal, the game's a lot simpler. It's a werewolf. Claws, jaws, and rage. It'll tear us apart."
[23:15] <03Quaker> Oh. Then they’ll have one more thing to look at as they come in through the front doors. As they enter, the, uh….hmm. The formerly ruined front room seems to be entirely repaired. Decorated, even, as for a party. The wooden floors are no longer warped by water, the paint isn’t peeling, the ceiling is in one piece. The lighting is soft and golden. The inside of the house feels pleasantly warm compared to the chill outside. Coat racks in 
[23:15] <03Quaker> the foyer are full with mink and fine satin. They can hear laughter coming softly from beyond, in the main hall. 
[23:16] <03Quaker> The music they heard earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CERvQW0iSDQ
[23:16] <03Crion> 4Hee indicates the other dead cultist -- the one that was already there. "That man was beaten to death."
[23:16] <03Crion> "A vampire. Beaten to death. Blunt force trauma, through torpor and out the other side."
[23:16] <03Quaker> The dead cultist is still there, though. It’s a bit of an incongruity with the now pleasant room. 
01[23:16] <03banana> "Then maybe we should try and get into the panic room- what?"
[23:16] <03Crion> "Usually a werewolf uses claws, but that's the sort of strength and anger you're de--"
[23:16] <03Crion> 4...
[23:16] <03Crion> "...The fuck?"
01[23:17] <03banana> "This is what he saw!"
01[23:17] <03banana> 6KJ cups her hands and yells into the impossible mansion: "Wilson! Where's Baron Hollywood?"
[23:20] <03Crion> 4Cav snaps out of it after a second and begins looking around specifically at the decorations -- he's looking for any sign that this is, indeed, Thomas Franks's restored foyer, rather than some other room entirely.
[23:21] <03tom> 14Tommy drags Wilson away from the base of the ladder and lays him out on the dusty floor, cursing under his breath. He briefly considers going through the man's pockets, but instead turns over the wooden chair from the study and lights up a cigarette.
[23:21] <03tom> 14He checks his watch after a fashion, sniffs, and rubs out his cigarette on the floor and proceeds back up the ladder.
[23:22] <03Quaker> It matches the dimensions of the foyer they saw before…it’s just been changed. 
01[23:23] <03banana> 6It has to be.. memory, triggered by something. Cruac? But there's only one of them who could have brought it here, the image of a restored mansion. KJ heads up to the landing, looking for Tommy and Wilson.
[23:24] <03tom> "Good luck, dude," 14he shouts back down into the darkness at the unconscious nosferatu.
[23:24] <03Crion> 4Cav follows. Give him a landmark: a notable vase, a weird painting, a distinguished chair. Anything that stands out in the room. Doesn't matter what.
[23:25] <03Quaker> Whether any of the mess in the chamber has been left by Sponger, Tommy can’t tell. His rummaging doesn’t come up with anything particularly useful - the desk’s drawers are locked, and he doesn’t have the key. 
[23:25] <03tom> 14Tommy curses all the way back out the tunnel and emerges coughing covered in fine particles of dust and lint.
[23:26] <03Quaker> KJ and Cav come into the main hall, leading up to the 2nd floor landing. The house here is just as well-lit. Bunting hangs from railings and paper ribbons dangle from the ceiling. Punch bowls and silver serving trays stand on tables set on the side of the rooms. Around them, indistinct shadows the size of people laugh and murmur indistinctly, gathered in small groups as they would be at a party. 
[23:27] <03Crion> 4Punch bowl! That'll do.
[23:27] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Baron Anaheim." 4He points at the punch bowl. "There's a punch bowl sitting right there, well-polished and apparently half-full. Do you see it?"
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: "No, I think it. Our minds are being affected - this is someone else's idea overload onto our sense. I think it's the memory of a party Franks once threw."
01[23:29] <03banana> "Specifically, I think it's- Saldana! Where's Frost?"
[23:30] <03tom> "He's out cold in the tunnel. I have no idea what happened."
[23:30] <03Quaker> Cav noticed a portrait hung over the staircase leading to the 2nd floor. The wind and rain had ruined it, but now he can see it in its restored former form. http://i.imgur.com/ajKmbpY.jpg
[23:30] <03tom> "Also hello, what the fuck's going on here."
[23:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah, my point is that it's the same vision. It's not building itself out of our perceptions, letting our brains interpret it and decide what we see. That's some powerful mojo."
[23:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Where am I?
[23:31] <03Quaker> Wilson wakes up in the cold and the dark. He’s at the bottom of a hole, next to a metal ladder. 
[23:31] <03tom> 14He's been laid out on the floor, and his pockets have not been gone through
01[23:32] <03banana> 6KJ: "Nightmare works like that. Powerful nosferatu don't just suggest- they force their own impression."
[23:32] <03Quaker> As Tommy comes out of the passageway, he can see the same restoration has been applied to the upstairs. The bookshelves in the study have been stood upright, their shelves re-ordered…but any closer examination reveals the titles on the spines remain undistinct and hazy. The shadows are chatting here, too…but he can only hear snatches and fragments, words swimming into intelligbleness for a few moments before drifting away again. 
[23:34] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah, but they're also usually constrained to one aesthetic. Fancy dinner parties don't quite fit it."
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What? Is this- oh. Right. The opera. The ride. The ghost. Wilson gets stiffly to his feet and gets the flashlight out. It's crazy bright, and he squints against it.
[23:36] <03Quaker> He’ll see what Tommy saw - the bookshelves, the lamps, the desk. 
01[23:37] <03banana> "Who knows? What if your fear is socialisation?"
01[23:38] <03banana> 6KJ leans on whichever of the walls is real. "The illusion can't hurt us. Whatever caused it to enter our minds might."
[23:39] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, that would explain why neither of us are particularly frightened, here."
01[23:39] <03banana> "Haha! I hope it keeps the werewolves out, if they exist and aren't the cause of it."
[23:39] <03Quaker> As KJ and Tommy speak, Cav focuses on the shadows…and they seem to come into focus. If he looks at them hard enough, they stop being people-shaped…and become people. People he doesn’t know, at first, but…
[23:40] <03Crion> 4Cav holds up a hand to pause Baron Anaheim right there.
[23:42] <03Quaker> Wilson’s investigation proceeds much as Tommy’s did…except he tries the desk drawers. One is locked, but the other…
[23:43] <03Quaker> There’s a few scraps of paper in here. Mostly doodles, but also a thin case of leather with a single sheet and a fine fountain pen, black inlaid with real silver. Only one thing has been written on it: 
[23:43] <03Quaker> The presbyter went to his May devotions
[23:43] <03Quaker> And it took
[23:43] <03Quaker> A long time
[23:43] <03Quaker> To get dark
[23:43] <03Quaker> Before it did
[23:44] <03Quaker> The birds made
[23:44] <03Quaker> A din
[23:44] <03Quaker> In the trees
[23:44] <03Quaker> Its distant lessons
[23:44] <03Quaker> spell out
[23:44] <03Quaker> the lessons of a lighter world
[23:44] <03Quaker> -
[23:44] <03Quaker> Do we really die
[23:44] <03Quaker> Only once
[23:44] <03Quaker> -
[23:44] <03Quaker> From the road that leads
[23:44] <03Quaker> that led down to the Broadway
[23:44] <03Quaker> Tunnel I saw
[23:44] <03Quaker> the red disk of the sun
[23:44] <03Quaker> rising over the 
[23:44] <03Quaker> promised city. 
[23:45] <03Quaker> - Tamas Francia
[23:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson reads and rereads the poem, even though all it does is make him feel achingly lonely. A moment passes, standing behind the only light in the hole, before he folds up the poem, pockets it and the pen, and forces the locked drawer open.
01[23:48] <03banana> 6KJ is successfully paused, given the likelihood that whatever he's noticed is life-threatening.
[23:49] <03Crion> 4They're...they're right on the lips of his mind. Dammit! He needs to add pictures to his contact list!
01[23:49] <03banana> 6To Tommy: "Out cold, you say? Figures, sort of."
01[23:49] <03banana> "Any luck finding a way into the panic room?"
[23:49] <03Quaker> Cav looks about the room. He doesn’t recognize anyone. The faces seem aristocratic, well-bred, comfortable…but not familiar. 
[23:49] <03Quaker> Until he sees his sire walking up the stairs. 
[23:51] <03Crion> 4Very evenly, but strained. "Baron Anaheim I need you to look at the staircase, right now, and tell me if you see a man walking up it."
[23:51] <03tom> 14He shakes his head. "I don't know what the fuck's going on, but I doubt any of this has to do with Sponger."
[23:51] <03Crion> 4Oh. She's left.
[23:51] <03tom> "I'm starting to think we're getting played."
01[23:51] <03banana> 6..does KJ see a man walking up the staircase?
01[23:52] <03banana> "Deacon, we are getting fucking pwned right now. Best to keep calm about it."
01[23:52] <03banana> "I think it's worth investigating the location of the panic room in this memory- if we're lucky there might be, like, a secret switch clearly visible."
[23:53] <03Crion> *4Very evenly, but strained. "Baron Anaheim I need you to look at the staircase, right now, and tell me if you see a woman walking up it."
01[23:53] <03banana> *6..does KJ see a woman walking up the staircase?
[23:57] <03Quaker> She does. Beautiful, dark, composed. Dressed in red, walking towards and then past them, towards the metal panic room. Except…it’s a bedroom, now. 
[23:57] <03tom> 14Tommy checks his watch. What time is it?
[23:58] <03Quaker> A few minutes past midnight. 
[23:58] <03tom> 14He makes a note of it.
01[23:59] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yep. Shared delusion."
Session Time: Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 2017
01[00:00] <03banana> 6KJ: "Unfortunately it doesn't look like there's any insight here on a way in..
01[00:00] <03banana> "
[00:01] <03Crion> 4Cav: "..."
[00:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Come on, come on... there!
[00:01] <03tom> 14Tommy lingers a moment at the base of the stairs before following the others; he steps over to the front-facing windows and leans to take a peek through the blinds, just to check, just to be sure there's nothing out there in the rain.
[00:02] <03Quaker> The desk’s wooden construction gives way, no match for the Nosferatu’s strength. 
[00:03] <03Quaker> Upstairs, the party ends quite suddenly. The warmth floods out, the light fades, the music and the laughter stop. The shadows dissolve. All of a sudden, the three of them are standing in a leaky, molding, ruin once more. 
[00:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson, oblivious to any of this, searches the now exposed drawer's contents.
[00:05] <03Crion> 4Good. Good. She's only four feet away when she vanishes. Good.
[00:05] <03Quaker> Inside the desk, Wilson finds another leather case. Inside are dozens of small slips of paper, each cut too neatly to just be torn-off scraps. On the paper, neat rows of numbers, seemingly random, march down the pages.
[00:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Code? Maybe Valentine knows someone.
[00:06] <03Quaker> Such as: http://i.imgur.com/2iWApVL.jpg
01[00:06] <03banana> 6KJ: "Huh."
01[00:07] <03banana> 6KJ: "Here's my guess: Baron Hollywood just woke up."
[00:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He'll bring these up too. After leaping from the base of the latter up to the crawlspace junction, he'll come back into the corridor. Where's everybody else?
[00:08] <03Quaker> Standing in front of the metal panic room door, looking a bit dazed. 
[00:08] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Hmm?"
[00:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How's everybody's cryptography?"
[00:09] <03tom> 14Tommy comes up the stairs. "Oh, hey, you woke up."
[00:09] <03tom> "Look, some weird shit's going on."
01[00:10] <03banana> 6KJ says, "Ha." 6It's not clear whether she's responding to Wilson's words or just his presence.
[00:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "...anyway, I found these codes in the study under the crawl space. I think they're codes. Might be nonsense. I'm going to go back in and see if there's an easy entrance into the panic room from underneath. Excuse me." 10He'll hand the pads off to whoever's closest before turning around.
[00:15] <03Crion> 4Cav is staring off the balcony down at the now quiet hall.
[00:17] <03tom> 14Tommy takes the pad.
[00:17] <03Quaker> Wilson finds the X-intersection again, and if he heads down the passage that heads towards the direction of the metal room, he’ll see that there’s a hatch, unopened, just like the one he came in through. There’s light, warmth, and sound coming from the other side. 
[00:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is there cell phone reception down here?
01[00:19] <03banana> "Interesting." 6If he's not going to mention the illusion, neither's KJ yet.. "So what have we got, Saldana? Groups of numbers?"
[00:19] <03Quaker> There is not. It cut out half a mile before they got to the house. Satphones should still work, if he’s got one. 
01[00:19] <03banana> 6If Tommy will show the code(?), KJ takes a picture of the pad with her invisible phone.
[00:19] <03tom> 14He flips to the next page. "Looks like."
[00:19] <03Crion> 4After a moment, Cav shakes his head. He can think about this later.
[00:19] <03tom> 14He flips the pad around and shows it to KJ
01[00:20] <03banana> "It definitely looks like some sort of old cipher, blocks each representing a letter. But it could be anything, and I'm barely even an amateur."
01[00:20] <03banana> "I know who to run it by once we're back.." 6She holds out a hand.
[00:21] <03tom> 14He hands over the pad. "Well, I guess I better get back down there in case Wilson conks off again.."
[00:22] <03tom> 14He grumbles as he ducks back down into the tunnel after the other Nosferatu.
[00:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then he'll come back out into the corridor. "Either the panic room's haunted too or somebody's in there.
[00:22] <03tom> "Great, hopefully that's our guy and we can get the fuck outta here"
[00:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He bumps into Tommy awkwardly on the way out and they shuffle out into the hall together.
[00:22] <03Crion> 4It's a sign of the night they're having that this is a statement of fact, not a joke.
[00:22] <03Crion> 4Cav: "We're not leaving. At least not yet."
[00:22] <03tom> 14Tommy pats him on the back equally awkwardly as he shuffles past.
[00:22] <03Crion> "There's something outside."
[00:23] <03tom> "All the better reason to get the fuck going."
[00:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There's a hatch  access to the panic room from the crawl space. You want to try it?"
[00:23] <03tom> "I'm on it."
[00:23] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, it's stalking around our cars. We could try to walk back, but..."
[00:23] <03tom> 14Tommy crawls to the hatch and cracks his knuckles. 
[00:24] <03tom> 14He bangs his fist against the metal surface. "Sponger you son of a bitch, you better be in there!"
01[00:24] <03banana> 6KJ: "We're stuck here, so let's at least try."
[00:24] <03tom> 14Is it unlocked?
[00:24] <03Quaker> It is. 
[00:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "No point in giving up when giving up doesn't save you any trouble."
[00:25] <03Quaker> The music doesn’t change. He can hushed conversation. 
[00:25] <03tom> 14Then instead of activating vigor and trying to rip the damn thing off, he prises the hatch open and tumbles inside.
01[00:25] <03banana> "Right, save it for tactical surrenders." 6KJ's going to find a shadowy spot just by the tunnel and the main door, fade into nothing and provide cover or a surprise..
[00:28] <03Quaker> The inside of the bedroom looks like it’s just been bought and furnished. The bed is made with fine linens and silk pillows. The small bookshelf and night-stand are decorated with green glass lamps, the walls with paintings of distant landscapes and nature scenes. 
[00:29] <03Quaker> Inside, a man is standing next to the bed. His long, handsome face has been permanently scarred with some disfigurement, although a full beard hides some of it. Next to him, a woman with dark brown hair in a red dress is listening to him speak. On the bed, another woman with long blonde hair put up in rings and coils sits on the bed and listens as well. 
[00:30] <03tom> "Who the fuck are you people!?"
[00:30] <03tom> "Is every fuckin' person in L.A. buying timeshares out here??"
[00:33] <03Quaker> The man looks at Tommy. He knows him- but…
[00:33] <03Quaker> “Hello, Thomas.” 
[00:33] <03Quaker> Tommy can hear a quiet moan from somewhere in the room. 
[00:35] <03tom> "Do I know you, asshole?" 14Tommy looks for the source of the moan.
[00:37] <03Quaker> Sponger is on his side, in a corner. Tommy gets the feeling that if he moves over to him, whatever else in the room will stop. 
[00:38] <03tom> "Dude, Sp- Souza, are you okay?"
[00:38] <03Quaker> “I did, once.” The man returns to his conversation. It’s hard to tell, with words falling in and out of audible range seemingly at random. 
[00:39] <03tom> 14Tommy pushes past people and grabs Sponger by the arm.
[00:40] <03Quaker> Sponger looks up. His red and blue checkered bandana has been torn. His eyes struggle to focus, and Tommy can see the blood around his form. The room is empty except for him and the other Nosferatu. There’s not much in here except for some wrecked furniture. The metal lock of the door has a bloody handprint on it, with some blood leading down to Sponger. He must have closed it and immediately fallen over. 
[00:41] <03tom> "Dude, what the fuck."
[00:41] <03Quaker> “Deacon…?” He coughs. “What…how…did you find me….” 
[00:41] <03tom> "It wasn't easy, asshole."
[00:41] <03tom> "Come on man, let's get you outta here"
[00:42] <03Quaker> “Wait…don’t move me….” He coughs again, grimacing. “Blood…won’t stop up…something wrong with me…Circle knife….” 
[00:43] <03tom> "Shit."
01[00:43] <03banana> 6Just outside the tunnel, someone speaks out of thin air besides Cavanaugh (it's KJ obviously). "I heard them say Souza.. he's in there alright. Wish they'd open the door from the inside."
[00:43] <03tom> "Hey!" 14He shouts up the hatch. "I found Sponger, he's hurt pretty bad though..."
[00:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Torpid?"
[00:44] <03tom> "Nah, someone got'em with a circle knife or somethin', won't stop bleeding."
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> ",,,starved?"
[00:44] <03Crion> 4Cav, meanwhile, is trying to remember the layout of the tunnels they used before -- and specifically any other exits. They need other ways out of this house. The cats can help here.
[00:46] <03tom> 14Tommy doesn't answer Wilson. He squeezes his eyes shut, tries to think. "Okay, okay, look Sponger, Soria sent us. We're here to get you back to Mission Viejo."
[00:46] <03tom> "We think we can get you outta beating the shit outta Cosmo Morgan, but you gotta trust me."
[00:50] <03Quaker> “Can…you stop the bleeding…don’t think I’ll last long if you don’t…” 
[00:50] <03tom> "Yeah, I was getting to that"
[00:53] <03tom> 14Tommy leans over the wound and takes a look, muttering as he does so. "So you got stabbed by some magic knife, kinda-deal?"
[00:56] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You know..." 4His voice sounds like it's coming from very far away. "I didn't think of it until...something jarred my mind, just now, but I've seen this before."
[00:56] <03Crion> "The unnatural hemophilia."
[00:57] <03Crion> "We had a priest bless the blood."
[00:57] <03Crion> "The vitae."
[00:57] <03Crion> "Whatever."
[00:57] <03Crion> "Neutralize it."
[00:57] <03Crion> "Shit, what was that guy's name..."
[00:58] <03Crion> "Fuck if I know."
[00:58] <03Quaker> Sponger manages to shift himself into a sitting position with some effort. A fresh gout of blood comes out for his efforts. “We surprised each other…he got me with it.” He presses a hand to his wound. “I hit him until…he stopped moving…think it nicked him, too…when he died….no torpor…just dead.” He laughs. It’s unpleasantly wet. “I think that would happen to me, too…” 
01[01:00] <03banana> 6Assuming someone's actually opened the door, KJ's on the scene now too. (She doesn't want to get her coat dirty in those tunnels, come on). "Sanctum? Whoever it is they aren't here, so we'll have to move."
[01:00] <03tom> "Ok, well, look, worst-case scenario is you keep bleeding as we move you, and then we'll top you off when we get to the car."
[01:00] <03tom> "I've got enough that I can spare some."
03[01:00] * Joins: dammitwho (joanofarcta@sorcery-5luvlc.dynamic.onlinenw.com)
01[01:00] <03banana> "Yeah, if you've got the same thing as the cultist outside we can stabilise you at least."
[01:00] <03tom> "No way to get around the fact it's gonna hurt like a sum-bitch though."
[01:00] <03tom> "You're a nosferatu, though. We're tough as shit, right?"
[01:01] <03tom> "You're tough."
01[01:01] <03banana> 6It's probably not clear to Souza who that was talking just now, but he's unlikely to care.
[01:01] <03Quaker> “Wait….” He waves a hand. “Take me…where…the thing with Morgan…they were going to kill me anyway for it…”
[01:02] <03Quaker> “I was going to…go east…but…accident, I guess…bad luck…you might as well leave me here…” 
[01:02] <03tom> "Shut the fuck up, Sponger, we didn't come all this way to rescue you so you could punk out and sacrifice yourself."
[01:02] <03tom> "Now you're coming with us to Mission Viejo even if I have to drag your dumb ass there overland."
[01:03] <03tom> 14He yells back out the hatch: "Can someone get some, like, towels or blankets or something? S'for the car."
01[01:06] <03banana> 6There are some illusionary ones, but..
01[01:07] <03banana> "No time for niceties. We've got to make a dash for the car in case the thing's still out there."
01[01:07] <03banana> "..actually, I'll go take a look. Bring Souza down to the entrance, will you?"
[01:09] <03tom> "Alright Sponger, this is going to hurt, like, a lot."
[01:09] <03tom> "If you feel yourself getting faint you just bite down on my arm and drink what you need, okay?"
[01:09] <03tom> "Once you're in the car you won't need to move much."
[01:09] <03Quaker> Souza nods. He looks like he might pass out at any moment. 
[01:10] <03tom> "Five, four, three-" 14And he just hoists Sponger up onto his back.
[01:10] <03Crion> "Fuck. Fuck fuck. WAIT!" 4Cav shouts triumphantly. "I WROTE IT DOWN!"
[01:10] <03Quaker> The Nosferatu is big, but he’s being carried by another Nosferatu, so it evens out. 
[01:10] <03Crion> "It's in the cloud!"
[01:10] <03Crion> 4He is holding his phone up triumphally.
[01:10] <03Crion> 4After a beat: "The, uh, ritual."
[01:13] <03tom> 14Tommy hauls Sponger out onto the floor outside the tunnel and sets him down, panting. Which is strange, because he doesn't respire anymore.
[01:13] <03tom> 14He wipes his mouth. "What ritual?"
[01:13] <03Crion> 4And anyone who looks at the notes screen on his iPhone 7 can see that he did, indeed, write something down. It's the details of a Sanctum ritual, having to be performed by an appropriately empowered and frocked (and skilled) member of the clergy, called "Wine to Water." What it does, given some compromised portion of Vitae, is cleanse and neutralize it -- spiritually and, more 
[01:13] <03Crion> 4importantly, magically.
[01:13] <03Quaker> Outside, in the pouring rain, KJ finds the Land Rover as they left it. 
[01:13] <03tom> 14Aw, shit. They're gonna expect me to do that.
[01:14] <03Quaker> The shape in the trees is still moving back and forth. 
01[01:14] <03banana> 6She paces halfway to the vehicle, keeping an eye out for displacement of the rain- fuck.
01[01:14] <03banana> 6Just how far away is it from the car?
[01:15] <03tom> 14Tommy squints at the screen. "What's it need?"
01[01:15] <03banana> 6If it's more than a few metres.. she's going to make a dash for the driver's seat with the hope of bringing the vehicle right up to the ruined portico.
[01:16] <03Crion> 4It does so by using blood the afflicted Kindred is drinking as a delivery method -- so that instead of the new blood becoming poisoned when it becomes Vitae, the Vitae instead becomes clean.
[01:16] <03Crion> 4The ritual involves oil to the forehead, a bird's skull, a grey cloth, a metal bowl to hold blood, and the recital of the 39th Psalm, followed by giving blood to the victim from a donor.
[01:16] <03Quaker> About an eighth of a mile. She can barely see it…and then, for a moment, the clouds shift, and the thing’s form is revealed for a split-second. 
[01:16] <03Quaker> It’s not a werewolf. 
[01:16] <03Crion> "And I know it works on this specifically because...the person being treated then had it too."
[01:16] <03tom> "Okay, cool, great. Everyone pick one thing, we're doing a treasure hunt."
[01:17] <03tom> "Souza, you still alive?" 14He shakes the man's arm.
[01:18] <03tom> "Oil, okay, do you think we can get away with engine oil? That'll be in the car."
[01:18] <03tom> "I'm sure there's a metal bowl somewhere in this stupid mcmansion."
[01:18] <03tom> "And I bet we can find a bird somewhere."
[01:20] <03Quaker> Sponger groans. “Kitchen…” 
[01:20] <03tom> "Right, on it." 14Tommy rises from Souza's side and plods over.
[01:21] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll take care of the bird." 4More precisely, Honey and Shots will.
[01:21] <03Crion> 4Very carefully.
01[01:22] <03banana> 6.....
01[01:22] <03banana> 6KJ clicks her phone over to video record.
01[01:23] <03banana> 6She steps through the rain to the car, gets inside, winds all the windows up, starts the ignition.. and keeps filming the thing, hoping for another glimpse. She'll bring the SUV over to Franks' place as soon as there's someone at the doors, or in a minute anyway.. but just one more glimpse..
[01:23] <03Quaker> The kitchen is as the former deputies once found it: in a state of total disrepair, littered with trash, refuse, and scattered kitchen-y things. If he goes through the cupboards and pantries, he’ll find a (moldy, rusted) metal bowl, and a (crusted over, gross) nearly empty bottle of canola oil. 
01[01:24] <03banana> 6This thing should not exist, but if it's going to be out there she doesn't want to be the only one who has to think about it.
[01:24] <03tom> 14Tommy returns covered in yet more dust, but with the required reagents.
[01:25] <03Quaker> A few minutes later, the girls return with a decomposing swallow, a bit miffed that they have to carry it. 
[01:25] <03tom> 14The Deacon kneels next to Souza and dabs a bit of the rancid canola oil onto his forehead.
01[01:25] <03banana> 6Around then, the Land Rover's idling by the entrance. Nobody's coming out with a body, though..? What's up.
[01:25] <03tom> "Okay, what the hell do we do with the skull?"
[01:26] <03tom> 14He grabs the deteriorating bird and twists the head off.
[01:28] <03Crion> 4That's a very good question. Cav's notes are meticulous on ingredients, but a bit fuzzier on process.
[01:28] <03Crion> 4Understandably so, given that Cav is not a member of the church.
[01:29] <03Quaker> The thing doesn’t seem to hear the car as it makes the very short trip from near the front of the house to the actual front of the house. 
01[01:31] <03banana> 6That's good, but.. has the plan changed? The engine stops, a door closes. A couple of minutes later there's a voice inside the panic room. "The heck is going on, guys?"
[01:32] <03tom> 14Grumbling, Tommy sets the skull off next to Sponger and kinda-sorta gently nudges it against the nosferatu's face.
[01:32] <03tom> 14He takes out a pocket knife and jabs it into his palm. "Fffffuuuuck!" 14he screams.
[01:33] <03tom> 14He fumbles his pocket bible to the right page and holds his wounded hand over the bowl. "O LORD, you have searched me and known me-"
[01:35] <03Quaker> Sponger mumbles a prayer. 
[01:35] <03tom> 14Halfway through the ritual, Tommy glances over at the phone, narrows his eyes, and gingerly picks up the bird skull to toss it into the bowl.
[01:36] <03tom> "-Try me, and know my anxieties, and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way overlasting."
[01:38] <03Crion> 4Cav blinks as he rereads something on his phone, and then casually knocks the skull into the bowl
01[01:40] <03banana> 6Light in the doorway twists and turns into KJ Valentine. "Seriously what the f- what the heck is this." 6Does Sanctum magic go wrong if you, like, blaspheme? 
[01:40] <03tom> 14Tommy squeezes his fist, and a spattering of blood buries the skull. He picks up the bowl and, unsure what to do with it, tips it onto Sponger's mouth.
[01:42] <03Quaker> As the blood falls onto him, it turns grey, and into ash, spilling all over the Nosferatu’s form. Now covered in soot, Sponger gasps. The blood coming out of him slows, then stops. 
[01:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "This is good notetaking, paying off."
[01:46] <03tom> 14Tommy continues cursing and shaking his hand.
[01:46] <03tom> "Let's get the fuck outta here."
01[01:46] <03banana> "We have a lot of unanswered questions."
[01:48] <03tom> "Who fucking cares!?"
01[01:50] <03banana> 6KJ: "I do. They'll wait, though. Car's over here."
[01:50] <03tom> 14Tommy puts his arm around Sponger and helps the man up.
[01:51] <03Quaker> Covered in blood and soot, the lost Nosferatu is too weak to do anything except lean on Tommy. 
[01:52] <03Quaker> The rain is coming down just as hard as they get outside and help Sponger in. Is KJ ready to turn on the ignition and go…? 
[01:54] <03Crion> 4Cav's certainly ready to see the end of this place.
01[01:54] <03banana> 6Yeah, but she's propping her phone on the dashboard for one last try at a good recording. The idea is that if the horrifying crow-beast she saw picks up the car and rips it in two, some CSI investigator will at least get nightmares.
[01:57] <03Quaker> The car starts with a deep thrum, the headlights cutting through the mist and rain. Its wheels slowly grip the mud of the road, and pull the car forward, inch by inch. As they start to move, something roars behind them - 
[01:58] <03Quaker> The Land Rover bolts forward, heading straight to the gate and off of the property-
01[01:58] <03banana> "Hold on, please. We'll be going very fast."
[01:59] <03Quaker> And a shadow appears behind the car, another roar shaking the walls of the vehicle. There’s another, sudden shudder that makes everyone’s seatbelts hold tight, a horrible tearing noise, the car moves sideways- and the back hatch is ripped off in one sudden and great blow, whatever was in the trunk spilling out into the night- 
[02:00] <03tom> 14Tommy reaches for his shotgun.
[02:00] <03Quaker> But KJ keeps the thing going, peeling out onto the main road, the wind and rain coming in but nothing else, as the five of them bump and jostle on the muddy track heading back to civilization, away from the spectres of memory. 
[02:03] <03Quaker> NEXT TIME: Decoding 
[02:03] <03tom> 14Tommy has his shotgun braced against the top of the seatback, pointing into the darkness beyond the jagged metal mouth where the hatch used to be. "Ffuuuck."
01[02:09] <03banana> 6KJ doesn't exactly relax, though she wasn't exactly paniced in the first place. It's been a hell of a night but also a hell of a year. "Where are we headed - Mission Viejo or Laguna Beach?"

[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> Ir's been tracing a counterclockwise spiral through the center of the Hedgehog mountains. It hasn't been an uneventful trip, but neither has it been a hugely taxing one; she spread the news to the fourth holler in the area and helped them ready themselves to move by rustling up some game and dislodging a boulder so that it could serve as a natural bridge; she slew some kind of giant 
[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> scorpion that seemed to be a straggler from a prior raid; she stumbled across a weird old hermit rumored to be living on his own in the area and gave him the skinny on what's supposed to be coming up.
[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Pretend that was blue
[08:36] <03Crion> 4She pats Errant's neck. Harder on the horse than on her, to be honest.
[08:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12Now she and Errant are making their way up a winding slope that's looking increasingly artificial, a gravel path that winds between menhirs and around old, bare trees. It really takes it out of the pair - Ir can handle it, but Errant's breathing hard and unsteady.
[08:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "14hff- hff- hff-"
[08:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir finds Eikichi, Tatsuya, and Blossom in some kind of heated discussion with a pair of men. One's the young man in the conical hat whom she saw defending the downtrodden in a bar/teahouse off near the coast; the other's the spitting image of a wise old sage, a man with flowing white robes and flowing white hair and long, pointed ears and bright golden irises.
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12The old master's seated; the young student is standing, and has his hands raised in a martial stance. The latter looks incensed, while the former deeply concerned.
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Old man, whose name is Xalvierre, apparently: "You're going to what?"
[08:38] <03Crion> 4Good to see our knack at making friends is the same wherever we are.
[08:40] <03trenchfoot> 6We're really good at this.
[08:42] <03dammitwho> 7Well, Eikichi? What are we going to do?
[08:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's slightly flushed. "We've put a plan together to drive off the satrapy and free up more of the range to be safe for habitation. It's just, the fulcrum of the plan is, a portion of the mountain range is going to cease to exist for a couple of minutes."
[08:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ten at most."
[08:42] <03dammitwho> 7Oh, it's temporary. Blossom relaxes slightly.
[08:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Are you familiar with the lost Wyld-Shaping Technique?"
[08:44] <03Crion> "Hup." 4Ir hops down off Errant. To Tatsuya. "Hey there. Been awhile." 4Ir headed out before Ying changed back.
[08:45] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Hey. Mostly just tromping up the hills--" 6To Eikichi: "Please elaborate, for the listening audience."
[08:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre frowns. "I am... aware, yes. A practice not seen for some time."
[08:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "But you understand, surely, it is inapplicable here. A defter touch is needed."
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Ir just shakes her head.
[08:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Tatsuya: "Willing Creation out of raw unshaped Wyld. Pushing back the borders of reality. The Linchpins' accumulated centuries of energy can render a place down to a blank slate that can be reshaped."
[08:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Xalvierre: "Defter how?"
[08:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre gestures expansively. "Intrigues and secrets drive the courts of day and night both farther apart and closer together. The forces of the distant Realm encroach and immiserate. These things must be understood, experienced, contemplated... it's not within our remit to simply shape and reshape until the world suits us."
[08:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A thousand pardons, elder, but I disagree."
[08:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "And what of those ground between the wheels of your vision? What of the air and water, birds and beasts, day and night?"

[08:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's face is cheerfully blank. "Mmm?"
[09:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "I have not always kept the company I do now, as you must have intuited. Nor dwelled where you now stand."
[09:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Of course. But you are where you are, and not where you were. That says something, too."
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "To treat the world as a canvas, or a pile of colored sand - to casually assume a continuity between what you destroy and what you conjure. Is this not the very thing you fight against?"
[09:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't... think so?" 10He looks at Blossom. Is it?
[09:04] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya just shrugs. Honestly, it seems like a pretty good plan to him. Simple and clean.
[09:05] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We've already reshaped a city, Crystal. What makes this different?" 7The question is sincere. She's always wanted to debate with a wizened holy man.
[09:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "This I'll grant you: the sons of man have ever broadened the world's scope and built its wonders. But to dissolve and destroy what's there already, to bring the same annihilation preached by the church above...? It doesn't suit you, and shouldn't sit well."
[09:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Hmm... what do you make of this, then?" 10He shows Xalvierre the Linchpin.
[09:14] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom tilts her head: "You're suggesting that reducing an area of Creation to chaos, even in the service of beating back chaos, is abandoning a moral redoubt? I suppose..."
[09:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The line is not clearly drawn between creation and destruction... though this is definitely, definitely destruction..."
[09:17] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Destruction and creation in equal measure. Does it still cross the line, for you?"
[09:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre strokes his beard - it's a long beard, so it's a long motion to begin and complete - as he contemplates the implement that Eikichi proffers. "...what you hold is of great significance... and great danger. Some seals should remain unbroken."
[09:19] <03dammitwho> 7Eeeeee! He's stroking his beard sagely!
[09:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12The old man, or at least the old man-shaped creature, nods somberly to Blossom. "To fell a tree and raise a cabin... to till the soil and bring forth a harvest... all part of the workings of the world. But one cannot shape the Wyld here without first bringing the Wyld forth - and if I slew you, and dreamed up a replacement, it would come as cold comfort to your comrades."
[09:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Depends on the comrade.
[09:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We all know Tatsuya's always hated me.
[09:23] <03trenchfoot> 6That is unbelievably false.
[09:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12At this point, the young dragon-blooded Crane warrior is feeling a bit sheepish about standing there in a combat stance, so he's lowered his arms and stepped back and to the side of the creature he seems to take for a master. His name is Gsar, but Ir hasn't heard anyone say so yet.
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi only seems to notice him again when he sits down. To Xalvierre: "That may be. But Creation exists for the people who occupy it. Doesn't a debt of human suffering countervail against a gentler hand owed the earth and sea by its shepherds?"
[09:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "None should stand by when injustice is done - but evil must not be met with evil."
[09:28] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Could you shape the shallow Wyld in the freehold?"
[09:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, a middlemarch is too rigid. Raksha wouldn't actually like it out in the the shapeable Wyld - they're here not to be out there."
[09:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "I could, of course. But the results would be shallow, too."
[09:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Wyld-Nudging Technique."
[09:31] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "So, if we're abandoning the previous plan, what do we do?"
[09:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm not abandoning the previous plan."
[09:31] <03dammitwho> "What?"
[09:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre frowns, and looks to Eikichi's companions. "Is the plan his, or yours?" 12That's the plural 'yours'.
[09:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The elder's point is well-taken, but we have a duty to the people suffering under Cathak boots and fae bewitchment. The cost of my plan is high, yes, but I'm willing to pay it."
[09:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Incidentally, people use riverspeak around here, and that includes the old master.
[09:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi learned that from Tatsuya ages ago.
[09:36] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Eikichi proposed it. It seemed like a good one, so I agreed." 6He shifts slightly from his position. "If there's a better one, I'd like to hear it."
[09:37] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I'm sympathetic to wanting to fight the Church of Balor on all fronts, but Eikichi's plan is the only one I've heard that doesn't involve a protracted war on two fronts. So- if not a sphere of annihilation, then what?"
[09:37] <03Crion> 4Ir nods. She's allowed Errant to sit down and is currently standing around with her arms crossed.
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "It would be difficult indeed to resolve the struggle between night and day and to chastise the servants of the Realm. But would you rather do something quickly... or correctly? Do what's easy, or do what's right?"
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm not convinced those are different."
[09:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Surely you'd grant that sometimes it's necessary to be proactive?"
[09:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We've done quick, easy, and right before. Though I take your meaning."
[09:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "Of course. Training and self perfection demand seclusion - but that very training is what enables one to forge out, to challenge, to stake a claim and deny or revoke evil's advance."
[09:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "Executed deftly and justly, such action can serve not simply to destroy a wrongdoer but to cause in them a change of heart."
[09:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi flinches.
[09:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Maybe so."
[09:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "What if I told you... that night and day struggle for a reason? That even they cry out for heroes, seek an end to their own cycle of strife and terror?"
[09:48] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What if you did?"
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "That their loss would mean not only the loss of this world's original skies and mountains, a deadly danger visited upon the mortals living in and around them... but that even they could have been your brethren, as they are mine?"
[09:49] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I probably still wouldn't give a shit."
[09:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Kinda with Ir on this one."
[09:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you describe the Raksha as they are or the Raksha as you wish them to be?"
[09:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You'd indict my plan because it resembles the rhetoric of your kin. We didn't found the Church of Balor."
[09:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How many generations would you see my bretheren offer up until you can philosophize them into peace?"
[09:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "We're all here... rather than out there... because we love this world. In one way or another. All can learn. All can adapt."
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Maybe all can learn. I'd like to believe that. I've made... mistakes... founded on that hope."
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But I've seen firsthand the harm that the passivity of that hope inspires."
[09:59] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom rubs her chin thoughtfully. "Ir."
[09:59] <03dammitwho> "Do you think you could beat a fae king in a fiddle contest?"
[09:59] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Mmm."
[09:59] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Depends on the fiddle."
[09:59] <03Crion> "But yeah."
[10:00] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Raksha change their entire personalities based on their story, right?"
[10:00] <03dammitwho> "If you can beat them in a wager, we could rewrite their story..."
[10:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What kind of alternate narrative are you thinking of?"

[10:20] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "It does leave the idea floating around in my head, though.

[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi sighs. Xalvierre's points are well-reasoned, but they're the reasoning of someone who will forever stand outside the world, too admiring of its beauty to risk damaging it. The whips on the road. The bodies in the streets. Eikichi can't just watch.

[12:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre: "Can yours? Some can. Some of us are sensitive to the threats or challenges they present; others simply know what to look for. But in the latter case, I'm given to understand that some of the Dragon-Blooded can pass for mortal."
[12:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gsar certainly can; he didn't seem that weak when you saw him fight, but he's not notably blue-skinned or flecked with bits of coral or whatever.
[12:13] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm. Well, we can still work with that."
[12:13] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What are you thinking?"
[12:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What are-"
[12:14] <03dammitwho> 7She smiles siakaishly at the other Solars. "Not a lot of monks out here. We're going to convert the raksha to the Immaculate Philosophy, more or less."
[12:15] <03dammitwho> "And then we're going to lead them in battle against Gyozin."
[12:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "But isn't the Immaculate Philosophy not true?"
[12:15] <03Crion_> 4Ir's...interested.
[12:15] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Not the Realm orthodoxy, obviously! Then they'd attack us for being Anathema."
[12:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So we're just talking about direct ideological war with the Church of Balor, then."
[12:17] <03dammitwho> "Right! The calendars, the system of worship, the rites and regulations. The rules. One of the two things raksha need to live."
[12:17] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "This sounds less clean and immediately satisfying."
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Doesn't that leave us with the problem of the raksha subsisting on human souls?"
[12:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "It doesn't have to be souls! What do monks do that whips up a lot of ambient emotion? They lead the peasantry in worship."
[12:18] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'm glad you answered your own question, because I had a different one all lined up."
[12:19] <03dammitwho> "The newly freed plebs offer praises to Heaven, the fae take sips off the ocean of gratitude, and the Cathak slavers rot in the ground."
[12:19] <03dammitwho> "Everyone wins!"
[12:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't think you could sustain two entire raksha nations on that. Xalvierre achieved his equilibrium through extensive training."
[12:19] <03dammitwho> 7Could you sustain two entire raksha nations off that?
[12:22] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'm not opposed. I just - don't see the necessity."
[12:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Could you...? Large-scale sustainable faerie grazing... has possibly never been contemplated.

[12:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi thinks about it, and the more he does, the more intense the expression of distaste on his face.
[12:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Here's what we're contemplating:"
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> "First, we extract by comprehensive and duplicity-proof oaths the freeholds' compliance with our scheme."
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Second, they undertake a sweeping and categorical education program to teach themselves the techniques they need to feed sustainably."
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Third, we need to undertake an infrastructural project that gives them safe and sustainable access to the Wyld so that they can subsist, en masse, on less human suffering."
[12:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Fourth, we need to be okay with letting them just nibble on human souls."

[22:34] <03Quaker> Half an hour passes from the jarring blow of the thing in the woods’ clawed hand, and the Land Rover and its passengers find themselves in a familiar domain. The oak canopy here seems sparser, less constrictive. The rain has lessened to a light drizzle. Sponger hasn’t died in the meantime, though he still looks and sounds like someone who recently had a near-death experience. As the vehicle limps into the yard of the Modjeska House (their 
[22:34] <03Quaker> own cars parked neatly in the driveway), there’s no lights on to greet them. It seems Santiago trusts them to get back in their own cars without bothering him. 
[22:35] <03Crion> 4Cav stumbles out of the passenger's seat, waving back at the Land Rover. "Just leave it parked in the driveway and put the keys in the mailbox."
[22:36] <03Quaker> What now? 
[22:36] <03Crion> 4He pulls out his phone and calls the office.
[22:36] <03Crion> 4Does Brian or Bryan pick up?
01[22:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hey!" 6She's following Laguna, actually. Got a couple of things left to sya. This deacon guy - Saldana, with his weird skull magic - he probably knows what do with Sozua, and Hollywood can certainly rep the Invictus if there's any jurisdictional issues arising in the next five minutes.
01[22:38] <03banana> 6Obviously he's free to make a phone call first though.
[22:38] <03tom> 14Tommy slides out the passenger door and is inspecting the jagged edge of the hatchback's former perimeter. "Holy shit."
[22:39] <03Crion> 4To KJ, while the phone rings: "What?"
01[22:40] <03banana> "Dude, NONE of that was in the abstract."
[22:40] <03Crion> 4Cav: "No shit."
[22:40] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Welcome to Los Angeles."
[22:41] <03Crion> "That's the second damn time I've been ordered out to that hole, and the second time something's come out of the woods to try and kill my dead ass."
[22:41] <03Crion> "We need a travel ban on Santiago Valley, is what we need."
[22:42] <03tom> "Yeah man, Jesus."
01[22:43] <03banana> 6KJ's not soaked but she is bedraggled and visibly hassled. A buzz so harshed it becomes its own buzz of another sort. "Or warnings, anyway. You don't owe me, because it was Wilson who asked. He owes me. But if you've got something like this going again- next time, give out advanced warning so people can prepare."
[22:43] <03tom> 14He rubs the back of his neck. "I mean..."
[22:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll do my best. But you walk off the edge of the map, well. 'There be monsters.'"
[22:44] <03Crion> 4To Tommy: "You got a place to stash Sponger, or do you need one?"
[22:44] <03tom> "I was thinking of rolling back to Mission Viejo and having Soria handle it, that's usually his deal."
[22:45] <03tom> "We need to get Sponger's, like, testimony, right? To clear him of this whole... you know?"
[22:45] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll come with you, if you're amenable. I want to hear this too, and I've got some words for your bosses about how all this went down."
01[22:45] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah, I don't know. Better to draw the map first."
01[22:46] <03banana> "I'm going to do the research here post-hoc. You got numbers for updates? Slack, hipchat?" 6This is to both the guys- she's not butting in further about Sponger himself and having it counted as volunteering.
[22:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Is there a Slack app for iPhone?"
01[22:50] <03banana> 6KJ: "Of course. That's still where the people are who actually buy apps. If you haven't got it yet, follow 6@kindawellknown on twitter or instagram and I'll DM you back."
[22:51] <03tom> 14Tommy scratches his chin. "I uh... sure?"
[22:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Shame about Aguilar's car."
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ Valentine considers Tommy, his helpful acquiescence the bloodstains on his... garb. "Like, do you have a landline or something at least?"
[22:52] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Okay." 4Cav doesn't have a Twitter, but he's on Insta. His handle's @cav_clinton100014.
[22:53] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll buy him a new one."
[22:53] <03tom> "Oh I have a phone, it's just, I'm not very good at doing anything that requires, y'know... like.. signing up and shit?"
[22:54] <03tom> "It's always with the bullshit capital-letter-and-a-number passwords, y'know?"
[22:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Just use a sentence."
[22:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You can remember a lot of numbers and funny punctuation if it means something."
[22:55] <03Crion> 4Cav: "For stuff where password security isn't super-important -- you know, stuff without my credit cards on it -- I don't remember letters or numbers. I do a physical pattern on the keyboard, remember it that way. But, you know. Gangrel."
[22:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What's your favorite Bible verse?"
[22:56] <03Crion> 4Austin 3:16, Cavanaugh doesn't say out loud.
[22:56] <03Crion> 4Nineties kid.
[22:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cav's a man who respects the bottom line.
01[22:56] <03banana> "Surely it's Ezekiel 25:17," 6KJ says out loud.
[22:56] <03tom> "Well.. I'm a bit of a corny dope, so it has to be the twenty-third Psalm."
[22:57] <03tom> "But now I can't use that, because I told you what it is," 14he cries.
[22:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Just pick one you remember, and make your password that. 'Psalms24:9' with the capital letter and the colon and so on is a fine password."
[22:59] <03tom> "Yeah, okay, got it."
01[23:00] <03banana> 6KJ: "Okay, well, I'll update you somehow. Nice to meet you guys, though. It'll be nicer without the fear-sweat bath."
[23:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Eh. You get used to that. I keep deodorant handy."
[23:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Least we didn't have to kill anyone."
[23:01] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Putting Sponger aside for a minute -- I'm going to have to file a report about this with the Sheriff. Or with someone downtown. I'd like to know now if there's anything you want kept out of that, or if you want to contribute to it."
[23:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You gonna mention the ghosts?"
[23:01] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That's what I was tip-toeing around. I was going to keep that stuff vague."
[23:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Works for me."
[23:02] <03Crion> 4Cav: "We went in there, place was wrecked, two dead Acolytes, something big and mean in the woods, we experienced weird sensory phenomena, we grabbed Sponger and got out."
[23:02] <03tom> "That's fine to me, I mean.. there's nothing we were doing that wasn't above-board."
[23:03] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Nothing we knew about, at least."
[23:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh, that reminds me."
[23:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson fishes into his breast pocket. "I found this down in the basement. I don't really remember how, kind of a haze down there."
[23:03] <03tom> "Also Wilson conked out for like... fifteen minutes there. That's really not good for you."
[23:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's the poem.
[23:04] <03Crion> 4He grimaces. "There's no ban on going out there as far as I know, and we were on Court business, but vampire law is a bit more tolerant of ex post facto judgments than mortal law is."
[23:04] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Huh."
[23:05] <03Crion> 4Cav will want to compare the handwriting with the Franks journal he's got.
[23:05] <03Crion> 4Given that he has the journal on him, this shouldn't be a problem.
[23:07] <03Quaker> It’s an easy match. 
01[23:07] <03banana> 6In this case the only judgement likely would be 'you had it coming, going off the map like that'. 
[23:08] <03Crion> 4Baron Anaheim's gotta loosen up. Live a little. Die a little.
[23:08] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, Thomas Franks wrote it, alright."
01[23:09] <03banana> 6KJ really wants to get out of here to somewhere civilised. She liked the hills better when they were sunlit half the time.. unfortunately she didn't drive herself. So she's hanging around ruffled until someone else wants to leave or it starts to be worth calling an Uber. 
01[23:09] <03banana> "I never knew Franks."
[23:09] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Beyond that, well. I'm not a poetry guy. That said..." 4Cav will snap a picture of it with his phone.
01[23:10] <03banana> "Lot of references to the daytime sun."
[23:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'd invite you back to my place for drinks and further discussion, but--"
[23:10] <03Crion> 4He pauses.
[23:10] <03Crion> "Tommy."
[23:10] <03tom> 14Tommy does not have a car, so he's already called an uber for Sponger and himself. How bloody is the nosferatu, and how hard will it be to conceal that to the driver?
[23:10] <03tom> "Yeah?"
[23:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You think it might be worth us getting some personal face time in with Sponger first? Before Soria."
[23:10] <03Crion> "Just so there aren't any surprises."
[23:10] <03tom> 14He glances up from his phone, briefly annoyed, then softens his expression.
[23:10] <03tom> "It couldn't hurt."
01[23:11] <03banana> 6..
[23:11] <03Crion> 4Cav's manor isn't far from here, and he's still got a couple unfurnished rooms in the North Wing. Rooms that Sponger can bleed all over, if he has to.
01[23:11] <03banana> 6..technically this is exactly the sort of thing KJ is meant to keep an eye and an ear on.
[23:12] <03Quaker> Hey, where is Sponger, by the way? The Land Rover is empty. 
01[23:12] <03banana> "Well, if this thing's not over yet."
[23:12] <03Crion> 4To Wilson and KJ: "Invitation's extended to you, too."
[23:12] <03tom> 14Tommy turns and shuffles over to the car, where he knocks on the rim over the door. "Hey dude, you feeling any better?"
01[23:12] <03banana> "Remind me, what did he even do?"
[23:12] <03tom> "Oh shit, really?"
[23:12] <03tom> "Dude, we fuckin' lost him already."
[23:12] <03Crion> "Sorry Sponger, you don't really have a--" 4Wait, where is-- "Oh son of a bitch."
[23:13] <03tom> "God damn it!"
01[23:15] <03banana> 6lmfao
[23:15] <03Quaker> While the rest look around, Wilson is the first to hear the creak of the metal gate leading to the main road. It swings open just a bit as Sponger, trying to maintain his cloak of shadow, limps towards the main road. 
[23:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson whistles and points at the gate.
01[23:17] <03banana> 6KJ is chuckling as she jogs over that way. Also, her jog speed is faster than the Land Rover was.
[23:17] <03Crion> 4This is just sad.
[23:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Perfect end to a perfect night."
01[23:17] <03banana> 6Certainly faster than it is in its present state. Shadows flash and blood boils - just a tiny bit of blood. She's in Sponger Souza's way.
[23:19] <03tom> 14Tommy reaches into his hoodie and rips the shotgun free from his back. There's still a long strand of duct tape twisting in the wind on the barrel as he levels it at the gate. "Come the fuck on, man."
[23:20] <03Crion> 4When Cav gets Buchanan and Rush on the phone, he tells them to take the office phone off the hook for the rest of the night -- at least until they hear otherwise from Cav on their personal cells.
[23:20] <03Quaker> The Nosferatu is quite a bit larger than the diminutive Baron Anaheim…but when he makes contact with her along his escape trajectory, he falls over into the dirt, trembling and wheezing. 
[23:21] <03tom> 14Tommy saunters over and roughly grabs the nosferatu by the back of his collar, hoisting him back up onto his knees.
[23:22] <03tom> "Dude, if you don't get with the program right now, I swear to God I'm going to hand you over so fast."
01[23:22] <03banana> 6KJ bends down. At more than 60 mph, she's left the others behind momentarily. Before the Deacon arrives, she shows the escapee something glinting in her hand. "Whatever you did, you'll be judged by merit and politics. But you can't escape the Invictus. Get used to it"
[23:23] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Throw him in my trunk. One of the girls will keep him company."
[23:23] <03tom> 14He shakes Sponger, gentler this time. "We're trying to help you, man, don't make this weird."
01[23:24] <03banana> 6Are we? Better get on with it, then.
[23:24] <03tom> 14He gets up and dusts off his palms. "C'mon, it's not far." 14He turns to Cav. "Right?"
[23:24] <03Crion> 4Once he's in the trunk, Shots will hop in after him, and settle down on his chest, glaring at the Nosferatu. Should make it more difficult for him to run off again.
[23:30] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah, just back out to Laguna."
[23:30] <03Quaker> An hour later, in Laguna Canyon ——
[23:32] <03Crion> 4Cav's place is perhaps modest by some standards in these hills, but it's still a mansion -- an iron-gated and tree-lined perimeter leading up a short driveway to the front walk and imposing front doors -- the main foyer is at the intersection of two two-story wings, one stretching west towards the coast and the other north, meeting in a sort of hub area.
[23:34] <03Crion> 4It's in a modern American style: nondescript, not a lot of windows, some McMansion influence but with enough high quality materials and craftsmanship in the building (as well as a large enough plot of land and square-footage) to not make it feel cheap.
[23:35] <03Crion> 4Shots and Honey will immediately hop out of the car and stalk off into the underbrush, leaving Cav and whoever else tagged along with a no-longer-catted Sponger Souza.
01[23:35] <03banana> 6KJ's sticking to him like glue at this point. She likes it when they try to run! But not more than once.
[23:37] <03Quaker> Sponger, the fight taken out of him, follows meekly up to the doors. “What now?” 
[23:37] <03tom> 14Tommy is holding the shotgun in hand as he rounds the back of the car to escort Sponger. "We're just going to ask some questions, really."
01[23:38] <03banana> 6Dull but not unpleasant. Plenty of room for 'the girls'.
[23:38] <03Crion> 4They'll drag him through the front door, then, and into the main foyer-space -- the floor plan for this hub area is fairly open, with stairs leading up to the second level lining either wall and a wide arch leading underneath the stairs through a kitchen and out to the backyard. It's very clean, furnished, and well-maintained, if a bit spartan. But Cav directs them down the hallway 
[23:38] <03Crion> 4on the left, into the North Wing, which more or less appears unfinished. Well. Unlived in.
01[23:38] <03banana> "Then I'll write down the answers, and with enough of them everything's likely to be fine, probably."
[23:39] <03Crion> 4Painted, but not furnished. He directs them into the second room on the right, which is literally just an empty white room with a hardwood floor, and a thick black tarp over the only window.
[23:39] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll be right back."
[23:39] <03Crion> 4He returns with chairs and an unassuming table.
[23:40] <03Crion> 4Then he pulls a charger cord for his iPhone out of a pocket, plugs it in, and sets it down on the table after tapping a few buttons. It's recording.
[23:41] <03Crion> 4Cav: "April..."
[23:41] <03Crion> 4Shit, what's the date?
[23:41] <03Crion> 4He leans over to check the phone.
[23:43] <03Crion> "April 18th, 2016. Session with Sponger Souza. Baron Laguna, with Baron Anaheim and Deacon Saldana."
[23:43] <03tom> 14Tommy reaches into his hoodie and, with an embarrassed look, pulls out an electronic vaporizor.
[23:43] <03Quaker> Where’d Wilson go? 
[23:44] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I guess the first thing, Sponger, is to make sure you know why we're having this conversation."
01[23:44] <03banana> 6KJ sits on one end of the table, kicking her legs a bit. Still feels wet, like the drizzle in Santiago Canyon permeated all clothing. She's got a phone out too, tapping rather than recording.
[23:46] <03Quaker> The Nosferatu looks into space, sitting at the head of the table. “Beat Cosmo Morgan within an inch of his life. Should have gone all the way. Then you would be hunting down a murderer. Killed me out there. Spared me being turned over to Bren.” 
[23:46] <03tom> 14Tommy crosses his arms and slouches back into the chair. He exhales a fine mist that smells vaguely like citrus.
[23:46] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Where'd you do it?"
[23:47] <03tom> 14He chuckles at Sponger's comment, but doesn't elaborate. This is the public record, of course.
[23:48] <03tom> 14The Deacon can't exactly say what they're all thinking.
[23:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cora took him home. He's had enough of other people, living and dead, for the night. For ever, really, but the ghosts can leave him alone tonight. Once they pull in to Misty Dream - a sprawling and withdrawn complex Wilson bought when a million dollars went a lot farther than it does now - he lets Nora and Cora off the hook. Since he's not injured or sleeping in the office, they call 
[23:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10it a win and go about their business. Wilson doesn't pry.
01[23:48] <03banana> 6At the very least, KJ can sympathise with not being wanting to be put in the hands of Donald Bren. 
01[23:49] <03banana> 6It's not a nice place to be, here.
[23:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson spends the evening much as he'd have spent it in the office, except instead of watching Netflix on a computer screen he's watching Doctor Zhivago in the 30-seat projector room. He fired up the popcorn popper, even - he didn't like popcorn even when he was alive, but it'll do for warmth until the rye kicks in.
[23:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's got his phone on, even though he expects no calls. What's the point of having your own theater if you can't be rude in it?
[23:53] <03Quaker> “Little restaurant called Albertacos. In the parish. Open all night. Don’t bother me when I sit in the corner. I spend time reading. Talking to people. Used to sit on the pier in Dana Point. But. You know. Plus, you moved in.” He looks at Cav. “Didn’t know how you felt about us. Told Soria I’d keep to myself. I did.” 
[23:54] <03Crion> 4Cav can't decide if it's good or bad that this didn't happen on his turf. Lessens his leverage to get involved, but that cuts both ways."
[23:54] <03tom> "Wait, in Parish turf?"
01[23:54] <03banana> 6KJ would like to know whether Clinton Cavanaugh does feel about the Orange parish! But she'd also like to not be audible on this recording. It's a sad dilemma.
[23:54] <03tom> "I was told it happened in Dana Point."
[23:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wouldn't it have been lovely if we'd met before?
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Before we did? Yes.
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We'd have got married, had a house and children. If we'd had children, would you like a boy or girl?
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10I think we may go mad if we think about all that.
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10I shall always think about it.
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This was Laura's favorite movie.
[23:57] <03Quaker> Sponger: “I saw him. He saw me. I left. He followed. To…another Albertacos.” He coughs. “Franchise. That one was in Dana Point. Guess old habits don’t go away.” 
[23:58] <03tom> "Fuck."
[23:59] <03tom> 14He scratches his chin and thinks for a second. "Laguna, does it count in our favor if it started on parish territory?"
[23:59] <03Crion> 4Cav: "So Morgan followed you into my barony. Did he threaten or provoke you, either in the parish or in Dana Point?"
Session Time: Sun Apr 02 00:00:01 2017
[00:00] <03Crion> 4To Tommy: "Well, walking into the same restaurant as someone else is no crime." 4Perhaps a bit ironic, considering how the two of them met.
01[00:00] <03banana> 6And why was Cosmo following- ah fuck. There's a trace on the firewall.
[00:00] <03tom> "I mean... this is the Invictus we're talking about, here."
01[00:01] <03banana> 6Ok, in a sec it'll be obvious there's someone on the network, so.. KJ taps a note out, holds up her phone so Cav can see it. <Got wireless password?>
[00:01] <03Crion> 4Slightly distracted, Cav nods and holds out his hand for her phone. Seems he wants to enter it himself, rather than put it on the recording.
[00:02] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Yes. He said something at the first place…I tried not to hear it. Thought I had shaken him. But he showed up in Dana Point. Told me he wanted to talk to me. I said no thanks. Maybe not as politely as I should. He got hot. I got hot. Went into the bathroom to cool off before I did anything stupid. He followed.” 
01[00:02] <03banana> 6Tap-tap. Screens change. He gets a rose-gold iPhone open to the wifi password screen - trying to connect to twitter.com.
[00:03] <03Crion> 4Cav enters the wifi password and hands the phone back. "Who threw the first punch?"
01[00:04] <03banana> 6KJ smiles brilliantly, makes sure not to get any of it on Souza.
[00:05] <03tom> 14Tommy can't help but hold a grimace as Sponger starts to answer. Either way, this looks really bad.
[00:06] <03Crion> 4There might be a self-defense case here. In any event, Morgan chasing Sponger into Cav's territory gives him some tenuous reason to stay involved, here.
01[00:07] <03banana> 6..is every system on this network a Mac?
[00:07] <03Crion> 4It is.
[00:07] <03Quaker> Sponger: “I did. He got in my face, screaming. About us. Carmelites. Idiots. Freaks. Scum. Deserved everything we got, should have all died down South, what we deserved. Said he looked forward to Soria getting his. I tried to leave. He was in my way. He…ripped off my bandana.” The Nosferatu gently touches the red and blue checkered cloth. “I put his head through the sink. Then broke the toilet tank’s cover over him. Then kicked until
[00:07] <03Quaker> he wasn’t moving.” 
[00:08] <03Quaker> Why was Laura there, of all places? 
[00:08] <03Crion> 4Well, there's one exception -- there's a monitor Cav has set up in the upstairs conference room to display as a second screen from his iMac in that room, and it's got its own node on the network, but it's not a fully functional PC or anything. Just a monitor with wifi.
[00:08] <03tom> "Okay," 14says Tommy. "Can we contest.. you know, that? The Invictus has its own rules for this sorta thing, right?"
[00:09] <03tom> "Calling us assholes has to count against Cosmo and his guys, right?"
[00:09] <03Crion> 4Cav frowns. Cosmo Morgan's a little piece of shit, but this sounds a bit more...pro-active than Cav remembers him being.
[00:09] <03Crion> 4Cav: "It's Sponger's word against Morgan's, unless we can call witnesses."
[00:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Who knows. Who the fuck knows what was going on there? Who knows what Franks got himself into before he went bad and mad and dead? Who knows what witchy hell the Acolytes made of his grave?
[00:10] <03tom> "Well, I mean, there's like.. there's some bullshit we've got so people tell the truth."
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson doesn't. All he can do is try to drive enough railroad spikes into his brain that he stops thinking about it.
[00:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "In that direction: were there any other Kindred in either restaurant that witnessed your encounters with Morgan outside of the restroom?"
[00:10] <03tom> "Laguna, maybe we can pull some surveillance footage?"
[00:11] <03tom> "Not from any bathroom but.. if it happened in a restaurant.."
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What was she doing at the office?
[00:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Cameras won't help us. And I doubt Bren has any intention of giving you access to Morgan to do the truth ritual on him."
01[00:13] <03banana> 6KJ: "Why does it matter?"
01[00:13] <03banana> "I've met Morgan. He'd probably admit to everything he said."
[00:13] <03tom> "I mean, we might be able to tell if a blur is attacking another.."
01[00:13] <03banana> "None of it's within the Iudex's purview. Being mean isn't a crime."
[00:14] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Physically blocking Sponger from leaving the restroom, however, is false imprisonment."
01[00:15] <03banana> "If you want to argue provocation it's believable. Your remedies are political. The Sanctum can and should sanction Morgan, keep him out of their territories, warn people so he's on notice."
01[00:16] <03banana> 6Doesn't change much for our dude here.
[00:16] <03Quaker> Sponger: “No. I was…not in the mood to talk to anyone before. Didn’t want to see anybody I knew. I called a friend afterward. They told me what would probably happen. I got my things and left for the canyons. Thought I would leave for someplace else. Bad luck, what happened afterward. Guess worse luck to not just die.” 
[00:16] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And what did happen afterward?"
[00:17] <03Crion> "What did we see out there, when we came to get you?"
01[00:17] <03banana> 6KJ: "Bullshit it was. You're probably gonna have a tough time, Souza, but surviving is always better."
[00:17] <03tom> 14Tommy taps his finger on the tabletop, exhales slowly.
01[00:18] <03banana> 6Is that code for 'you're not helping'..? Well, anyway.
01[00:19] <03banana> 6Fucking Jobs. Trojans on these systems would probably get noticed after a while, which would be fine.. except that Baron Laguna knows who's been on his wireless. KJ's going to poke around passively instead, see what she can find and read and copy.
[00:20] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Who are you? No offense.” This at KJ. “Afterward…I took a bus out to Mission Viejo. Hitched a ride into the canyons. I knew the people out there have big lots. Lots of old cars on the properties. Not great security. Wouldn’t miss one, wouldn’t call it in for a while, if they did. Rain got worse as I went further in. Found the old house. I stayed there for a night waiting for the storm to clear. To…” He looks 
[00:20] <03Quaker> embarassed. “Pray. Read a bit. Think.” 
01[00:21] <03banana> 6Into a lull in the confession: "None taken, don't worry about it."
[00:21] <03Quaker> “Second night, the Acolyte showed up. Not saying anything I understood. He got me a bit. I got him a lot. Noticed I was…bleeding wrong. Too much, wouldn’t stop. I heard things out in the woods. Figured his friends would show up soon. Bolted the door. Figured better to die in there than get taken away to…” He trails off. 
[00:23] <03Crion> 4Cav: "What'd you get him with? Your fists?"
01[00:26] <03banana> 6Not a lot of stuff here on the good Baron's future activities.. but email has both contacts and quite a trove on the communications of the Shepherds. KJ sets it all copying to a proxy - the phone's got room, but logs won't show anything being sent to a local device. 
[00:29] <03Crion> 4At the very least they can try to pull the security cameras in both restaurants to confirm the general outline of Sponger's story.
[00:30] <03Crion> 4Maybe they'll catch something else, too, that Sponger missed or left out.
[00:33] <03Quaker> “Yeah. That and a loose brick.” 
01[00:33] <03banana> "And his knife, right? The bleeding thing."
[00:34] <03Crion> 4So Morgan had no idea how hard Sponger could hit before picking a fight with him. If nothing else, Morgan's a Masquerade danger -- pursuing Sponger to public places to instigate a fight with a guy that strong.
[00:37] <03Quaker> “He fell on it. Or he must have caught himself with its edge. I just know I saw blood on it, but that was before he got me with it.” 
[00:39] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, the good news is that no one's going to prosecute you for that. Might actually speak to your character as a member of the Court."
[00:41] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Did you...experience any odd spatial or sensory phenomena, while inside the Franks estate?"
[00:42] <03Quaker> Sponger: “What?” 
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Visions. Hallucinations. Ghosts. Anything like that."
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav has quietly paused recording for this last exchange.
[00:44] <03Quaker> “…Did you?” 
01[00:44] <03banana> 6KJ: "There was definitely a mental manipulator active."
[00:44] <03Crion> 4Cav: "First question you evade on, and it's this one."
[00:48] <03Quaker> Sponger: “The first night I prayed. I heard…things. Whispers. Nothing I could make out. Didn’t really know what to make of it. Then…when I passed a mirror, I saw that my…face…was normal. Like it was before. I had…dreams. Then nothing.” 
[00:48] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Hrmmm."
[00:49] <03Crion> 4Should go back and burn that place to the ground.
01[00:50] <03banana> "Of course, you were bleeding to death from magical poison at the time. Coulda been an unusual state of mind."
[00:51] <03Quaker> “No. This was before.” 
[00:51] <03Crion> 4Does seem a bit less extreme than what they experienced, but perhaps the house's reaction is keyed to how many Kindred are in it...? If it is the house.
01[00:51] <03banana> "And there was nobody else around?"
[00:54] <03Quaker> “There was one person. An acquaintance. We spoke briefly. Surprised to see each othere there. Nothing important. She left after a few minutes. This was on the first night. But she was just passing through.” 
[00:54] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Joanie?" 4He still has the recorder off.
01[00:54] <03banana> "People use that place as a sanctuary?"
[00:55] <03Quaker> To Cav: “Yes.” To KJ: “I don’t think so. It felt like I was the first person there in a while.”  
[00:56] <03Quaker> “Wait, how did you know?” 
[00:57] <03Crion> 4Cav decides to split the difference. "There was something she wasn't telling me, and she's the only Dana Point regular who's even remotely safe out there."
[00:57] <03Quaker> Wilson can hear the phone ring somewhere in the house. 
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Christ.
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The landline?
[00:58] <03Quaker> Indeed. 
[00:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nearest phone is in the theatre foyer. Wilson'll stagger out to the sound of blu-ray menu music and answer the phone. "Yeah?"
01[00:59] <03banana> "You don't think so. Then why is there a steel-lined safe room? New construction."
[01:00] <03Quaker> “Operator, get me Wilson Frost - oh, you put me through - Wilson, this is Blythe. Hello?” It’s Countess Lancaster. 
[01:00] <03Crion> 4Cav's switched the recorder back on.
[01:01] <03Quaker> Sponger: “I don’t know. Wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.” 
[01:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson smooths out the rumples in his shirt, as if she'd walked into the room and caught him in arrears. "Blythe! How are you doing?"
[01:02] <03Quaker> “I heard you were out and about in the company of our mutual acquaintance from New York. Anything exciting?” 
[01:08] <03Quaker> Sponger: “What are you going to do with me?” 
01[01:08] <03banana> 6KJ's gone silent again, then. Mostly it's just a habit.
[01:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks at the clock. How is it already 3? Whatever. He doesn't have the faculties to lie. "Witches and ghosts. We schlepped out to Thomas's old place to pick up the guy who keyed up Bren's gofer. I went out to help Vincent and Sauer, I brought Valentine out to network. Cavanaugh wanted to throw Bren a little elbow. A classic Invictus night out."
[01:09] <03Crion> 4Cav: "We're going to hand you over to Soria and his people, where I surmise they'll ask you most of the same questions we asked you here. Up to a point."
01[01:09] <03banana> 6Also a chance to concentrate. Hm. If it's not safe to bug the guy.. what, is she going to have to fallback on friendship and being a genuinely helpful, interesting person? Christ. Piece of cake, though. 
[01:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "In the meantime, I'm going to explore my options for redress as the Baron of a territory where a Kindred pursued one of my tenants, falsely imprisoned him in a public place, and repeatedly either broke Masquerade or attempted to break Masquerade by discussing Kindred politics around Kine and provoking a fight where there was no recourse but the use of Disciplines."
[01:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Place was haunted, Blythe. I saw Laura."
[01:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "God only knows what the others saw."
[01:11] <03Quaker> He can hear Lancaster pause on the other end. “Are you alright?” 
[01:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "That may mean a lighter sentence for you. One can hope, at least. At the very least, this is now a very political situation."
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's not the first time."
[01:12] <03Crion> 4Too bad the Court probably doesn't have hate crime laws.
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The week before the opera Sauer came doorknocking. Saw Laura that night too."
[01:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't know. What's alright?"
01[01:13] <03banana> 6KJ finds the laptop he's got open in another room, brings up whatever Macs have instead of notepad. Leaves a window open, large font: 
01[01:13] <03banana> "Dude, you should invest in network security - this thing comes up on autoping. Call me if you want tips. 
01[01:13] <03banana> K. J. Valentine, Anaheim 555-0199"
[01:13] <03Quaker> Sponger: “You could always let me go. Put me on a bus out of town. You’re the only ones who have seen me.” 
[01:13] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Then Tommy here gets to eat your rap."
[01:13] <03Crion> "So, no."
01[01:14] <03banana> 6KJ: "We're not going to save you, Souza. We're going to be fair to you. That includes taking into account the nature of the asshole you assaulted."
[01:16] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Well. I suppose if it started before the opera, I can feel a bit less guilty about asking you to get involved with Baron Laguna’s…whatever it is. What happened?” 
01[01:16] <03banana> "Are we done?"
[01:16] <03Crion> 4Cav will release Sponger into Tommy's care with a promise to follow up the next night, unless he's got anything else to say.
[01:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "She died and it was my fault."
[01:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh. At Franks's."
[01:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He tells her what he remembers. Which, miserably, is everything.
[01:21] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “That’s a lot to digest.” He can hear her, predictably, try to lighten the moment. “Hopefully it doesn’t give you a stomach ache.” Not being very good at it, she moves on. “I’ll inform the Prince. I imagine that you’re going to keep pursuing your…personal connection. Unless you think that it’s just a coincidence.” 
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What's there to pursue?"
[01:24] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Why is Palmer appearing? Why did you see her there, of all places? I don’t recall her having any public connection to anyone in the Orange Court.” 
[01:25] <03Quaker> Sponger follows Tommy quietly. From their chatter, the Barons can make out that he’ll be sharing Soria’s basement with the Deacon for now. 
[01:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Dunno. Seems like the most p- parsimonious explanation is just that I saw it cause it was in my head."
01[01:25] <03banana> 6KJ: "Good luck, Deacon. I'll get you that info some time soon."
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Doesn't really make sense otherwise."
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But I don't know from magic really."
01[01:26] <03banana> 6She's going to get a driver too - still too expensive from here but it's a hell of a lot better than the fare from Modjeska. Might as well clarify one last thing with Mr. Cavanaugh, though.
[01:27] <03Crion> 4Cav returns from the kitchen, where he's put on a pot of tea for himself, having finished locking up the North Wing.
[01:27] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Heading out, then?"
01[01:27] <03banana> "Yep. Now, stop me if this is crazy talk, but I get the impression you'd rather Sponger Souza come out ahead when this goes to the Iudex."
[01:28] <03Crion> 4Cav grimaces. "Why, whatever gave you that idea."
01[01:33] <03banana> 6KJ puts her phone away. She likes these kind of conversations, on the edge of leaving - something about their interstitiality, hurried and relaxed at the same time.
01[01:33] <03banana> "Basically literally everything?"
[01:34] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Maybe the things you found will make some sense to the Baron Laguna. In that case, I expect he’ll ask you for further favors. I can’t pretend I don’t have a personal stake in the looming struggle I think I sense developing down there…but you don’t. I suppose it’s up to you.” She hesitates. “You know…it’s odd. Whenever my social life begins to stir, I find myself growing distant from my other interests. I 
[01:34] <03Quaker> suppose my servants can tend to the gardens for now, but…one focus can’t expand without the other receding. But if your established routine is too dear to you at this time, I’d understand.” 
01[01:34] <03banana> "If you need any more work on this just ask. It's interesting. I'm not on his side, though. Or against it."
[01:35] <03Crion> 4Cav chuckles drily. "Sponger is a friend of friends, and Cosmo Morgan was a piece of shit before he started picking fights in public while ranting about Kindred politics."
[01:35] <03Crion> 4He pauses. "I'll do that, thanks. Just...this will put you on Donald Bren's radar."
[01:35] <03Crion> "I'm already there, so that's no trouble to me."
[01:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What should I do?"
[01:36] <03Crion> "But if we do take this to the Judex and get it overturned -- or get Morgan sanctioned -- he won't be happy."
01[01:37] <03banana> 6KJ: "Ugh."
[01:38] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Such is the cost of not staying home every night."
[01:38] <03Crion> "Believe me, I'm tempted."
01[01:38] <03banana> "Nah. Half the point of what we do is that we get invited to all the parties."
[01:39] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, that's the good news at least. Bren's not a real party kind of guy."
01[01:39] <03banana> "OK, got to go. I'll handle Lord Bren if his people get mad at me just for knowing you. Possibly by, you know, being destroyed and devoured."
01[01:39] <03banana> "Possibly more gracefully. Enjoy the dry part of the night."
[01:40] <03Crion> 4Cav: "G'night, Baron Anaheim."
[01:40] <03Crion> 4She'll get a call ten minutes later on her phone.
[01:41] <03Crion> 4It'll open with a bemused, "You know, I gave you the wifi password."
[01:41] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “You know me. Given the choice between trying to ignore your past, and rising above it, I always choose the latter. Well. Usually. After a few decades. My therapist says I’m making progress. Haha.” 
[01:41] <03Quaker> She adds, after a few moments. “I don’t really have a therapist. That was a joke.” 
[01:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Does that invitation to come see the flowers still stand?"
01[01:43] <03banana> 6KJ, in an Uber: "Haha! Baron- Cav- you're not meant to be able to get into peoples' computers just by being on their network. That's, like, a basic part of the IP threat model."
[01:43] <03Quaker> “Always.” 
01[01:43] <03banana> "The trouble is, nobody really needs to ask you for that password- ok, have you heard of the internet of things?"
[01:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Vaguely. Something about internet toasters."
[01:43] <03Crion> "I don't have one."
01[01:44] <03banana> "OK, well, by 2018 you are probably not gonna be able to buy a non-smart TV- the thing is, even routers are insecure now. Trust me, someone could get into your network from the outside, and you don't want that to be game over."
01[01:45] <03banana> "Do you ever go to the uh, the apple thing- the Genius bar? Next time you're there, get them to put a password on stuff. Maybe install Little Snitch. It's a tool that shows you if anything is initiating network transfers on your system."
[01:45] <03Crion> 4Cav: "...Right. Thanks for the advice."
[01:46] <03Crion> 4The pause appears to be him writing things down on a notepad in front of him, not one of suspicion.
[01:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Tomorrow night. Tonight I think I need to turn in early. Before the ghosts get me."
01[01:47] <03banana> "I take it you weren't a programmer in your previous life?"
[01:47] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I was in financial services. So no."
[01:48] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “If you’re still feeling…about Palmer. Laura. It wasn’t going to end until they found the last one in the court. And she wasn’t innocent of the charges. You didn’t do anything wrong.” 
[01:49] <03Quaker> “But yes. Tomorrow.” 
01[01:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "That would be 'so yes' these days. It's all computers now."
01[01:49] <03banana> "About the only thing we can't and shouldn't automate is the hunt."
[01:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's a long silence. Then: "Good night, Blythe."
[01:50] <03Quaker> “Goodnight.” 
[01:50] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Modern banking is the hunt. Especially when financiers and investment banks are involved."
01[01:50] <03banana> 6KJ: "So they liked to think before 2008. We'll see how bloodless it becomes.."
[01:51] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, I got out at the right time regardless."
[01:51] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But yeah, thanks for the tips. I'm sure we'll have cause to discuss them further. This Bren thing probably isn't going away."
01[01:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "No, it.. isn't likely to. See you around, Clinton Cavanaugh." 
01[01:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "Wait! I forgot. The club."
[01:54] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Hm?"
[01:54] <03Crion> "Oh."
[01:54] <03Crion> "Book club, right."
01[01:55] <03banana> "Yeah, for the new cohort! We'll pick a name if it turns out people are into it. I'll DM you the invite."
[01:55] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Sounds good."
01[01:57] <03banana> "See you around, for real." 6She's gone. It's still a long ride - the roads are empty at this time of night but for some reason they hit every red light, because this IS L.A. traffic - but it's fine. KJ has a lot of decompressing to do.
[01:57] <03Quaker> Actually, it’s Orange County traffic-
01[01:58] <03banana> 6Only when she can't help these trips to the boonies.
[01:58] <03Crion> 4Cav, meanwhile, will return to his study. He'll call Rush and Buchanon, telling them to start forwarding calls to him again, and then settle in with a book -- Frank's journal -- and that snapshot of a poem. And some other works from his 'legal library.'
[01:58] <03Crion> 4Should keep him busy the rest of the night.
01[02:06] <03banana> 6Nobody's left in the office when KJ gets back, and if there's a report on the weird bullets or a taunt from Frances she doesn't have time for them. Better just reach out to a couple of old friends about this code- there's always a hacker out there who'll accept a challenge without knowing the details.
[02:08] <03Quaker> As Cav settles in with the journal, he can read the two entries he deciphered previously. The rest, as he quickly remembers, remains hidden, encoded with an undecipherable one-time-pad code. Unfortunately, you’d need the code itself to get past the encryption. There’s no way to brute force it, or even puzzle it out by trying all the combinations. 
[02:08] <03Quaker> He can hear Shots and Honey play-wrestling in the back. 
[02:08] <03Quaker> Wait,
[02:09] <03Crion> 4Maybe there's something in the po--
[02:11] <03Quaker> Frances left a voicemail - “Hi K.J., just wondering if you were busy…there’s a new club in Costa Mesa that’s supposed to exciting. Or, I could tell them to open up Disneyland for a few hours. Um, or if you’d just like to come over and watch movies…call me back when you get a chance? Hope you’re having a good time, bye-“ 
01[02:13] <03banana> 6That monster. Suggesting entertaining activities when it's too late to get to any of them?! A classic revenge move.
01[02:14] <03banana> 6They are absolutely going to the club tomorrow night though.
01[02:14] <03banana> 6Tonight was kind of.. expensive, after all.
[02:14] <03Quaker> And there’s a note from Wesley Fitzroy, who she asked about the bullets. Of course, he doesn’t stutter when writing with a pen. ‘Baron Valentine - these are special incendiary 7.62mm rounds manufactured by a firm that produces them on an exclusive contract for our Wilderness Commission. Actually, a case of these disappeared some time ago from our stores. How did you say you came by these again? Of course, if discretion is required on 
[02:14] <03Quaker> this, I’m happy to provide it.’ 
01[02:17] <03banana> 6Oh, she'll give him discretion.  
01[02:17] <03banana> 6..that didn't make much sense. The sun, the enemy, is weighing down on KJ from somewhere just below the rim of the earth. Time to depart.
[02:25] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh spends until near-dawn in the study, working feverishly. After an hour, he's given up on his phone and has written the poem out on one of his legal pads -- multiple times, in fact, until he's almost got it memorized. When the phone dies around 4 AM, he doesn't notice. He's almost got the third stanza cracked.
[02:37] <03Quaker> This is…jumbled. Actually, it’s complete nonsense. At 430, he realizes that he’s looking in the wrong direction. The poem isn’t the code. But when did…oh. But that means that she…ah. Well, at least he knows who has it. 
[02:38] <03Quaker> Before she falls asleep, or dead, depending on who you ask, KJ gets an email back from her old contact in Minneapolis. “OTP key. No idea what it’s connected to, sorry. You need to find the text it’s made for.”

[08:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Xalvierre and his student can't countenance your plan, but neither can they hope to stop it. You're sure at this point that the center of the Hedgehog range is free of mortal bystanders... but can't say the same for either of the faerie freeholds.
[08:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's phase two.
[08:21] <03Crion> 4Time to post the set list and kick off this show.
[08:24] <03dammitwho> 7Here we go.
[08:25] <03trenchfoot> 6Showtime.
[08:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Getting into the bowels of the night court will be easy, of course, but day's trickier - it's higher in the sky than the Stormwind Rider goes. Eikichi visited last time by the grace of a couple knights willing to create a path for him, but unless you can pull that off a second time you'll have to either teleport or take the Heavensward out of all those mothballs you're storing it 
[08:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12in. Or something else that hasn't occurred to me.
[08:26] <03Crion> 4Well, that puts a dent in Ir's plan of just riding there.
[08:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Besides that, if you're to successfully pull the Cathak forces into your trap, you probably need to take some pains to ensure that they at Dorsal Point realize what you are and where you're going, and see no choice but to follow.
[08:26] <03Crion> 4...How the hell did mortals even get up there?!
[08:26] <03trenchfoot> 6Very carelessly.
[08:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Abducted, of course. The knights of the day court've got huge riding birds.
[08:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Just get the raksha to invite you. How hard can it be? I did it.
[08:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Best way to do that is to climb high on some mountain peak and... be interesting?
[08:28] <03Crion> 4Sigh.
[08:28] <03Crion> 4If she must.
[08:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12So anyway, who's going where and how?
[08:34] <03Crion> 4Ir's wandering to the top of the nearest mountain peak, it seems.
[08:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi and Blossom are headed to Dorsal Point, flying as low and close as they can get and closing the distance on foot, unless Blossom had another idea.
[08:35] <03dammitwho> 7No, that'll do. The question is, how to draw them out?
[08:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's heading up the mountain with Ir.
[08:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Might be easier to answer when we get there and take the lay of the land, but if we're going to get a bulk of the Blooded out into the mountains we're going to need to present them with a situation that demands an urgent response and make that the only one they have.
[08:40] <03Crion> 4She'll ride Errant up. Heavensward's a bit far away to stable him.
[08:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "So, while we shouldn't try to be spotted on our way over, it's not necessarily a bad thing if we are."
[08:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You think?"
[08:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir and Tatsuya have a bit of a climb ahead of them, minus whatever length of ride Eikichi was willing to give. It's an arduous one, but not geomantically so - there's less compulsion to press on without breaks, less of that intangible backwards pressure they felt earlier on Xalvierre's mountain. Indeed, the climb is an increasingly refreshing one as they get higher.
[08:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's a brief interruption as a small war party of pig-faced, spear-wielding creatures comes scrambling around a boulder-
[08:45] <03Crion> 4The good kind of refreshing, or the Wyld equivalent of feeling warm while you're freezing to death?
[08:45] <03Crion> "Yo."
[08:46] <03dammitwho> 7She nods. "Ideally, a harried scout would announce our presence just in time for us to collapse a mineshaft or something."
[08:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Makes sense. Where should we start?"
[08:48] <03Crion> 4It's a very, very aggressive "Yo," accompanied by a piercing stare and Ir leaning forward on her horse, Iscariot laid menancingly in spear form across her lap.
[08:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's the beginnings of a 'you idiots! we've ALL got spears-' moment until the moblins actually notice what they're dealing with. Then they're rapidly replaced with roughly humanoid dust clouds.
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12-scrambling around a boulder, but otherwise the trip is positively bracing. Indeed, once the treeline's behind you and a picturesque, lichen-dusted peak ahead, you can practically see the daytime court itself. From below, it's an agglomeration of huge, fluffy clouds backlit by honey-golden sunlight. The sky's a riot of blue, gold, and pink and there's a part of you that could just 
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12lie back and admire this forever.
[08:54] <03Crion> 4It's pretty, alright. Almost too bad about what they're going to do to it.
[08:54] <03trenchfoot> 6Almost.
[08:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Eikichi and Blossom are whirling across the Hedgehog, skating 'round the peaks and valleys so that in their journeys they only come across the occasional mortal foragers or mutated beasts. Either/or doesn't trouble them, of course - few things can reach as high as the stormwind rider and fewer still have any hopes of keeping pace with it.
[08:59] <03Crion> 4To Tatsuya: "Pretty, right? Don't believe it. It's fucking with your head."
[08:59] <03Crion> "Trying to, anyway."
[09:01] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Yeah! It's really p- huh?" 6He looks up to it again, then back to Ir with a confused look on his face. Realization spreads across him slowly, and he shakes his head. "Right. Sorry."
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Zenith and the Twilight crest a particular peak, and then it's mostly downhill from where they are - a few more mountains are in the way, but on as clear a day as this they've actually got line of sight to Dorsal Point proper and a good vantage from which to survey the large-scale logistical action of the satrapy as a whole. Prospects look good, actually, for anyone crazy enough 
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12to want to goad the Cathak into confrontation in the next few days.
[09:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12It looks like several contingents of forces have mobilized from the base at Dorsal Point and either made or are currently making their way across the plains to the Hedgehog proper. It looks, too, like several mineshafts already benefit from increased military presence. This doesn't include the one you already hit, but then, that one wasn't turning up the results the Cathak were 
[09:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12looking for.
[09:09] <03Crion> 4Iscariot begins softly humming a nursery rhyme about the evils of the taiga woodland folk who steal children away as they walk.
[09:09] <03Crion> *4Ir begins softly humming a nursery rhyme about the evils of the taiga woodland folk who steal children away as they walk.
[09:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12These troops are being well-organized, the two Solars can see - a lot of subtle optimizations involving terrain, orientation along roads, and the placement of what look like conscripts. Gyozin's a military genius (although that's just par for the course for most Exalts of his stature and experience), but the size and spread-out nature of the forces here speak of also having some 
[09:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12hardworking and talented lieutenants or sergeants or other intermediaries.
[09:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ugh. Where are all the slovenly, corrupt Dynasts when you need them?
[09:11] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya looks sheepish at first, but he's humming along by the time she gets to the second verse. The illusion's broken, apparently.
[09:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi and Blossom know from the maps they stole from Calza that there are three other major mineshafts being sunk by Cathak's mercenary sorcerers and engineers. One of them is too high up and too far north on the Hedgehog to credibly be searching for a sunken defense grid pylon - one presumes that they actually did find a good feathersteel deposit there and decided to capitalize 
[09:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12on it. The other two are deeper and more central, and either or both might be getting the Cathak where they want to go. Judging from tracks, wagon trails, and troop movements, both are being reinforced.
[09:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi espies, as he surveys the land, the glint of a spyglass catching sunlight - and is quick enough to simply pop the stormwind rider back down below the treeline. He's pretty sure he and Blossom haven't been seen.
[09:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12It is a question, though, how the two of them mean to cause full-on mine collapses or whatever.
[09:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They're well-prepared," 10Eikichi whispers to Blossom. There's nobody around for a hundred yalms at least but still. "Both mines are guarded."
[09:16] <03dammitwho> 7How can we get them to evacuate the mines?
[09:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Before long, Ir and Tatsuya - both, by virtue of stubborn resolve, proof against the wyld's temptations - have reached the end of the path they're climbing and set up station around the peak. In fact, Ir's impromptu performance ensures that 'long' doesn't even arrive before the fae do. Ir and Tatsuya both hear what sounds like some sort of commotion farther down on the mountain 
[09:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12(squawking, gibbering and growling, screams and poof-ing noises) before a pair of gold-clad knights come flapping up into view on huge, maroon-colored birds.
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom knows that mines are evacuated in the event of disaster of some sort or another - poisonous gas, monster attack, and so on. The Cathak aren't going to care very deeply for the locals they've conscripted and handed pickaxes, of course, but if conditions deteriorate to the point that workers are just going to die without even digging anything up there's no reason to keep 'em 
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12in there.
[09:21] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm. The problem here is, they might decide to deliberately keep the miners down there in order to prevent us from collapsing the shafts."
[09:22] <03Crion> 4When they arrive, Ir's playing a suitable tune on her now-fiddle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUCbKYKkDis
[09:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi presses his lips together. "They're using unskilled conscripts and sorcerers to staff this project, right?"
[09:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So if we can drive off the sorcerers, disrupt the spells, maybe destroy their elementals, then we won't need to collapse the shafts outright as long as we can present enough of a sense of urgency that trying to re-establish the dig won't be fast enough."
[09:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "In fact, simply delaying them might well contribute to that, because it gives the impression that we don't need much more time."
[09:25] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Distorting their spells would be a good start!"
[09:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What kind of a tactician is Gyozin?"
[09:31] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "An experienced one. He doesn't go in for tricks or clever tactics, he's just... seen everything. He's a disciplinarian, likes spear and shield walls... actually, the troop movements we saw weren't really his style, so there probably is someone or someones competent handling logistics."
[09:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Kalza, maybe?"
[09:35] <03@Ferrinus> "What ho!" 12says a pleasing voice in Riverspeak. It comes from one of the two daylit knights, who flips the visor of his helmet up to reveal pale, chiseled features which tend to come to points - visible here are the nose and chin. "Have the monsters stalking these lands bothered you overmuch, fair lady?"
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> 6Ir's alone, which they might consider unusual. Or maybe not, she seems like she can handle herself. Tatsuya is undetectable inside her shadow, which might feel weird when they take to the air.
[09:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Maybe, maybe not. You really only saw Kalza command like six of her own guys, and she mostly related to her miners as an overseer and taskmaster rathe than a military officer.
[09:38] <03Crion> "Not overmuch." 4Ir grins. It's got an edge to it. "You boys from the castle, then."
[09:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Yeah... anyway, there's not much more we can figure out by speculating. "So we should look for magic to pick apart, and magicians too, if it comes to that. What impression do you want to give them of us?"
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Faerie: "We are knights of the daylit court - defenders of these lands! What brings you so close to our doors?"
[09:41] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "What do you mean?"
[09:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well... they're going to see us, yeah? Should we come out like holy avengers to inspire the people, should we come out like mad demons to get them to move faster... this'll be their first direct experience of us. First impressions count!"
[09:46] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm a skald. Fiddler and warrior strong. Hair like thatch, voice like gold, blood burns hot and heart runs cold." 4She hops down off the old tree stump she'd been lounging on. "Best there is at what I do. Never met my better. Never met my match."
[09:46] <03Crion> 4Hope that's enough overweening pride for these guys.
[09:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10You can never have too much overweening pride.
[09:47] <03trenchfoot> 6That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about overweening pride to dispute it.
[09:49] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Holy avengers, of course! The story will spread beyond these lands."
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12The other knight, visor still down, actually crashes his lance against his shield a few times in appreciation. The first: "Well spoken! We in the Daylit Court have great appreciation for arts of all kinds. If you're as skilled as you say, you might even catch the eye of the princess...!"
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12He continues: "It's dangerous here, despite our best efforts. I, Avalleur, hereby extend an invitation, if you would care to shelter and ply your trade in our fair lands."
[09:50] <03Crion> 4She laughs. "And when I wish to move on?"
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Avalleur looks briefly confused. "To where?"
[09:51] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Maybe right back here."
[09:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Ir's shadow rolls its eyes.
[09:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Naturally, there is no change.
[09:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Avalleur: "...really?"
[09:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Okay." 10He takes a deep breath. "We probably won't be able to get much closer without them seeing us. Are you ready?"
[09:53] <03dammitwho> "Always." 7She looks at Eikichi sideways for a moment, then smiles. "Follow my lead."
[09:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh hell yes.
[09:54] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You're passing fine at answering questions with questions, sir knight." 4She stands and stretches. "But maybe my curiosity outweighs my wanderlust. Maybe I'd meet this princess of yours."
[09:54] <03Crion> "Maybe I'd win a boon."
[09:54] <03Crion> "Lead on."
[09:58] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom bursts out of their hiding place and sprints toward the nearest mine. She leaps effortlessly to the top of a tall boulder overlooking the camp, her face shrouded in shadows cast by the flames limning her arms... until her caste mark flares to life on her brow, marking her as a child of the Sun for all the sorcerers and miners to see!
[09:58] <03dammitwho> "Prepare for trouble!"
[09:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And make it double!"
[09:59] <03dammitwho> "To protect the world from devastation!"
[09:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To unite the peoples of every nation!"
[10:00] <03dammitwho> "To battle in the name of truth and love!"
[10:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "To restore peace to the stars above!"
[10:00] <03dammitwho> "Excessively Righteous Blossom!"
[10:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Eikichi Sho!"
[10:01] <03dammitwho> "Solar vengeance at the speed of light!"
[10:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Surrender now or prepare to fight!"
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> So there's basically two choices of mine to come charging out at - one which, in Eikichi's estimation, seems to be staffed by fewer miners but be making more active use of sorcery, and another which has considerably more conscripts - and considerably healthier-looking ones than usual, while at the same time having strangely few shipments of hammers, pickaxes, and actual tools. Which 
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> are you gonna crash first?

[10:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Avalleur looks much more comfortable with Ir's current line of inquiry. "Excellent, excellent! I'm sure our beauteous freehold will serve as ample inspiration for your arts, my lady." 12He pulls at the reins of his riding bird, causing it to shrug a shoulder and swerve off into a formation of sorts with the other knight. The two wheelin wide circles around you, and then 
[10:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12around a notional cylinder of air leading away. Before your eyes, a path of mallow-soft cloudstuff is traced through the sky, spiraling upwards towards the Daylit Court.
[10:11] <03Crion> 4Ir hops aboard Errant. Her grin hasn't faded. If anything, it's got even more of an edge.
[10:13] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, to Eikichi before they attack and do their cool intro: "Ah! They have an Earth-Shaping Jewel! Anyone who's touched the jewel within the last day can work stone by hand as if it were clay, so long as the jewel itself isn't moved. Steal that, and the whole mine comes to a stop."
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's very strange to ride Errant along the clouds - they're exactly as bouncy and elastic as they look, and there's a weird, resonating rubbery noise rather than the hooves-on-stone cadence Ir is used to. Still, it's plenty fast. In fact, it seems a bit faster than it should be, given the height of the clouds above the mountains, suggesting that someone's playing some kind of trick 
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12with distances or velocities to speed the journey.
[10:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12So it's in what only feels like a few minutes that Ir finds herself touching down in a broad, idyllic-looking town square. There's market stalls all around and broad streets stretching in every cardinal direction. Wooden signs depicting stylized swords, gems, or potions hang from poles or awnings. To the east is a great castle, pearly-white, with an adjoining church or temple of some 
[10:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12kind. Elsewhere are great fields where birds graze, some sort of barracks, a monastery or dojo, a sorcerers' tower...
[10:19] <03Crion> 4She's heading for the castle.
[10:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Avalleur advises Ir to investigate the inn, or simply join in the commotion of the market square, but seems to be a busy knight; he's almost immediately back off on patrol. Ir and her shadow are surrounded now by... townsfolk? Young or old, they're all clear-skinned and pointy-eared.
[10:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No, I think not."
[10:19] <03Crion> "Here's the thing about skalds, sir knight."
[10:20] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya will have to get away quickly - he can't stay a shadow for much longer, and popping out of Ir's shadow would draw some unwanted eyes. Is there somewhere nearby he can stop being a shadow and start being a thief?
[10:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Oh, yeah, that's easy. At midday the town market is crowded indeed, and Tatsuya's got endless opportunities to simply slip off into the crowd or down some alley or another.
[10:22] <03Crion> "We're wise in the old ways of the world. And like you, we have our traditions we must abide. You think I didn't know when I walked up those dreamclouds, that once I did, I couldn't leave? I knew. I did it because I don't want to leave...until you all are forced to let me."
[10:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Down in the mortal world, Blossom and Eikichi crest a cliff of jagged rock and sail straight through the air and line of sight of a small cabal of scandalized sorcerers.
[10:23] <03Crion> "You go up to that castle, sir knight. You tell that pretty princess the world of man has a challenge for her subjects. And then you tell her to find the best musician amongst you, and meet me at the crossroads."
[10:23] <03Crion> "Unless you're yellow."
[10:23] <03trenchfoot> 6He'll slip away, then, and keep an eye on Ir from, well, a different set of shadows. All eyes ought to be on her, anyhow, so staying hidden shouldn't be that difficult.
[10:24] <03Crion> 4...There better be some crossroads up here.
[10:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12This looks less like a mine than a firing range. There's a staging area of sorts on a wide plateau around which are rough cabins, supply stockpiles, and paths and railways leading further down the mountain. The center of the plateau's a wide circle carved into the very stone and decorated with occult symbols and inlaid gemstones of arcane significance. Before the circle is a mine 
[10:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12entrance itself, but it's almost perfectly circular and much wider than could possibly have been practical to dig by hand. There are wooden logs and beams set into the stone presumably just in case, but the general impression is that someone's been blasting rather than digging their way down into the mountain.
[10:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's eyes and brow burn golden, and his hair flutters in the wind to match. In his left hand he holds a hellish and hateful thing, while his right hand gently holds his chin as he smirks.
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12This impression is supported by the fact that four men and women in heavy leather robes are currently standing at significant points in the graven circle, shaping magic. Besides them, there's some of those hulking elementals, a contingent of guards in cathak colors, some miners whose chief pursuit seems to be hauling out the rubble that this sorcery leaves in its wake, and a 
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12dragon-blooded man with a sword and shield who's just stepped out of one of the cabins. You can tell because of the corona of flames around his head and shoulders.
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Cathak something-or-other, Blossom doesn't recognize him: "What-"
[10:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir finds that there are definitely crossroads up here. Hell, the market square is essentially the biggest crossroads in the freehold. If she's heading up to the castle, no one stops her... until she reaches its actual doors, that is.
[10:32] <03Crion> 4She'll head to the crossroads first, but if no one shows up to meet her -- or if the knight just acts aggrieved and confused rather than relaying the message -- then she'll head up to the castle.
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12The walk feels shorter than it actually is, especially when Ir looks behind herself - separating the castle from the main market square is plenty of rolling emerald hillside and one long cobblestone bridge arcing from one cloud to another. The castle itself is tall, white, immaculately clean, and surrounded by a moat of sparkling blue water that nevertheless contains a few huge green 
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12lizards that sort of lazily splash around. Right beside the castle, actually connected to it by a long, thin bridge of marble, is what must be the local church of Balor. It's an imposing structure of mostly upwards-pointing triangles whose stained glass windows are generally decked out in hues of red, orange, and purple and feature a lot of eye and sun iconography.
[10:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's hard to tell, incidentally, who up here is actually human. All the townsfolk seem to have things to do, even if those things are milling around and waiting to be spoken to.
[10:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12But like I was saying Ir, Ir isn't stopped until she reaches the castle doors. There, a pair of skinny, mustachioed guards with pointy helmets that dramatically cross their halberds before her just as she approaches the castle's main entrance.
[10:35] <03Crion> 4Ir's task-oriented. Indulging this fantasy world will only strengthen it.
[10:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12The guards are silent, and almost mechanical - when Ir steps back, their halberds uncross, but when she steps forward they cross again, and the farther forward she moves the more it feels like she's walking through molasses or pressing up against a physical wall. The implication is that she has to earn access to the castle by some means.
[10:42] <03Crion> 4Oh for the love of.
[10:42] <03trenchfoot> 6Are there any other ways in?
[10:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Probably...? It might involve scaling the wall or swimming the moat or finding and sneaking in through some kind of servant's entrance. Tatsuya would have to do some scouting.
[10:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Eikichi and Blossom are almost certainly joining battle.
[10:44] <03trenchfoot> 6Well, Ir seems safe for now. There's probably time to do a little scouting, right?
[10:45] <03Crion> 4These 'guards' probably aren't even people, properly speaking. She'll wander back to the town square and poke her head in the inn. Is anyone else around here playing music?
[10:45] <03Crion> 4Eikichi and his pain in the ass plans.
[10:57] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya will try seeking out a servant's entrance first - scaling the wall is appealing, but perhaps too flashy, and swimming is awful in the best of circumstances. He'll keep an ear out to hear if things go poorly with Ir, but come on, breaking into a castle.
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi and Blossom have crested a ridge such that they're right above a contingent of soldiers guarding the sorcerers at work. The sorcerers themselves appear to be mortals initiatied into the arts, and they're totally consumed with their magic - together, they're constantly gesturing and chanting to keep control and direction of a great auger of nearly-invisible earth essence that's 
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12lancing forward into the mine entrance and, presumably, extending downward into the mountains. Eikichi suspects that some complicated infrastructure involving mirrors and geomantic carvings is allowing the spell to thread its way far deeper than its casters could normally reach or see on their own.
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Right now, both Solars are hovering within a whirlwind, out of reach of the soldiers and elementals both. That's probably why the Cathak guardsmen are drawing bows.
03[11:18] * banan|peels is now known as banana
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir find a lot to potentially do at the town square. There's actually a little performer's stage, currently occupied by a band playing a catchy but repetitive tune that seems to be setting the tempo of all the other activities going on in the market square. There's a bar with room for a performer, plenty of spots she could just set up along the road to start busking... 'skald' is a 
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12biiit foreign to the daylit court, but 'bard' is definitely not.
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Tatsuya's at liberty to try to find a way into the castle that doesn't involve playing along - or, at least, involves playing along with a different set of players. Step one, case the place.
[11:22] <03Crion> 4She'll go busking, then. She's got a mistrust of these institutions. Doesn't want to be pressured into signing any contracts.
[11:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi holds his arms akimbo as if to sweep all the sorcerers into a big hug. "Do not despair, my friends! We come to dismantle the old order, not its prisoners. Imagine a world where we can practice our art without ostracism, a world where we needn't peddle our knowledge to soldiers and armies to prosper! In a more righteous world there is so much we can achieve together."
[11:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12The thief finds a number of avenues. First, there is some kind of submerged tunnel at the bottom of the moat, but using it would probably be uncomfortable for a number of reasons - holding your breath, cold water, all the giant alligators... beyond that, there's also a hedge maze of sorts on the opposite end of the castle from the main doors, so if you can get across the moat by 
[11:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12some means and navigate a complicated but ultimately solveable pattern of guard patrols you'll be able to just slip inside a back entrance.
[11:23] <03Crion> 4Ir runs through the classics on Iscariot as a six-string: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95WeNwF5448 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VydnNO2A0k4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_NHr4lvqc and so on.
[11:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This is the promise of the Unconquered Sun. It is the promise we stand and deliver. It is the promise of a better day."
[11:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Come! What say you?"
[11:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Finally, there's the church. It looks open to the public, and it's connected to the castle by a bridge, so if you can go in there and then lose whoever keeps an eye on visitors to stop them from just wandering off into the side halls you could probably climb to the main tower/steeple thing and then take the bridge across.
[11:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi speaks, and the four sorcerers share glances over the roiling tangle of earth essence they're carefully manipulating. To the layman, it doesn't appear they do anything further.
[11:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12The two solars know different, though, because they've got arcane training. They can see that two of the mages, both women, subtly unhook their hand gestures from the magic that's going on, ceasing their upkeep of the spell. A third, a man, is sweating - he keeps glancing up at the Stormwind Rider, clearly tempted, but ultimately grits his teeth and holds on. The fourth, another 
[11:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12woman, twists her face into a mask of fury and doesn't let up for a moment.
[11:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To the last, Eikichi says softly, "So be it." 10and begins to crush her will.
[11:31] <03trenchfoot> 6Well. If they're going to make it that simple, they deserve this.
[11:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir's skill is recognized almost immediately. It's not half an hour before a small crowd of elfin villagers and townsfolk is surrounding her play area and tapping their feet, dancing with each other, singing along, cheering her on... it's hard to tell which of these are basically constructs or hobgoblins and which are abducted people, but at least one listener must be a full-blown 
[11:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12raksha; she's a short-haired woman in a long furred coat who's demanded that her servants stop her carriage by the side of the road so that she can get a better listen.
[11:33] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya runs across the water and into the hedge maze. Crap moat you've got there.
[11:35] <03Crion> 4Ir ignores the rakhsa and goes about her set. She ignores the townsfolk too, for the most part; she's absorbed in her art.
[11:35] <03Crion> 4And she's letting the marks come to her.
[11:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's when Ir is between sets that a long-faced majordomo whose pointed ears and nose droop dramatically and eyes always seem to be closed approaches her. His lady has a proposition, he says; she'll be attending the court this very night, and her retinue is in need of a good musician if she's to impress.
[11:37] <03trenchfoot> 6And, once he's snuck through the hedge maze, it's a crap maze they have there too. He slips inside the castle without looking back.
[11:37] <03Crion> 4Ir accepts, but is careful to decline any compensation or offer of further employment.
[11:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12A hail of poorly-aimed boulders goes sailing past Eikichi and Blossom, missing by a damn mile. Following those boulders is what might be a full-on meteor, though; the sword-wielding Cathak dynast is blazing with flame as he takes a prodigious leap up the side of the very cliff that Eikichi and Blossom came drifting down from!
[11:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12A red jade daiklave, limned in flames, come swinging through the walls of the Stormwind Rider.
03[12:02] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[12:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12That was actually pretty had, Tatsuya finds, but not for the reasons infiltrations usually are. It's not that the guards were particualrly clever or observant, or the sight lines really punishing - there was just so much ground to cover, so many strictly consistent patterns of patrol to memorize and thread between. Still, he's done it - he's inside the castle itself, free to poke 
[12:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12around. What's Tatsuya want to do - rob the treasury, assassinate the king, graze off the kitchens...?
[12:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12Pretty hard*
[12:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12That's good practice on Ir's part, but largely unnecessary; any oaths sworn or agreements shaken on are really only going to be binding for the fae, especially given that the Dawn caste is proof against the Wyld's insidious influence.
[12:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Either way, though, her entrance to the castle is secured - although she'll probably have to wait for the evening to make it. The raksha noble Ir'll be playing for is named Rajiezna, and seems to be some kind of business mogul - she's got her hand in a wide variety of the item and potion and weapon and so on shops arrayed around the central square. Actually, she'd be delighted if Ir 
[12:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12could play around there for a while, or at least teach the noble's own bards a few good tunes, but it won't be a dealbreaker if Ir refuses.
[12:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12That aside, Ir's got some time to pass, which she could conceivably use on shopping or fine dining or just exploration of the rest of the freehold.
[12:06] <03Crion> 4Ir will indulge the raksha that much, as it'll get her more face time with the people she's supposed to be saving. But she's otherwise focused on getting into that castle and making a wager.
[12:08] <03trenchfoot> 6Well, Tatsuya meant to open a door for Ir, but she seems to have that covered. He'll have to content himself with looting, or sabotage - are there any instruments laying about?
[12:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Hmm, clever. Tatsuya roves the halls, searching for entertainers and their panoplies...
[12:12] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom raises her arms to the heavens. "Grinding forward bit by bit! Each turn re-creates the cycle of Essence! Heavenly purity coming to a single point... that's how a drill works!" 7By the gods, she's right! So right that the spell under the command of the other sorcerers bucks and twists out of their control, rampaging according to Blossom's will and severing key support beams 
[12:12] <03dammitwho> 7in the delving far below!
[12:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10*_*
[12:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12As she spends the day in fairyland, Ir becomes more and more conversant with the differences between the actual people and the nameless passers-by that seem to have been magicked into the streets and buildings for the sake of flavour and verisimilitude. There are tells - the people sweat and tire, the people use the washroom, the people sometimes look off into the distance or down 
[12:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12over the edge of the clouds wistfully. They don't SEEM particularly terrified or unhappy, for the most part, though a few are a bit crazy, or kind of fading mentally into the robotic simplicity of the conjured townsfolk.
[12:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12The good news is that there aren't that many abducted humans here - as large as the kingdom is, there are maybe twenty or thirty, all told, although there are probably more in the barracks, in the castle, and other parts of the daylit court Ir hasn't explored thoroughly.
[12:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Of these, perhaps the most arresting is a green-clad youth who comes striding into the shop of Rajiezna's armorer at the same time as Ir is giving the musician there (also a mortal) pointers as to how better to end the smithy's theme so that it loops nicely. His shield's broken from another trip down to the mortal world, apparently, and he needs it repaired before he can sally forth 
[12:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12again.
[12:21] <03Crion> 4Huh. Takes all kinds.
[12:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Down in the aforementioned mortal world, Blossom and Eikichi together seize the Pulverizing Auger and drag it wildly through the very mines it's built! The sorcerers gasp, and the young Cathak warrior roars with rage, as the very mountain you're standing on rumbles and buckles and even the mine's very entrance shears in half and collapse in on itself.
[12:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There uh... wasn't anyone inside, right? On account of the auger doing all the work.
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Not right then. It happens in shifts - the spell bores and bores and bores, and then teams of laborers go in to dig out the rubble and put in more support beams.

[12:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya hunts around. He creeps past patrolling guards, servants carrying big plates of food, doddering old priests whose robes drag on the hallways behind them. Eventually, though, he picks up on the sound of music, and that he's able to follow through the castle until he finds a broad atrium at the castle's west side. There, an entire orchestra plays, composed roughly half-and-half 
[12:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12of pointy eared humans (or humanoids, at least) and what seem to be motile plants of all shapes and sizes.
[12:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's no conductor that Tatsuya can immediately see, until he realizes that the curtains of leafy ivy hanging down across the pillars on the far, open-to-the-air side of the chamber are actually tresses of hair. There's a gigantic - like, ten or twelve feet tall - woman with green skin and foliage crawling 'cross her body who's sort of reclining along a high platform across the 
[12:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12room and sleepily watching the orchestra perform.
[12:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya can see a few fiddlers, including one which seems to be the star of the orchestra. It's, like... a sort of onion-shaped bulb with a leaf instead of a face, maybe half the size of a human or less? Really killing it, though.
[12:47] <03trenchfoot> 6Well. We'll just have to do something about that, then.
[12:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Ir's gotten the new customer's - really, the long-time repeat customer's - attention. The young man wanders over to her and the usual musician, shooting an inquisitive look and a questioning noise. "Ah, hey, lad. Just getting a few pointers." 12Does Ir want to explain herself?
[12:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12If it's Tatsuya's plan to sabotage the instruments or musicians themselves, one supposes he'll have to listen and wait.
[12:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Eikichi can't get loose - the dynast confronting him is leaving burning footprints in the air itself, dancing back and forth on the whirling grit and sand kicked up by and surrounding the Stormwind Rider spell. The elementals and guardsmen are taking aim once again, and the alarm's being raised, and the sorcerers are newly at odds with each other...
[12:50] <03Crion_> 4She'll continue speculatively tuning Iscariot. "You from around here, kid?"
[12:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh what is this nonsense now.
[12:52] <03@Ferrinus> "Mmm hmm," 12he nods, before peering closely at - the moonsilver fiddle Ir's been using by way of demonstration. There's something familiar about him...
[12:53] <03Crion_> 4Well, she's not about to hand it over for him to touch or anything.
[12:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12He doesn't reach for it or anything, but he does give it a hard stare. So focused is he on examining the thing, in fact, that he doesn't even appear to notice the golden sunburst that traces itself briefly on his forehead with the effort.
[12:56] <03Crion_> 4Ah, fuck.
[12:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12After a moment, the young man shrugs, turns, and heads off, apparently having other business in the freehold. Ir's left to either finish or abandon her lesson.
[12:57] <03Crion_> 4She'll finish the lesson.
[12:57] <03Crion_> 4And while she's teaching: "So, who's that kid?..."
[12:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12What will become of the split-up squared circle? We'll find out... next week.

[22:50] <03Crion> 4First, though, he'll shower, dress, feed the girls, feed himself from the supply in the blood fridge, and call the office to make sure there's nothing new that demands his attention. There probably isn't -- unless he has any text messages from Bryan or Brian -- but it's a good ritual and lets Buchanan and Rush know he's awake and ready for work.
[22:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson Frost is going to look at some flowers. He should bring Blythe a gift. What does she like?
01[22:51] <03banana> 6You could call amateur espionage and active engagement with policy institutions being a 'busybody', if you like.
[22:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hey, those are nice shoes. Custom-fitted?
01[22:51] <03banana> 6Comes from the same place as the gloves, yeah.
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ's dressing up tonight because she's going Out. The good kind of out, not the kind where you get attacked by huge fucking crow monsters.
[22:52] <03Crion> 4There's very little daylight between the two, to be honest, and not just because of the hours we keep.
[22:52] <03Quaker> There isn’t - although the fact that he only has to call Buchanan and Rush should give him pause, considering how much Donald Bren has been on his mind lately. Bren has more muscle and brains to call on than two office-dwelling ghouls. Santiago has been helpfully running errands for the barony since Cav got awarded it, but…maybe it’s time for him to start finding loyal retainers of his own. 
[22:54] <03Quaker> Blythe likes all sorts of things: offbeat foreign literature, High Art, medieval weaponry that’s very strictly not just for display, gardening equipment…
[22:54] <03Quaker> Surely KJ can delegate some of the tasks she has in mind to her network of contacts and small group of flunkies.
[22:56] <03tom> 14Tommy does what any sane person would when thrust into this awkward a situation; he leans back into the creaking antique furniture and, pretty much ignoring Sponger as much as one can, fucks around on his phone.
[22:56] <03Quaker> Meanwhile, Sponger hasn’t said anything since they got back to the basement. Soria isn’t in - he left a note, he’s staying for a few nights with a deacon down in Oceanside to help a new convert transition across the border with San Diego. 
[22:56] <03Crion> 4There are only a couple different ways to get retainers, most of them very morally compromised and the most straight-forward among them requiring some form of Court permission.
[22:56] <03tom> 14It's really for Sponger's benefit. Much more normal.
[22:56] <03Crion> 4...Actually, Cavanaugh isn't sure what the Court's rules on the Embrace are. They're probably stuffy, though, and besides, Cav doesn't want a childe.
[22:57] <03Quaker> It’s for the best that everyone continue to ignore any connections they might have to a bizarre and far-reaching occult conspiracy they might have stumbled upon in the canyon. 
[22:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10No more ghosts.
01[22:57] <03banana> 6Priority number 1: correspondence, get the night's reports, send out communications of various types. Letters, phone calls, visits, emails, PGP and OTP messaging, the dark web, dead drops. Couriered cards on silver platters. Who knew the Invictus were so chatty?
[22:58] <03Quaker> Anyone who has spent more than a few nights in Southern California. 
01[22:59] <03banana> 6Priority number 0 - KJ remembers nerds she's worked with, who aren't here to say 'heh'. Says it for them. Priority #0 is making sure this thing with Frances happens. She semi-literally Needs to go hit up the club and the clubbers.
[23:00] <03Quaker> Anyway, with Sponger secured, it looks like Tommy is out of a convenient, attention-consuming task! 
[23:00] <03tom> 14Shit!
[23:01] <03Crion> 4Cav's got a couple hours before the night really gets into full swing, so he heads back to his library, where last night's work didn't bear much fruit. He'll text KJ: <hey its cav. did we get anything else from the frank estate>
[23:01] <03Crion> <besides that poem>
[23:01] <03tom> 14Tommy does his best not to be a dick to the poor guy. You know, bring in his refrigerated blood packs, try to give the guy his privacy. But uh, you know, he tried to sneak away once already.
[23:01] <03tom> 14So there's that.
[23:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hmm. "NORAAA!"
[23:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nora's standing right next to him. "Yes?"
[23:06] <03tom> 14It's a real shame Soria isn't around. He was sorta hoping this would be his first real "in" to the church- to the real stuff, not just the street muscle jobs.
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Don't sneak up on me like that! Where's the halberd?"
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nora: "In the attic?"
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "No, the guisarme's in the attic."
[23:07] <03Quaker> Has Tommy considered merely being a good and faithful man...?
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nora: "I thought the guisarme was still in the truck."
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "No, I got the voulges in the truck."
[23:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nora: "Well I don't know then!"
[23:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ugh."
[23:08] <03Quaker> Well, Frances has triple-texted and e-mailed KJ the address for the new nightclub in Costa Mesa, so she won’t have any trouble finding it. 
01[23:08] <03banana> 6KJ's not stupid. She's worked out, in the few years she's been here, that most kindred don't have to feed quite so.. often. Like half as much, maybe, seems to be normal. And she's not in any real danger, anyway- Helena may be on the edge of cutting her loose but it turns out the Court supplies these rations to Barons and flunkies, like a kind of evil version of the Red Cross. But she still knows on some level deeper than intelligence that this is life or death.
[23:09] <03Quaker> Oh, so it’s EVIL that everyone has a reliable and trustworthy blood supply? Sure, okay-
[23:10] <03tom> [08:07] <Quaker> Has Tommy considered merely being a good and faithful man...?
[23:10] <03tom> 14Has he??
[23:10] <03Quaker> Has he? 
[23:10] <03tom> 14Tommy, apropos nothing: "Fuck."
[23:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10If it's not in the attic or the truck that means it's in the gallery. Nora's voice is gentle. "Do you want me to go-"
[23:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "No, no. Have Cora bring the car around."
01[23:13] <03banana> 6Kind of. I mean, someone had that blood before, right? And maybe they were using it. Whatever, for tonight's catch KJ is gonna wear.. black dress, something with one shoulder, earrings that catch (god forbid) disco lights.. she's got her hair back with a cute clip and the kind of makeup that makes idiots say "Oh, I love natural faces without all that product".
[23:14] <03Quaker> Sponger looks over. “What?” 
[23:14] <03tom> "Man."
[23:15] <03Quaker> The other Nosferatu waits for an elaboration, if one is forthcoming. 
01[23:15] <03banana> 6Probably best to drive herself. Not like she needs a DD anymore, and any parking tickets from the mess downtown will be an opportunity. She really needs to make some contacts in the Anaheim stations of LAPD.
01[23:15] <03banana> 6A text message? KJ will answer it on the way out. <Catalog: >
[23:16] <03tom> 14Tommy has his head in his hands. His phone is on the (also antique, dusty) bedside table, screen up. On it are Tommy's half-remembered and vague descriptions of the ritual that saved Sponger. "Why'd you join the church, Souza?"
01[23:17] <03banana> <🕐 Impending sense of doom.>

[23:18] <03Quaker> Sponger, after thinking and without much irony: “I felt grateful. Not for…the people in it. For the other thing.” 
01[23:19] <03banana> 6KJ: <Tommy 🤐 found it in the catacombs. It's a big grid of numbers which looked like ciphered blocks but has literal 0 entropy.>
01[23:21] <03banana> 6KJ: <🔢 ➡ 🔠>
01[23:22] <03banana> 6This guy is so slow. Is he, like, picking out the letters with one finger? Costa Mesa here we come.
[23:22] <03tom> "Other thing?"
[23:23] <03Quaker> Frances is waiting by the entrance, next to a disinterested and quite unoccupied bouncer. There doesn’t seem to be anyone in line…
[23:23] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Salvation. Love.” 
[23:25] <03Crion> 4Cav was distracted by an extremely large cat, and then by actually starting to solve the cipher without responding. <cool thx. i think this will do it>
[23:25] <03Crion> <will report back. ltr>
01[23:27] <03banana> 6KJ: <Will do what??> 6Wow. She holds up the phone as she approaches Frances and her probably-dead club. "They always bail on you when they've got what they want."
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson goes to the gallery alone. He keeps it locked, partly so the expensive climate control system isn't working overtime. It's cool and dry, with tiled floors. Soft lighting comes to life automatically when he crosses the threshold. Easy to imagine a hushed tour guide. But nothing's under glass, not the books or the statues or the weapons. The weapons, in particular, are on sturdy 
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10mounts and maintained well enough to be carried directly from the gallery into battle. He grabs a polearm, five hundred years old, Swiss, and it's gone.
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Two faces look down at him.
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10One is his: http://i.imgur.com/DDwqLvCl.jpg
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The other is not: http://i.imgur.com/bHIFwi2l.jpg
[23:27] <03tom> 14Tommy slouches, back of his head against the wall. He checks the time. "It's a much better pitch, you know- it's like..."
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's only when the lights turn off because they haven't detected any movement that Wilson's startled into leaving.
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Lancaster, then.
[23:28] <03Quaker> It’s barely 8:00. The night has just begun. Sponger sits up. “Better than what?” 
[23:29] <03tom> "Well it's just like- you know, everyone else is just some pitch of, 'everything's fucked, but, great, you're one of the Fuck-ers now, 'stead of the fuck-ees."
[23:29] <03tom> "Some shade of that crap."
[23:30] <03tom> "Even the spears, the mainstream stuff."
[23:32] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Everyone else tells you that you can give up your responsibility.” 
[23:33] <03tom> 14He perks up. "Huh."
[23:34] <03Quaker> Frances is dressed in a sensible black, er, dress. “Oh, uh,” she says, looking around. “I’m sure people will start to show up soon.” She brightens. “But you’re here! That’s good enough for now. Let’s go inside! I directed the remodeling myself.” 
[23:35] <03tom> 14He picks his arm up off the nightstand and brushes the dust off. God, how depressing to be stuck down here.
[23:35] <03tom> "See- I sorta felt the other way around, s'weird." 14He spins his finger atop an invisible turnstyle.
[23:36] <03tom> "Like.. oh good, here are some people that won't make me kneecap a guy. Time to turn my brain off, finally."
01[23:37] <03banana> 6KJ: Cristo redento. This is why we're archnemeses. "Yeah, ok! Does that mean we shouldn't paint the town red? Or is that gonna add to the effect you were going for.."
[23:38] <03tom> "Stupid thought, I know. That's not why we're doing this."
[23:38] <03Quaker> The great Lancaster estate looms vertically out of the flat, cold sand and dirt of the desert and scrublands of the lands beyond the mountains. The cold white light of fluorescents illuminate the front entrance, with its pillars and hedges. Three servants will be waiting by the door, one to attend to his Hollywood counterparts, one to take anything heavy off of Wilson’s hands, and the other to greet him effusively. “Baron Hollywood. It is 
[23:38] <03Quaker> an honor, sir, as always. The Countess awaits you inside.” 
[23:39] <03tom> "But I mean, that's how they get you." 14He nods. "That's how they fucking get you. You know, you get a chunk and you just gotta maintain it, keep your head down and follow the rules, let the bad shit slide because, hey, not your problem, right?"
[23:39] <03tom> 14He fans his hands. "Then, Boom, next thing you know you're cutting fucking throats with the best of them."
[23:40] <03Quaker> Sponger: “I mean….you’re kind of abandoning yourself. Inhabiting a role. Giving up your duty to be yourself, when you can just wear a mask.” 
[23:40] <03tom> "What if myself is a huge fucking asshole?"
[23:41] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Then you’re responsible for changing.” 
[23:41] <03tom> 14He makes a pained grunt.

[23:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson walks like he's encumbered, but then doesn't he always? The servant can take his coat and then Wilson goes inside.
03[23:42] * Joins: trenchfoot (ian@sorcery-ave6tm.in.comcast.net)
[23:42] <03Crion> 4Cav sets the phone aside after his last text for a good hour or two. It's time to work -- very, very methodically, while writing everything down.
[23:44] <03Quaker> Frances looks around the interior of the beautifully renovated nightclub for an answer. “Um…there’s a few people in the corner…that’s pretty much it. You’re welcome to them…” There are, it seems, about half a dozen people nervously trying to make conversation with each other, a bartender with nothing to do, and two figures talking to each other in a back circular booth. The nightclub really is beautiful, though! Soft golden 
[23:44] <03Quaker> light, with just a hint of smoky darkness, walls tiled with a soft ceramic look, fountains and white linen hangings completing the look of some relaxed public bath. 
01[23:45] <03banana> 6Hopeless. Like a baby bird with a broken wing. Okay. "Yeah I think in a bit. But, and let's talk out on the dance floor in the hope it gives people ideas.."
01[23:46] <03banana> "Yuan. Frances. Baron The Cool Parts Of Disneyland. Did you advertise at all?"
[23:47] <03tom> 14He sniffs. "But uh.. the reason I asked y'know about-" 14he waves, vaguely. "I'm a Deacon, a position I take, well, you know- about as seriously as I take anything."
02[23:47] * Quits: trenchfoot (ian@sorcery-ave6tm.in.comcast.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:47] <03Quaker> Blythe Sulzberger, Countess Lancaster, descends down the grand staircase to meet him. She’s wearing the same outfit she wore to the opera, minus the hat. “Wilson. I hope your trip here was uneventful.” All around, landscape paintings showing the poppy fields in full summer bloom light up the room with oranges and reds. 
03[23:48] * Joins: trenchfoot (ian@sorcery-ave6tm.in.comcast.net)
[23:48] <03Quaker> Frances looks certain. “Yes, of course! I put advertisements in all the major newspapers. Even the Pennysaver.” 
[23:49] <03tom> "But my job is sorta ill-defined. I have the run of the Parish, but no real paper obligations."
[23:49] <03tom> "You been here longer than I have."
01[23:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "I don't know if anybody.. reads newspapers? Like of course they did, fifty years ago."
[23:50] <03tom> "So I guess I'm asking for... advice?"
01[23:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "The club scene is like.. this is not my area of expertise and APPARENTLY it is yours, actually, but, I was thinking torn ads for popular local bands plastered on every street corner and public toilet?"
[23:51] <03Quaker> Frances: “I’m not an idiot, KJ. I did the whole online thing, too. Myspace. Craigslist. All the big ones.” 
01[23:51] <03banana> "It's possible somebody is hexing you and hexing your club."
01[23:53] <03banana> "Honestly, if you need to hunt them down and kill them I'm in."
[23:54] <03Quaker> Cav’s transcriptions require effort and attention, but with the code, he makes constant progress. 
[23:55] <03Crion> 4He takes a short break, during which he wonders if he shouldn't set up a ceiling-mounted webcam pointing down at the table, so he can have recordings of the entire process.
[23:55] <03Quaker> They seem to be…a collection of different things, actually. Short quotations from larger works, interspersed with diary-like entries, starting from 1972 and heading back in time. 
[23:55] <03Crion> 4Not only would that help with the whole memory thing, but his new 'colleagues' might find it interesting as well. Or maybe not. Who knows.
[23:57] <03Quaker> So things like “You can tell the state of dispassion has been reached when the spiritual intellect starts to catch glimpses of its own inner radiance, when it can remain in a state of tranquility even when troubled by dream images, and when it can look on all of life’s affairs with equanimity,” are mixed in with mundane reports of politicking in the Orange Court, describing the petty feuds of different nobles Cav has either never heard o
[23:57] <03Quaker> or whose names are disguised with simple assigned letters. 
[23:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's wearing a light suit of pale brown linen, the sort of thing you might wear if you were going to look at a garden outdoors in summer. "Blythe! You look lovely. I brought you something." 10He presents the halberd to her with a flourish as from midair.
[23:57] <03tom> 14He puts his palms up at Sponger. "I mean, like. You beat the shit outta Cosmo Morgan, one of the worst ratfuckers out there. So you're at least doing something right."
[23:58] <03Crion> 4He wonders briefly if this stuff might be dangerous to even read. Cav remembers that Rollie's condition spread memetically. At least after a fashion.
[23:58] <03Quaker> Frances looks less certain as she does her best to dance. It looks like she hasn’t learned any moves since the midcentury. “Well…we’re technically in Donald Bren’s territory. I just bought the feeding rights to the club itself. So you probably…shouldn’t.”

Session Time: Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03Quaker> Lancaster examines it with interest. “Oh, this really is genuine.” She looks at the armorer’s stamp. “You shouldn’t have. I only wanted to catch up with you.” She looks around. “I’ll have one of the paintings wrapped for you. Take it home with you.” 
[00:00] <03Quaker> Sponger shakes his head. “I don’t think awaiting a death sentence in a basement is because I did something right. By anyone’s law.” 
[00:01] <03tom> 14He scoffs. "You aren't gonna die, Souza."
[00:01] <03tom> "Cav seems pretty sure we can throw this out."
[00:02] <03Quaker> Here’s something interesting, if mildly alarming. The diary mentions repeated visits to…”the forests, beyond the lights.” 
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4Ah, more dark forests. Baron Anaheim will be pleased.
01[00:02] <03banana> 6KJ: "OK no I definitely shouldn't. Honestly, the club is beautiful and I don't know why people haven't caught on yet." 
01[00:03] <03banana> "There's a kind of greco-roman vibe, which might not be what the kids are into these days? My only real idea is, get in a band, something with lyrics you could misrepresent as 'let's all get drunk and make out'."
[00:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You're too kind. How've you been, Blythe?"
[00:04] <03Quaker> Sponger: “One Invictus noble tempts me into this situation, the other promises to get me out. I’d rather have avoided them altogether.” 
01[00:04] <03banana> 6Someday she's got to actually find out how old Frances is. Somenight.
02[00:06] * Quits: Crion_ (Crion@sorcery-00t34t.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
01[00:07] <03banana> 6KJ's actually torn between probing into what the heck Frances is doing with a club and.. taking advantage of the fact she's got one. Just a few people here makes it dangerous.. but that's fine.
[00:08] <03Quaker> One of the figures in the back booth has tilted the massive oak table up so it’s sloping. “See, no gum. I told you it was brand new. Yuan wouldn’t buy used, god-“ “Don’t, you’re gonna push it over,” “No, look, I can hold it. Golf is a workout, right? Technically I’ve been working out.” “You ride around in the cart.” “Hey, look at the grain on the underside-“ “Jesse, you’re gonna get us thrown out-“ The table
[00:08] <03Quaker> crashes on its side with a bang. 
[00:08] <03Crion> 4Anyway, Cav will carefully transcribe all the information to his phone, which he's got linked to the office's CMS remotely -- he publishes the text, and then careful photographs of the pages and the cipher itself to a secured folder in the cloud, then deletes the local copies.
[00:11] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Busy. The Court has need of a strongman who’s less self-interested than my sire and with fewer strings attached than the Marquise. Of course,” she says, smiling, “I’m less sociable than either.”
[00:11] <03Quaker> Frances ignores it. “So, um…are you impressed?” 
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What kind of work they got you doing?"
[00:12] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Keeping tabs on bits and bobs and figures of interest. Like you. I’m acquiring quite the stable of interesting associates.” 
[00:13] <03Quaker> “The rest, of course, I’m not at liberty to discuss. What’s the line? If I told you, I’d have to kill you,” she jokes. Wilson thinks. She’s not very good at it. 
[00:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Not necessarily a dealbreaker."
[00:16] <03Quaker> She guides him out into the gardens, towards the greenhouses. “Maybe I’m picking up the attitude from my new rival in Palos Verdes. You know how that crowd is.” She pauses. “Well, maybe you don’t. Lucky you.” 
[00:17] <03Crion> 4Cav has the rest of the night to himself, then. He'll get caught up on any paperwork he's neglected. Taxes, for one. The legal person he once was still has to pay them on his investments.
01[00:18] <03banana> 6Thaaaat seems like something Frances might want to deal with? No? Well, you can't call her a control freak. 
[00:19] <03Quaker> There’s a difference between translating and reading. Cav can get as far as a fifth into the diary before his cipher abruptly stops working, around 1971. Actually, this diary seems to jump around in time quite a bit. Maybe its sorted by theme rather than date? The last entry reads: 
01[00:20] <03banana> 6Anyway, KJ is impressed, just not.. pleased. She can channel that. "It's way beyond what I'd expected. The ambition and effort it takes to move into this business is a big deal! They always say it's a close-knit thing- I guess you'll end up hanging out with other local nightlife types as things pick up, forming photo ID cartels or whatever."
01[00:21] <03banana> "How are you doing on smoky backrooms and fizzy drinks and stuff?"
[00:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Murray?"
01[00:23] <03banana> 6She's also keeping an eye on the, uh, 'crowd'. Are there any prospects there at all? Any frustrated young men, maybe ones wondering if they've walked into the wrong club.. or the cocky types who're playing at being big fish in a new and oddly well-lit pond?
[00:24] <03Quaker> Transcribed from the Temple of Pisha-Kunak-Ter, recovered 1941, fragments.
[00:24] <03Quaker> “...As he himself said, it is that very Kingdom that comes in power to those who have seen It. On that day those with sight will shine with radiance and glory, they will be made scintillatingly bright in the internal void by receiving that light as It gives it to them. For [...] which in the present life we come to the altar to receive [...] 
[00:24] <03Quaker> that one day will be revealed to the eyes of all coming upon the clouds [...] In one instant it will display its brilliance to the east and the west like a lightning flash, showing what has been perfected within [...] we contemplate our change [...]” 
[00:27] <03Crion> 4It.
[00:27] <03Crion> 4That's auspicious.
[00:30] <03Quaker> Franks’s voice resumes after that. “I have entrusted the eldest of the three siblings with my notes and my updated codes, although even she only knows the locations of the latter, not their contents. I’m grateful for her…and I pity her. One sister mad, one brother bad, and she has to shepard her lonely little tribe through the place no light reaches, wondering if it would be easier to examine her heritage more closely…I must remember
[00:30] <03Quaker> to bring her a gift next time. Los Padres is not a place where luxuries are found, but it is a place where they are appreciated.” 
[00:31] <03Quaker> The rest of the entry ends with little of interest, just a few random notes and scribblings, impossible to make sense of without context. 
[00:33] <03Quaker> Frances looks incredibly relieved and happy at securing KJ’s qualified approval. “Oh…I don’t have any smoky backrooms. Just…the dance floor. I mean, it was supposed to be louder in here…I mean, it will be, once more people show up. So you don’t have to worry about being overheard.” Some people have walked in, actually, the local Costa Mesa blend of people dressed up from their work in Irvine law firms and people dressed down 
[00:33] <03Quaker> from some warehouse crew nearby. She has her pick of young workers. 
[00:35] <03Crion> 4Eldest of three siblings. Two sisters and a brother. The younger sister insane, the younger brother evil (from Franks' perspective, at least).
01[00:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "Guess we better not hold the new barons' club here then, which is a shame - the tile is so lovely, un-beer-stained as it yet is."
[00:35] <03Crion> 4That should give him some place to start. There's already one old coot vampire out there who might be involved. The nursing home lady. The hell was her name?
[00:37] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “You know. The whole coast crowd. They don’t like their toes being stepped on, figure any questions of security should run through them. Of course, Bailey doesn’t…” She cups a flower in her hand, her attention directed at its petals for a moment. “Hm. Fertilizer isn’t taking with this bunch. Baily doesn’t want them to think they have a monopoly on it. Of course, it’s too late for that…” 
[00:38] <03Quaker> Frances: “Well…we already have four here, tonight. It’s kind of a barons’ club already. Or at least a club with barons in it.” 
01[00:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "What do you think of the kid over there? The blond, looks like he works out between sales leads and commenting on the Onion A/V Review."
[00:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You'd think security people would be less insecure."
[00:39] <03Quaker> Frances: “He’s no match for you.” 
[00:40] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Not when it’s been their ticket to a better life. Then their reaction makes perfect sense.” She stops in front of a perfectly formed poppy, plucks it off the plant, and puts it in his coat pocket. “Are you feeling better?” 
[00:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm having a nice time." 10That's not exactly an answer, but it isn't a lie either.
[00:42] <03Quaker> Under her breath, Yuan mutters. “….no one is…” 
01[00:42] <03banana> 6KJ: "None of them are. It's 6so good to teach them that.. hey, would you mind saying hi to Jesse and Pearl for me? I might be a while. I'll send the three of you this cool video I took, no CGI involved.."
[00:43] <03Quaker> Frances: “Sure, yeah. I’ll leave you alone. Have fun.” 
[00:44] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “I just meant…generally. I know that I lift everyone’s spirits when I’m in their presence, obviously.” 
[00:44] <03Crion> 4Anyway, there's another problem to tackle before that -- the question of what familial ties Franks even means. Actual siblings by birth, or childer of the same sire?
01[00:44] <03banana> "Frances?" 6KJ's got her phone out for a sec, swiping through it to pass on the video of the thing in the woods. It'll either give them a kick or get her some useful info. 
[00:44] <03Crion> 4And, of course, whether 'shepherd' there is incidental, or...
[00:44] <03Quaker> Frances: “Yes?” 
[00:45] <03Crion> 4Probably not incidental, to be honest. Franks knew Alicia, and Alicia had business in Los Angeles that she's yet to divulge to Cav. But attacking that obstacle head-on was likely to get him nowhere except compromised.
[00:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson fiddles with the poppy. "I don't know. I've been getting out more. If I had a therapist they'd probably say I was making progress."
[00:45] <03Quaker> Something pings on Cav’s phone. It’s a little used email account. Official Crook & Cross business. 
01[00:46] <03banana> "Thank you for showing me this place, and opening it up for us. It's really great to be adding something positive to the world." 6KJ's got a broad smile and, of course, the blood discipline of Majesty. Her eyes are already on the boy with an attitude and no dance partner.
[00:46] <03Crion> 4Great.
[00:47] <03Crion> 4It probably has read receipts enabled, too, so might as well open it.
[00:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "But I go out, and mostly I just see other unhappy people. Makes me wonder why everyone says getting out more is supposed to make you feel better."
[00:48] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “I think the phrase is, ‘the first step is admitting you have a problem.’” She pauses. “Unhappy people can take solace in each other, though. I suppose that’s a mercy.” 
[00:48] <03Quaker> >>URGENT<<
[00:48] <03Quaker> To All Associates & Partners,
[00:54] <03Quaker> It is with solemnity and unhappiness that I must inform the firm that Cornelius van Vleick and Markus Holmgren, two of our Directors, have been officially designated as missing following the sinking of their transport to Europe in a sudden storm. All of the firm’s eastern seaboard resources will be immediately redirected towards the search for our honored elders, which I will be personally leading. To assist with the firm’s daily 
[00:54] <03Quaker> operations, I am assigning my childe Alicia Holymount the interim title of Director. Your patience and hard work are appreciated more now than ever. Please direct any questions to….[etc]. 
[00:54] <03Quaker> , Peter Holymount. 
[00:55] <03Crion> 4Oh shit.
[00:55] <03Crion> 4The old bastard finally went and did it.
[00:56] <03Crion> 4He'll put down the phone, pace a bit, stare at it, then pick it up and text the contact in his phone as A. Holymount a single word: <Congratulations.>
[00:56] <03Crion> 4Then he'll turn the damn thing off for awhile.
[00:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It can be hard to tell when unhappy people are taking solace in each other and when they're just making each other worse. Feeding off each other."
[00:57] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “I suppose you can approach it with discipline. Ruthlessly. ‘Are you making me happier?’ ‘Am I being my best self around you?’ Cut them out if the answer is no.” 
[00:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Doesn't really seem like a way to treat people, though, does it?"
[00:59] <03Crion> 4He'll take a walk, spend thirty minutes or so wandering the night streets of Laguna, before he turns his phone back on.
[01:01] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “It depends on the people. Whether they’re really your friends, or whether you only know them because of circumstance and proximity. Allthough, they might do a version of the same to you regardless of how you treat them. Might as well protect yourself.” 
[01:02] <03Quaker> In the chat app, Cav has a single response. 
[01:02] <03Quaker> <Thank you.> 
[01:02] <03Crion> 4That's that, then.
[01:02] <03Quaker> He sees the chat bubble of a response being typed appear for a few seconds. It goes away, and doesn’t come back. 
[01:03] <03Crion> 4He sits down and sighs and stares out at the water.
[01:03] <03Crion> 4It's to be a coup, then.
[01:03] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “So, what now?” 
01[01:04] <03banana> 6All the others are jealous. It's her they watch and him she wants, he who's entitled by his hair and his suit and his words and his job. Her voice is the same as her body, amazing without being able to remember a damn thing about it. Everyone's still watching him and her both on the way out (No back rooms but there isn't a nightclub in existence without a back alley. Maybe he won't even wait to take her home. Pretty sure he can show her a thing or two right here. (She's got something to show him too. It's a stained knife, and what's one more-))
[01:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "For who?"
[01:09] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “You.” 
[01:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson shrugs. "I guess you've still got me keeping tabs on Cavanaugh. Though honestly I think that's a little alarmist."
03[01:12] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[01:15] <03Crion> 4He stands and walks back towards the house. The first thing he needs to do is limit his liability. And that means being informed about what the hell the Shepherds want from Los Angeles. When did Kevin MacMahon leave the city?
01[01:15] <03banana> 6KJ steps out of the smoky light of the half-empty club to the "club of barons'" table. Hopefully it's upright by now. 
[01:16] <03Quaker> It isn’t, it’s got a crack down the middle and another has been dragged into its place while it rests stricken close by. 
[01:18] <03Quaker> About a month after Cav’s promotion to Baron. 
01[01:18] <03banana> 6Well. Having the other one giving them a little privacy might be good; the way KJ looks right now, crossing the floor visibly would have attracted attention. Suffused with the blush of life, of course, but also literally blushing and very obviously satisfied. She's not radiating any actual vampire magic anymore, though!
[01:20] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Is it? Murray wanted to assign a babysitter of her own. I figured I should push that we do the same.” 
[01:21] <03Crion> 4And Cav's sure he did, in fact, leave the city? They saw each other before he went and he said he was going? He didn't up and vanish one night, then send a text message or e-mail later apologizing for jetting off?
[01:22] <03Quaker> He stopped by a for a few minutes’ awkward conversation, in person. He didn’t elaborate on his reasons for leaving, though he hinted that Cav’s newfound favor with the court meant that the Shepards’ interests were obviously being well enough represented in Southern California. 
[01:22] <03Crion> 4Well, that's good.
[01:23] <03Crion> 4A new director means an organizational reshuffle. He might not be alone out here for much longer.
[01:24] <03Quaker> Frances is listening to Jesse talk about some kind of reality show with rapt attention. Pearl is staring off at nothing in particular. “So then Marci wins the immunity challenge. But she’s still pissed off at James for kissing Kaytie a couple nights ago, right. So she makes him go to the house vote-“ 
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hollywood: "If she was here I'd tell her she was being alarmist, too. Do you think he'd be worth keeping tabs on if Helena wasn't?"
[01:26] <03Crion> 4What he needs to do is to start consolidating his friends in LA. Not an easy task, considering how they've all fled the city and left him here.
01[01:27] <03banana> 6KJ: "These things are practically Mafia now. Gimme Say Yes to the Dress anyday."
[01:27] <03Crion> 4But maybe there's some promise to be found in these new barons.
[01:28] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Well…I don’t really know his sire. Or hers. Don’t you think it’s a bit worrisome, involving these…outside people?” She stops, suddenly. “Can you keep a secret?” 
[01:29] <03Quaker> Jesse: “What have you been up to, KJ? Still running errands for the Silent One?” 
[01:30] <03Crion> 4At the very least, this Baron Anaheim seems good at computers. Could be a useful contact to have if any of Peter's whizkid ghouls start poking around his network.
[01:31] <03Crion> 4In fact, up-armoring the barony network has gone to the top of the priority list. Especially given what he's got on their servers.
01[01:31] <03banana> 6KJ: "Nah, that's ending. I've got to learn how to actually, like, look after a territory in a way which doesn't involve being at war. What did James see in Kaytie?"
[01:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sure."
[01:33] <03Quaker> Jesse shrugs. “Who knows. It’s all edited, anyway. What’s this about a New Barons club?” 
[01:33] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “A little birdie told me that they’re not so outside as they’d like us to think.” 
[01:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What for? They looking to expand?"
[01:35] <03Crion> 4Hollywood probably isn't interested or involved enough in Court politics to be compromised, either -- except by young women with similar-sounding names, Cav recalls; might want to make sure he's not one of those Kindred before investing too heavily in any relationship there -- and that Carmelite cleric with the fucking dragonsbreath shotgun taped to his back would be good when this 
[01:35] <03Crion> 4whole thing blows up.
[01:36] <03Crion> 4And they're all still tied together by what happened at the Franks Estate. Where he saw a ghost of Alicia.
[01:36] <03Crion> 4Too many coincidences.
[01:36] <03Crion> 4Starting to get that creeping feeling again, the one Cav remembers so well from his time as deputy: everyone knows what's going on but you.
01[01:38] <03banana> 6This is.. good. Comfortable, feeling human-or-better.. amid Jesse's inane dramas and Pearl's companionable glowering and Frances' approval-seeking thing (always manages to succeed in the end, somehow). KJ's putting off going back to work as long as she feels she can.
01[01:38] <03banana> "Do you think it's a good idea? I'd like to make a secret society or bookclub out of people under some threshhold. Maybe 'ennobled after the war', or 'born after the WORLD wars', like.. something to symbolise being a group of go-getters and shit-kickers who know what being on fleek means and won't take the status quo for an answer."
[01:40] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “I think they meant that the Shepherds have been involved in things here for more than just a few months. Which makes the fact that we’ve only recently heard of them a bit strange, don’t you think?” 
[01:41] <03Quaker> Jesse: “But…I was born before the war.” 
[01:41] <03Quaker> Pearl:  “But you were ennobled afterward.” 
01[01:41] <03banana> 6KJ: "Really? What did gramophones sound like?"
01[01:41] <03banana> 6KJ: "Really? What did gramophones sound like?"
[01:42] <03Quaker> Jesse: “Oh, right. Well, as long as I can be in it, I think you should do it. They sounded scratchy.” 
[01:42] <03Quaker> Pearl: “What’s on fleek mean?” 
[01:43] <03Quaker> Frances: “But…the status quo, kind of, um…didn’t it give us all baronies?” 
[01:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Maybe so. But I was never really in with the crowd who kept that kind of secret. I guess I seem untrustworthy."
[01:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Which is a little ironic, since if I was more trusted I'd probably have been executed as a spy."
01[01:44] <03banana> 6KJ: "I honestly have no idea what it means. Maybe with enough young people we could find out."
[01:45] <03Quaker> Frances: “How young is ‘young?’” 
01[01:46] <03banana> 6KJ: "I feel like we're straying close to incredibly dangerous questions."
01[01:46] <03banana> "Maybe better revise it to, people who can't be described by the word 'fogey'?"
[01:47] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “…I became tired of being someone else’s pawn.” 
[01:49] <03Quaker> Jesse: “Just make sure they’re the right kind of people. They have to have dignity. Hey, did you hear that thing about Cosmo Morgan getting almost killed by one of the Carmelites?” 
[01:49] <03Quaker> Frances: “I heard it was half a dozen. They jumped him.” 
[01:50] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “That’s my excuse for dipping my toes in, I suppose. I apologize if I’m assuming an enthusiasm for this in you.” 
01[01:50] <03banana> 6Okay, it's kind of weird when the cool young people are all fifty years older than you. KJ has a fleeting image of how Helena Murray saw her - some sort of literal baby animal, one of those horrible naked rats, squeaking about advancement and respect. 
01[01:51] <03banana> 6But she likes these women. Changing the world doesn't have to mean making everyone change, right? Just the ones on the wrong side of progress.
[01:51] <03Crion> 4It's better if you're improbably arrogant while not thinking about that.
[01:51] <03Crion> 4At least that's what Cav's found.
01[01:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "How close did they get to getting him?"
01[01:52] <03banana> "Did they at least keep him from talking for a few months?"
[01:52] <03Quaker> Frances: “I heard he had to run for it. He escaped by tricking them, or something.” 
[01:53] <03Quaker> Pearl, with a sudden vehemence. “They should have killed him. Not just him, Bren too.” 
[01:53] <03Quaker> Frances looks around, uncomfortable. “Um…he did let me have this place, so…” 
01[01:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "Did he.. make you pay much?"
[01:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's fine. It's nice to be of use to somebody. I forgot what that felt like."
[01:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What do you think I should do next?"
[01:55] <03Quaker> Jesse: “*My* mother always said he couldn’t be trusted. Bren, I mean. Any of his children. I heard his bloodline is….actually, I forget. Something bad.” 
[01:56] <03Quaker> Frances: “Oh, well…I mean, he gave me a loan. I didn’t exactly have the money on me, per se.” 
01[01:56] <03banana> 6Oh god.
[01:57] <03Quaker> Frances: “What?” 
[01:59] <03Quaker> Jesse: “Didn’t it happen in Laguna Beach? Ugh, poor Baron Laguna. He has to deal with all that legal stuff. It’s so *boring*.” 
01[02:00] <03banana> 6KJ's mood isn't entirely gone. It'd take more than just one piece of bad news to make this a bad night. But she's hunched down a little and she's unconsciously calling upon the shadows, making their booth just a tiny bit harder to notice, harder for the world to get in. 
01[02:01] <03banana> "That's kind of dangerous, Frances, because it means business has to pick up faster. Will he be ok with it if you.. manage to pay him back earlier?"
[02:02] <03Quaker> Frances: “I mean…it’s…um. We kind of agreed on a set payment plan. Plus he gave me a really good interest rate. 35%.” 
01[02:03] <03banana> "Oh for fuck's sake."
[02:03] <03Quaker> Pearl: “That’s not a good interest rate.” 
01[02:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "Ok, you're having me on. This is like something out of a Christmas morality play. Nobody really thinks 35% is a good interest rate, and actually you've got no money problems, right? You got us."
01[02:04] <03banana> "I admit I was like, really really worried for a moment."
[02:05] <03Quaker> Countess Lancaster: “Give it some thought.” 
[02:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Give what some thought?"
[02:07] <03Quaker> Blythe gestures to the rows upon rows of brightly colored flowers growing in black soil. “About what your interests are. What you have a stake in defending.” 
[02:07] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Nothing was as freeing as the moment I began to act for myself.” 
[02:08] <03Quaker> “And began to realize that all the nightmares of my past didn’t have to direct my course.” 
[02:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You've got to want something to act for yourself."
[02:09] <03Quaker> Frances: “Um…but, I mean…that’s a good deal, right? If I don’t have that much money, but I’m the one who ends up with a club anyway…” 
[02:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't really..." 10he shrugs. "What am I supposed to want?"
01[02:11] <03banana> 6God damn it. That's why he didn't mind the feeding rights- he'll get them back soon enough! 
[02:13] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “To reshape the world to be as you like it.” Her hand caresses the leaves of an orchid. “To leave for the desert, to arrive in a hostile void, to turn it into your garden, where no one dares to…” Her other hand begins to curl. “To wrest respect from hate and fear.” 
01[02:13] <03banana> "No. No, it's an awful deal intended to ensnare you. It'd be flat out illegal in Kine law. Do you want to know the details, if that matters?" 6I'm so sorry. We have to fix this.
01[02:14] <03banana> 6'We'. But if KJ does anything of the sort she goes in the memory hole!
[02:14] <03Quaker> Frances, taken by surprise, seizes up. “Uh….uh…what do you…um…ensnare me?” 
[02:15] <03Quaker> Cav’s phone rings. 
[02:15] <03Crion> 4Caller ID...?
[02:16] <03Quaker> It’s Rush. “Hi, Mr. Cavanaugh. There’s a visitor for you at the office.” 
[02:16] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Who is it?"
01[02:16] <03banana> 6Pearl's reaction is sane - Pearl usually is - but what does Jesse think of all this? "Loans are capital, being invested for a return.. you put the money to work. But most businesses don't grow fast. 35% in a year for a single club is impossible."
01[02:17] <03banana> "And the only way you'd be making payments is if you grew revenue faster than the debt itself. Lord Bren knows that. Lord Bren doesn't think you can do it. He expects you to end up owing him more than you can repay. Soon. A lot more."
[02:17] <03Quaker> “Um…Donald Bren. Buchanan is taking him to the conference room. I excused myself and called you.” 
[02:18] <03Crion> 4Fuck.
[02:18] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'll be right in."
[02:18] <03Crion> 4Well. This was bound to happen eventually.
01[02:18] <03banana> "We- we have to fix this." 6No no no no no. But but but but but.
[02:18] <03Quaker> Jesse: “Just have your parents manage your wealth. It’s what I do.” 
[02:19] <03Crion> 4He'll send out a group text to Anaheim, Hollywood, and the Deacon. <bren just dropped by my office. for a meeting. going over there now.>
[02:19] <03Crion> <not sure why>
[02:19] <03Crion> <everyone stay frosty>
[02:19] <03Quaker> Frances: “But…oh…um…” Her hands are shaking. “I should…call my sire…” 
01[02:19] <03banana> 6Fucking 'landowners'. Is that what Okienka is defending herself against - people like Donald Bren? "That would be a really good idea."
[02:21] <03Crion> 4Then he's back in his best, crispest suit, in his car, and heading to Orange Standards & Compliance. He decided to keep the name after all.
01[02:21] <03banana> "This could be- there are ways to resolving this. It might be a political thing rather than a money thing at all. If you need any help- but yeah you should call.." 6c h r i s t.
[02:22] <03Quaker> Frances: “But then…if…oh no…” She puts her head in her hands. “He wanted leverage over Sherman. I’m such an IDIOT-“ 
01[02:23] <03banana> 6Did Yuan ever meet Bren? Would she have taken money from him if he'd *been* there, like he is, making you feel helpless like KJ still feels even at this remove?
[02:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's phone buzzes in his pocket, but now doesn't seem the time. "I came out here to make a fortune. I came out here because I wanted people to love me. Then I did. Now..."
[02:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I've never thought of myself as being haunted by the past."
[02:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's the future I can't deal with."
[02:26] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “It’s the only thing we truly possess.” 
01[02:26] <03banana> 6KJ: "He probably did. But we've caught this early, you told us about it- things have not gone too far to be fixed."
01[02:27] <03banana> "Do you want to call Count Ma? Is he- how would he take this sort of thing?"
[02:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Do you remember what it felt like to know you were going to die?"
01[02:34] <03banana> 6Once Frances is busy on the phone or despairing again, whichever, KJ's going to turn to a faint glimmer of hope. "Pearl- you know someone who's been in this situation?" 
[02:35] <03Quaker> Frances: “Okay, I…no, he’d be supportive…I’ll…I’ll call him…” She takes out her phone, dials, and steps away. “Sherman? It’s…me.” 
[02:35] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Plenty.” 
[02:35] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Yes. I remember hoping it would be soon.” 
[02:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "And then it never came."
[02:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And now it never might."
01[02:36] <03banana> "Any of them get out from under? How much does Bren push for?"
[02:36] <03Crion> 4He drives above the speed limit and arrives within ten minutes. He's inside less than a minute after that, smile already crawling across his face.
[02:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't know. It seems sort of perverse to want anything when nothing lasts forever but you. You know?"
[02:37] <03Quaker> Rush and Buchanan are waiting for him at the doors. “He’s still in the conference room, Mr. Cavanaugh. Three men with him. I assume it’s about the, um, legal unpleasantries involving Souza.” 
[02:37] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “I never thought I’d live forever. I’m sure I’ll die. But know I can choose a time that suits me. I’ll never again worry that I’ll end when it pleases someone else.” 
01[02:38] <03banana> "This isn't something I've had to deal with," she lies, "but it sure fucking reminds me of growing up in Oakland on other peoples' payday loans."
[02:38] <03Crion> 4The grin threatens to almost tear the seams of his mouth. "Three men. How many of them are Kindred."
[02:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What's the point of living or dying if it doesn't please someone else?"
[02:38] <03Quaker> Pearl shrugs. “Not many. A lot.” 
[02:39] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “You can share your life with someone else. But your death. Your future. They belong to you, and no one else.” 
[02:40] <03Quaker> Rush walks with him towards the conference room. “All of them. They seemed…hardened. But not aggressive.” 
[02:40] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Both of you go home for the night. I'll either text you after this, or I won't. If I don't, go to the Judex and get yourselves into self-preservation mode."
[02:41] <03Quaker> Both of the ghouls look hesistant to leave. “We could…,” Buchanan begins. “You shouldn’t go in there alone,” says Rush. “We have…there’s guns in the back-“ 
[02:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ambition."
[02:42] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You're not going to shoot Donald Bren and his secret police to death. You'd just get yourselves killed."
[02:42] <03Crion> "Get the hell out of here. That's an order."
01[02:42] <03banana> 6To Pearl and Jessie: "I don't know Sherman Ma. But I won't- I don't want to stand by if Frances gets hurt in this."
[02:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I like the poppies better. And the company."
01[02:43] <03banana> "It would be safest, for each of us, if that person did not get involved. You know that at least as well as I do, right?"
[02:43] <03Quaker> Jessie: “Oh, he’s nice enough. A bit distant.” 
01[02:43] <03banana> 6KJ's got a text message.
[02:43] <03Crion> 4Meanwhile, from the backseat of Cav's car, two lithe forms slink out an open window and up onto the building's roof.
[02:43] <03Quaker> Pearl: “She might want to ‘take the L’. Is that enough to get me into your club, by the way?” 
01[02:44] <03banana> 6What
[02:44] <03Quaker> Pearl: “I saw it on twitter.” 
01[02:44] <03banana> 6To Cavanaugh: <PLEASE do not borrow any money from him.>
01[02:45] <03banana> 6KJ: "It definitely is, Pearl."
[02:45] <03Quaker> The two ghouls leave the office. 
[02:45] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Then as a member, I sponsor Jessie’s entry.” 
[02:45] <03Crion> 4Cav makes sure his smile shows just the right bit of fang, then opens the door to his conference room.
[02:45] <03Crion> 4Cav, smiling: "Count Bren. How the hell are you?"
01[02:45] <03banana> 6To Jessie: "You got lucky!"
[02:47] <03Quaker> Frances returns, a smile of relief plastered across her face.

01[02:48] <03banana> 6That's.. good?
[02:48] <03Quaker> Lancaster: “Exercise it. Or you’ll be the one transformed by force from a subject to an object.” 
[02:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's not enough, though, is it? That's the pretension of this whole mess. We go to all this trouble to build this place where we can be friends. But it's not enough anyway."
[02:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're just as hungry as the rest."
01[02:49] <03banana> 6These people count on their sires for so much, but they're so tied down. KJ still thinks she's got the advantage in missing out, but.. you could play devil's advocate.
[02:49] <03Quaker> Frances: “It’s okay. He listened.” 
[02:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Quietly, barely to Blythe: "What am I hungry for?"
01[02:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "Listened, and.. is able to resolve the situation with his resources and foreknowledge? And I've worried you for nothing?"
01[02:51] <03banana> "Because that would be a hell yes."
[02:51] <03Quaker> The Countess is silent for a moment. The air of the greenhouse is thick with moisture and fragrance. He can see its neighbors, each lit brightly in the darkness, stretching off into the horizon. There must be hundreds. 
[02:52] <03Quaker> Blythe crosses the distance between them, and kisses the Baron Hollywood. 
[02:52] <03Quaker> Frances: “Oh, yeah. He’s going to kill him tonight.”

[02:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's rare in the Imperial City to find a patrician household of this size without at least one servant.
[02:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> There used to be a cook and a maid, but they quit some years ago and efforts to replace them have been brief and fitful. Difficulties, people whisper, with the children.
[02:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't think these dumplings are all the way cooked..."
[02:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> Saya pokes at her lunch. The dough is still a little raw. "I said, I don't-"
[02:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "MAYBE YOU SHOULD COOK YOUR OWN LUNCH THEN!" The whole table rattles when Akane pounds it like a regiment answering alarum.
[02:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> Saya seems to get an inch or two shorter. "sorryitsfine"
[02:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> The middle child doesn't say anything. She's taken the candle from the middle of the table and is holding it to her dumplings experimentally, in hopes that she can cook each individual one herself. The trick is to do it from beneath, so you don't get wax on the food.
[02:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> Akane pushes her own bowl away after a single bite. "They came out fine yesterday..." she says before misery and her hands cover her face.
[02:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> Saya: "If we hurry, the baker will still have steamed buns for sale."
[02:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> Akane perks up. "Which baker?"
[02:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Old Ming! Remember, with the grandson who you-"
[02:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Uggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh."
[02:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I wasn't that hungry anyway," Akane convinces herself.
[02:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> Misuzu finally looks up. The candle's flame lights her face from beneath. "You could get them cheap. He'll think you'll break his other leg if he tries to haggle."

[08:13] <03@Ferrinus> "Oh, him?" 12a market musician answers Ir. "That's the Hero. Been fightin' to defend us against the darkness for, oh, years." 12The green-clad youth, a sun-and-eye crest on his mirrored shield, has already wandered out to the main market.
[08:14] <03Crion> 4Ir:"Uh huh." 
[08:15] <03Crion> 4Her mind's already racing. Another one of the Chosen wasn't part of the deal.
[08:16] <03Crion> 4Especially if he's working with (for?) the Fair Folk, and he can play an instrument.
[08:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya's found an open plaza that hosts what must be the daylit court's orchestra. It's a motley of elfin humans (or humanoids) and plant-creatures all playing together on a collection of mostly woodwinds and stringed instruments, all watched over by a massive woman of sylvan aspect. She's dozing or daydreaming or something, only barely paying attention as they practice, but her 
[08:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12long, leafy hair cascades down and across the floor the musicians play on and there's a strong sense they're dependent on her somehow.
[08:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, down in the world of mortals, all hell has broken loose as Blossom and Eikichi have seized control of mining sorcery, used it to collapse an entire series of tunnels, and then found their attempt to simply freakin' bolt arrested by a young Cathak swordsman. He's snarling at them from beneath his helm, leaving burning footprints in the air as he stands on the dust and grit 
[08:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12kicked up by the floating Stormwind Rider.
[08:17] <03dammitwho> 7What the heck!
[08:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "UGH. Can you knock him off or something?"
[08:18] <03Crion> 4Ir resolves to try and stay out his way, more than anything else. But that won't be possible if he's got powerful friends in the castle, and there's no waya kid like that doesn't have powerful friends in the castle.
[08:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12The sorcerers are sort of eyeing each other and trying to figure out if they should be pulling daggers. The various landbound foes of Eikichi and Blossom aren't so conflicted, though - a hail of rocks and arrows come flying up at them!
[08:27] <03dammitwho> 7From within the shower of missiles comes one arrow that flies straight and true, as if Heaven itself smiles on the bowman. The Essence of air courteously withdraws, so as to offer no resistance- swifter than eagles it races toward the mark. Blossom doesn't notice any of this, and ducks her head to the side. The arrow hisses past her and shatters on a nearby rock.
[08:27] <03trenchfoot> 6Hmm. Tatsuya's not exactly in a position to strike openly, here, so he'll have to settle for gathering information. Is there any fiddler among the group that's distinguishing themselves right now?
[08:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Has it got to be a fiddler? The star of the show's got what'd be a fiddler in a human's hands, but he's playing it as though it were a cello.
[08:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, Blossom's assailant is what's probably a man clad in the same black and red Cathak armor that the rest of this unit of guardsmen is wearing. He's got a very nice bow, though, a curve of glittering steel strung with what might be silk. None of his fellows care, as far as you can tell.
[08:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12The more he watches, the more Tatsuya gets the idea that very few of the musicians here are, like... real? Or, at least, possessed of independent vitality. The great majority of them, particularly those with leafy features or who are literally just stubby-limbed, leaf-masked plants, look to be nothing more than extensions of the dozing sylvan giant - who's got to be some kind of 
[08:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12visitor or immigrant to this particular freehold, since her aesthetic's so far off from that of most of the denizens Tatsuya's seen around.
[08:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12One of the musicians, that woman with the flute, is a (mutated and ensorcelled) human, but she's nothing special as flautists go. The little cello-playing turnip, too, seems self-willed somehow - but, in particular, is still an offshoot or even belonging of the greater fairy. Like, he sort of fades a bit when she's not paying  attention to him directly.
[08:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Sabotaging the orchestra probably means sabotaging the raksha that owns it, somehow, OR symbolically stealing the performers or their instruments from the raksha.
[08:48] <03trenchfoot> 6Well, he doesn't currently have a way to make fire on hand, so the easiest way of sabotage is out. Stealing performers and/or instruments, however... that can be done.
[08:51] <03Crion> 4Ir's still biding her time. Probably not worth it making many waves until the social event she's been sponsored for.
[08:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12Much more dangerous than the poorly-aimed boulders is a reverse rainstorm of deadly arrows! Neither Solar is actually scathed, but Blossom's all but fallen out of the Stormwind Rider in the course of evading the countless arrowheads. It's awful when enemy forces are both well-trained and lucky.
[08:55] <03dammitwho> 7One arrow can be dodged, but dozens? Blossom's hands fly to slap the missiles out of the air before they can hit her, but they're faster than she can move and she's losing ground quickly!
[09:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10C'monnnnnnn
[09:04] <03dammitwho> "Get LOST!" 7Blossom cups her hands and grows a rapidly spinning sphere of fire between them, throwing it at the enraged Dynast. The flames themselves might not bother a child of that element, but the force of the impact still sends him reeling!
[09:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Dynast: "Gyaaah! You think your- you think that's- rrggh-...!"
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, it seems to me that Tatsuya's at liberty to attempt to sneak in and work some kind of sabotage right now, or brazenly confront the wood-raksha for whatever reason, or lay low and wait for a better or more obvious opportunity. Meanwhile, Ir's got little to do but see to the occasional favors her patron might ask of her until such time as the sun sets and she's taken to play 
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12at the castle.
[09:21] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya will hold out for a better chance -- wading into a crowd is just asking for trouble, and the wood-raksha, while a tempting target, is foolish to go after right now.
[09:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12As Blossom aims a firebolt at her almost-hidden assailant, she might be given to notice a flickering of crimson starlight just under the brow of his helmet...
[09:30] <03dammitwho> "Heeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaarrrrghhh!" 7Her fireball burns toward the archer, but his answering arrow... splits it! Stunned, Blossom barely has time to avoid the arrow as it zips past her ear.
[09:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom meets the eye of the man who launched the counterstroke, but he looks - uncertain, almost panicked.
[09:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nope nope nope. Last time Eikichi flew into battle with Blossom in the Rider he had to wash her blood out of his hair. Looks like Team Solar's blasting off again...!
[09:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Now that Eikichi's wise to the way this dynast moves, he can counter it - sort of suck in the bottom of the stormwind rider to deny the man any rungs or shelfs of whirling air, spin and bulge the center to dislodge him and push him backwards. In a blur of motion, the two Solars have hitched themselves back over the cliff face they dropped down from, and while a torrent of rocks and 
[09:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12arrowheads comes drumming against the stone or flying over their heads, it's not enough to so much as slow them down.
[09:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Should we stop and rest or go now?"
[09:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Ir's at liberty to follow the Hero's journeys at a distance if she wants. He visits the blacksmith... the tavern... the potion shop... the barracks... looks like a fairly practiced routine of equipment upkeep and news investigation.
[09:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya's just about ready to creep out of line of sight entirely when he notices the golden gleam of a half-lidded eye is aimed right at him. In a langorous voice, the green-skinned raksha murmurs: "You like what you hear?"
[09:44] <03Crion> 4Ir might as well keep tabs on him, but she's not going to creep around the damn village after him or anything.
[09:47] <03dammitwho> "I'm all right if you are." 7She slaps his shoulder, grinning. "Oh my GODS did you SEE that archer?!"
[09:47] <03trenchfoot> 6Shit. Let his guard down. He turns towards the raksha as casual as someone who just got caught sneaking around can possibly be. "It's... pretty good."
[09:48] <03dammitwho> "Arrow right through a fireball! I'm sure he's terrified now, but he'll drink for weeks off that!"
[09:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That was a really lucky shot."
[09:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He probably won't drink for weeks off that, though. He'll probably die like the rest of them.
[09:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12The raksha: "Oh, I should hope. I try... I take great pains. Perhaps they'd not have invited me, otherwise..." 12The shrugs a shoulder and shifts position on the colonnade she's lounging on. "...but what brought you here?"
[09:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Will he, though, Eikichi's and Blossom are given to wonder. He was really good. Really good - and though he was sure to wear a snug, scalp-shielding helmet, both Solars are pretty sure they saw at least a hint of crimson when that final arrow was loosed.
[09:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Crimson? What does that mean?
[09:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12Plus, that bow looked a bit too fancy. ...still, it's a hard thought to hold onto, and while either of our heroes can if they really try, they'll have a devil of a time getting anyone else to remember.
[09:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom has basically forgotten already.
[09:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh gods."
[09:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That red flare... it's another agent of Heaven, isn't it? What was it... violet is the color of Saturn, blue of Venus, green of Jupiter, yellow of Mercury... red of Mars? A Chosen of Mars?"
[09:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Mars... the maiden of battles.
[09:59] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "What?"
[10:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The archer! There was a red glow on their brow, beneath their helmet. Remember how Yara had a violet mark?"
[10:02] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Oh! Sure, I guess. I didn't see anything like that, but if you did..." 7She sounds disappointed.
[10:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What's wrong?"
[10:03] <03dammitwho> "I was really rooting for him when I thought he was just some mortal who made a once-in-a-lifetime shot."
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Heaven seems to have a way of sucking the fun out of everything."
[10:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya and Blossom are, at the moment, whirling across the landscape. They're moving much faster than anyone at the last mine can follow... well, anyone but the sorcerers, but as half of them just betrayed the other half there's some logistical confusion there that's preventing rapid chase even if someone does know how to conjure the Rider.
[10:04] <03dammitwho> 7Tatsuya and Blossom, huh.
[10:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Er, Eikichi and Blossom.
[10:04] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Oh well. Onward!"
[10:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Phew, almost spoiled a big twist there.
[10:05] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Got lost. Heard some nice tunes, figured I'd check them out." 6He's too frazzled to make up a good lie.
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Haaaa-
[10:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12This seems to please the fairy. "Which is your favorite?"
[10:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Stormwind Riders are terrifyingly fast. It's not even half an hour before Blossom and Eikichi are coming up on the location of what they know to be the other viable mine. Will they take a breather, or charge right in?
[10:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We're going now.
[10:10] <03dammitwho> 7Yeah!!
[10:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Hwaaah! ...okay, so this looks a lot more like a normal mining camp. Railways along which carts piled with rubble are being pushed, tents and cabins and lean-tos holding the laborers, a contingent of mortal guards.
[10:14] <03Crion> 4Ir spends her next however long practicing a new technique -- changing Iscariot's shape from a six-string to other, longer-bodied string instruments in the middle of the song. It's not the shaping itself that's hard -- the moonsilver is very responsive. It's the tuning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0kQKdv_FBU
[10:15] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "The little one, with the fiddle. And the lady with the flute. Pretty talented, I thought. And, uh, the--" 6He whistles a decent facsimile of the opening to the tune they were just playing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDKFFv3MSjg
[10:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12She laughs to herself, pleased as punch as far as Tatsuya can tell. "Yes! Yes, how I love him. I should name him soon."
[10:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12A sidelong glance. "...but she's slipping a little. For all this freehold's riches, they're short on real performers."
[10:18] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Hm." 6What's her angle...
[10:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi can tell, looking at the carts of excavated rubble, that this is definitely where the earth-shaping gemstone is at work; rather than craggy and rough-edged as they would be if worked loose by picks and hammers, the the chunks of liberated earth here are rounded, visibly kneaded into shape by palm and fingerprints. The grade of the material, though, suggests it's been dug up 
[10:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12from quite deep indeed... meaning the hearthstone itself isn't up here in the camp.
[10:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12The digging operation must have proceeded far enough apace that they've moved the hearthstone itself down into the tunnels so as to extend the radius of hand-workable stone as deep as can be.
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Tunnel big enough to fly into?
[10:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Up here, you'll find those laborers currently off their shifts, and, unfortunately, a small army of highly-alarmed guards.
[10:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12It is, but you don't know how long it stays wide enough. At the moment, Cathak soldiers are rushing to raise the alarm and block off the entrance.
[10:27] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "...so he plays like that and doesn't even have a name? What's his. I dunno. How's he do that?"
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya's interlocutor peers at him further. "Oh, you know. I dreamed up a good musician... and another... and another. Most of them I threw away. Some I spun from raw gossamer, other from the elements, other from some dreams I found or traded for..."
[10:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Raksha: "I forgot what I put into this little one, honestly. But he hasn't bored me yet. You don't know any good names, do you?"
[10:30] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'm terrible with them, honestly."
[10:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12Raksha: "Mmm, then I'll keep looking. I just hope he doesn't disappoint... though perhaps it wouldn't be too bad if he did."
[10:31] <03Crion|> 4Soon Ir will have teased out three specific variants of Iscariot, the stringed instrument -- the six-string, a larger four stringed variant she drops down like a cello, and a fiddle she can pop up onto her shoulder. The hard part -- the really hard part -- is teasing out a bow. The moonsilver doesn't want to separate, and definitely doesn't want to provide the friction against itself 
[10:31] <03Crion|> 4necessary for sound. Soon she figures out the trick: some hair from Errant's mane and some careful practice, and the bow will leap out of the instrument's body, thread the bowstring, and remain connected by the thinnest tendril while playing.
[10:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12Raksha: "This is a nice place, but... staying...? Mmmm..."
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We can just fly right over them before they put arrow to string..."
[10:32] <03Crion|> 4She probably can't get a full string standup bass out of this thing, sadly -- not with the right sound, anyway.
[10:32] <03Crion|> 4But wind instruments might be a fun challenge down the line.
[10:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi's not wrong. It's a harrowing dive straight down over the lip of a cliff face and then into a wide mine tunnel atop a magical whirlwind, but, apparently, a possible one - the motion's so fast and sudden that the Cathak guards have only started firing arrows by the time Eikichi and Blossom are already deep into the tunnel.
[10:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12It starts branching, though...
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Might be worth sticking around. You never know who might show up here to keep things interesting."
[10:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Raksha: "Mmm. Well... the same to you, human. I hope I'll see you tonight. ...stick around for the rehearsal, if you like." 12She turns again, shifting idly until she's lying on her back with one great arm hanging down so her fingers brush the auditorium floor. Beneath and beside her, her orchestra plays on.
[10:42] <03trenchfoot> 6Well, that went poorly. It could've gone worse, but he still hasn't actually managed to help Ir at all.
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We've all been there.
[10:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, if nothing else it's intel. The weak spot in the orchestra is the mortal - of which there's only one, which is a good thing if you're worried about being able to collect people quickly and completely - and the star performer's a semi-autonomous belonging of a raksha master. Conceivably you could do something with any or all of that.
[10:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Of course, Tatsuya still has the opportunity for some kind of insane hit and run here.
[11:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12It'd be a shame, of course... why not just kick back and listen?
[11:00] <03trenchfoot> 6Ir's probably got it all under control. What's the harm in just listening to some tunes?
[11:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom and Eikichi race along the mine tunnels, following the handprints dug into the walls and the sparkling, pearly gradient of the distant hearthstone's power that only Eikichi can actually see. For a while they're able to whirl down broad, well-lit, and widely-excavated tunnels, but it's not long before Eikichi's forced to throttle the Stormwind Rider's speed and then either 
[11:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12fold it into its personal transport mode or banish it all together.
[11:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Let's just walk.
[11:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Then it's just running - maybe walking, as Eikichi's going to get winded - towards the prize. The deeper you go, the more actual miners you see, but it seems like some kind of alarm's been raised already - they mostly scream and dive for side tunnels as they see you approaching. You can hear the shouting and marching of the guardsmen somewhere behind you, but you've got a substantial 
[11:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12head start.
[11:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Whew! This is a lot easier than the other one."
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12You turn a corner, and there you are - a wide, partially-excavated hall. On a pedestal rests what must be the Earth-Shaping Jewel, an egg of gleaming amber ensconced within a half-complete shell of craggy granite. Right before it, crouched in some sort of meditation, is Cathak Kalza - she's fully armored, holding her reaper daiklave before her, a few inches of the gleaming silver-blue 
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12blade visible between the hilt and the scabbard. The terrestrial exalt has her head bowed and is murmuring to herself, and Eikichi can see some kind of magic being drawn forth out of the blade, swirling around Kalza's head and pouring into her anima.
[11:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Uh-
[11:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is she praying to it?
[11:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12Beside Kalza is a huge man with a hammer that glows with furnace heat. Flanking both terrestrials is a contingent of Cathak soldiers; cowering away from it all are a number of workers.
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elsewhere, Tatsuya and Ir, in their own ways, wile away the day. If Tatsuya wants to just chill and enjoy some tunes, he's unbothered; any castle guards that come marching down the hall are simply shooed away by the gigantic Miaja before they can notice and object to the mortal interloper. Ir, meanwhile, is largely unmolested by the other denizens of the freehold; as she's in Rajiezna's 
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12care, she won't be challenged by the guard or dragooned into the military or similar.
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She's talking to the sword. And the sword's talking back.
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Whoa.
[11:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12Day turns to dusk turns to night, and soon Ir's summoned - the political affairs of the Daylit Court have been concluded, and so it's time for the much more important matters of mingling, gossip, and revelry. Does Ir suffer to be dressed up?
[11:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Similarly, does Tatsuya want to join the orchestra? He can get set up with a whistle, or maybe some drums...
[11:15] <03trenchfoot> 6He'll leave that to the professionals. Besides, he's here to support Ir. He'll have to find a place where he can do so, in case things go south.
[11:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12The moment Eikichi and Blossom step into the room, Kalza snaps her head up to glare at them, Kalza's ally snorts and seizes the hearthstone in one gauntleted hand, and Kalza's troops raise their weapons.
[11:15] <03dammitwho> 7Hrmph.
[11:16] <03Crion|> 4Sure, why not. But she'll keep her armor close.
[11:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12The lady Rajiezna likes reds, yellows, floppy hats, and enormous feathers. Ir makes it look good, though. (That's in comparison to Rajiezna and closer members of her retinue, who make it look sublime if you ignore the too-perfect symmetries and other uncanny elements of faerie appearance). So it is that the Solar skald finds herself marching into a great ballroom sort of chamber a 
[11:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12few hours past sunset.
[11:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir has, at this point, a good headcount of mortals present in the Freehold. She counts four of them here - one in the orchestra, three others acting as servants or squires for the attending raksha. She knows there are maybe twenty in total back in the rest of the Freehold, either sleeping in beds, sweeping streets, or tending to the graveyard outside the church.
[11:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's an orchestra playing at the side of the room, of course, framed against a great opening in the castle wall such that just a few pillars, veils, and curtains of vines separate them from the night sky. If Tatsuya isn't formally among them, he's teeeechnically not allowed to be here... and is therefore, presumably, hiding or in disguise.
[11:24] <03Crion|> 4When she walks in, she'll be wearing Iscariot as a serpentine armband bracelet that twists up around each arm decoratively, across her shoulders, and down the other arm. She's not showing an immodest amount of skin, but she's showing enough that the whole of the weapon is visible.
[11:25] <03Crion|> 4She realized while dressing she's looking less muscular and more simply athletic these days, though her battle prowess hasn't suffered for it. Consequence of a having a residency rather than tromping around the wastes climbing every damn thing for months. Irritating in some respects, but she does make the dress look good.
[11:27] <03trenchfoot> 6He's there, but out of view. Little trickier to make work than a disguise, but less risk of getting called out.
[11:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Besides the broad assortment of achingly beautiful pointy-eared nobles, who broadly exist along a spectrum from 'foppish aristocrat' to 'rugged knight', there are a few other personalities of note. There's a bearded, golden-eyed old man in long white robes... Xalvierre, the mountain-dwelling master. There's an armed and armored woman easily seven feet tall with a great mane of 
[11:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12blood-red hair... the captain of the guard, Corazelle. Then there's the royals.
[11:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12The king of the daylit court, a short, portly, white-haired elf who everyone only refers to by his title. The beloved princess Naeva, a slim and solemn figure whose features are mostly hidden by white veils. The high priest of the Church of Balor, a hunched and fussy-looking faerie called Narvithex whose eyes and mouth are hidden by bushy brows and a bushy mustache, respectively. Ir 
[11:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12knows all these names because the lords and ladies around her whisper them to each other.
[11:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Here's the scheduling: there'll be some mingling, then some performances - music included - then more mingling, then around midnight the night will be largely over. Ir gets the sense that there'll be a bit of an unspoken competition in the middle there, but mostly what's at stake is the relative status of the raksha present. If she wants to throw down some kind of gauntlet or otherwise 
[11:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12toss a wrench into the workings of the court, she'll have to pick her moment and then, well, do it.
[11:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Underground, Eikichi and Blossom can tell that they're in easily the most viable of Cathak's digs. The very wall behind Kalza is mostly intact stone, but visible through a few cracks and finer-swipes is a glittering basalt reminiscent of the Sword pylon the Circle first convened at far to the north.
[11:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12Given your location relative to the middle of the range, that's probably some kind of peripheral stabilizing infrastructure rather than an entrance to the pylon proper, but still.
[11:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Kalza: "You've trapped yourselves."
[11:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yep."
[11:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Scared?"
[11:35] <03Crion|> 4Ir will mingle, then, and wait.
[11:36] <03Crion|> 4And see if she can't figure out where the hell Tatsuya is.
[11:36] <03Crion|> 4Is he here in disguise, or...?
[11:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya is currently hiding out in the rafters, prowling around and waiting for a moment to strike. If necessary. Which makes it rather difficult to give Ir a sign that he hasn't just fucked off and shirked his duties, but, well, he already did that once.
[11:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's a click as Cathak Kalza fully sheaths her reaper daiklave. "No."
[11:44] <03Crion|> 4This is almost like being in a room full of Eikichis, except they're more open about the fact that they fuck and have trouble understanding lesser creatures.
[11:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10IDTS HARD
[11:46] <03Crion|> 4I'll bet.
[11:46] <03trenchfoot> 6TMI.
[11:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Our heroes confront the Cathak and the Raksha directly... next week.

[22:40] <03Quaker> On a Saturday evening, Baron Clinton Cavanaugh finds himself in a nearly empty office. He can see four figures sitting motionless beyond the frosted glass of the conference room. Rush and Buchananan have left, after protesting that he shouldn’t walk into a situation like this alone. 
[22:40] <03Quaker> Maybe they were right? Anyway, he still has his phone, and all the time in the world to think about what he’ll do next. 
[22:41] <03Crion|> 4They certainly weren't wrong. But they weren't the people to walk into that room with.
[22:41] <03Quaker> Meanwhile, at the club, KJ has just been told that she’s indirectly responsible for (maybe?) starting a blood feud between Frances Yuan’s sire, Count Sherman Ma, and Donald Bren. 
01[22:42] <03banana> 6Given the last text message Baron Laguna sent, his phone's blowing up around now.
03[22:42] * Crion| is now known as Crion
01[22:42] <03banana> 6Not with anything as gauche as a phone call, because this is 2017, but- KJ's not putting a single emoji in here.
[22:43] <03Quaker> Also meanwhile, Wilson is standing in the low ambient hum of the greenhouse, having been kissed. Countess Lancaster hasn’t said anything. Her phone, though, keeps beeping with text notifications. Actually, so is Wilson’s. 
[22:43] <03Crion> 4He'll pause to check his phone before walking in, at least.
[22:43] <03Quaker> Meanwhile meanwhile, Tommy’s still in the fucking basement- 
01[22:44] <03banana> 6To the gathering at Yuan's beautiful, shitty club: "Just a sec. I need to save a life again." <Did you say Lord Bren? Switch to Signal, did you install Signal like I said>
[22:44] <03Crion> 4Cav did.
[22:44] <03Crion> 4He still needs a couple seconds to find the app in his menus, though.
01[22:45] <03banana> 6There's a contact request waiting and some sort of clickthrough message about private keys? 9<This is KJ Valentine. Count Ma has sworn to kill Bren tonight, like irl 9>
[22:45] <03tom> 14The phone rumbles. He checks it, scowls. <are you fucking kidding me>
[22:46] <03Crion> 4Cav, in the past, before leaving for the office, to Tommy: <nope>
[22:46] <03tom> "Hey Sponger, you know I trust you, right."
[22:46] <03Crion> 4Now, to KJ: <uh>
[22:46] <03Crion> 4To KJ: <do we have>
[22:46] <03tom> "Aw shit, Soria's still out isn't he. Fuck!"
[22:46] <03Crion> 4To KJ: <any more information on that>
[22:46] <03tom> "Alright, so it's on me."
[22:47] <03Quaker> Sponger: “Okay.” 
[22:47] <03Quaker> The Carmelite pauses. “What’s on you?” 
[22:48] <03tom> "Looks like Bren's making a power play, Cav's there already."
01[22:48] <03banana>  9<I am coming to you live from not knowing a fucking thing. Hold on9> 
01[22:48] <03banana> 6KJ: "Frances, how good is your sire at this sort of thing? Like has this.. come up before?"
01[22:48] <03banana> "It's kind of reassuring, kind of worrying. A lot of people could get involved."
[22:48] <03tom> "I might need you to stay here while I go deal with that fucking mess, and not leave."
[22:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10In a moment like this, your pulse quickens. Your mouth goes dry. Wilson remembers. There's all these physical signals. But you don't get those when you're dead. The buzzing of the phone is a vulgar substitute. "Blythe..."
[22:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: <if you wanna join in, get over to> 4Address goes here. <and tell sponger to stay put. Brens gonna have people in the area looking for him if hes making this bold aplay>
[22:53] <03tom> 14Meanwhile, Tommy has moved out across the hallway into his own, far messier room across the way from Sponger, where he is stuffing handfulls of shotgun shells into the pockets of his hoodie.
01[22:53] <03banana> 6KJ's listening to any chatter from her friends(? are they friends, that would be nice) but she's still half head-down. More comms to send. In particular she needs to send a timely notification to Baron Helena Murray that she's received intel Clinton Cavanaugh will be meeting Donald Bren tonight, by the slowest conceivable method.
[22:54] <03Quaker> Mail pony? 
01[22:54] <03banana> 6Passenger pigeon? Instruction to a ghoul to leave a handwritten message in a dead drop? God damn it.
01[22:54] <03banana> 6Maybe she could tape a letter to a snail and stamp the date on it-
[22:56] <03Quaker> Blythe finishes scrolling through her new messages, and looks up at Baron Hollywood. “Do you want to borrow my helicopter?” 
[22:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "To where?" 10He hasn't checked his phone yet. He's still a little flat-footed.
[22:59] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Laguna Beach. Cavanaugh is meeting Donald Bren. Apparently Count Ma is on his way, ready to kill Bren. Something over his childe and a bad loan.” 
[22:59] <03Crion> 4To stall for time, Cav is in the small office's adjunct kitchen, putting on a rather large pot of coffee.
[22:59] <03Quaker> Frances thinks about it: “Well, I mean…he’s really good at killing the witches every year when we go hunting…” 
[22:59] <03tom> 14Tommy is fucking around on his phone while stepping out the door. <omw>
[23:00] <03tom> 14He pockets the phone, kneels down, tightens his shoelaces.
[23:00] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Do you know the difference between a Baron and a Count?” 
01[23:01] <03banana> 6KJ: "A hundred years and the drive for personal conquest."
[23:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sherman? Donald?"
01[23:04] <03banana> 6Pearl, at least, 'gets' how incredibly fucking big a deal this is, right? How much is about to be reshaped? Is KJ going to have to take sides again.
[23:05] <03Quaker> Blythe nods. “I’d go, but. Actually, someone should tell -“ She taps on her keys. “Okay, the Prince knows. The helicopter should be fueling right now.” 
[23:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "So, what, I swoop in on a chopper and ask everyone to please be nice? Sticking my nose in that seems like a good way to piss everyone off without being able to help." 10I guess we're not talking about that. Alright, fine.
[23:11] <03Crion> 4Cav looks around the office as the coffee drips. He had Buchanan and Rush take their iMacs with them when they left, so other than the computers in his office, there's not too much to be lost here if, well.
[23:11] <03tom> 14The Nosferatu is bouncing on his knees in the parking lot after slapping in his earbuds. His phone is low on battery. He's almost out of data for the month. It's time.
[23:12] <03Crion> 4He pours himself a large cup of coffee, takes a saucer out for it, and begins walking towards the conference room.
[23:12] <03tom> 14He gives himself the entire length of the first track on his 'ass kicking mix' to get to the office where sits Donald Bren. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89F5fpvwPr0
[23:16] <03Crion> 4Cav will meet him as he comes in, coffee in hand. "Bren and three others."
01[23:16] <03banana> 6KJ to Cavanaugh: 9<I'm informed that Ma is 'really good at killing', otoh Bren is a fucking monster 🐗, you should probably leave right now9>
[23:16] <03tom> 14The nosferatu is a grey blur between dumpsters and down alleyways, each footprint hitting the pavement with piston force, scattering detritus and throwing up tiny puffs of dust with each impact.
[23:17] <03Crion> 4To KJ: <not running from my own damn office>
[23:18] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I’m just offering a ride. Don’t feel obligated to do anything.” 
[23:20] <03tom> 14Down into a dry culvert, ducking low down the length of the pipe, then back out onto gravel.
01[23:21] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<What? Why not?? 9>
01[23:21] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<What? Why not?? 9>
[23:21] <03Quaker> The door to the conference room opens. A figure steps out into the hallway, walking towards Cav…
[23:22] <03Crion> 4Cav sips his coffee. Which one is it.
[23:22] <03Quaker> The tiny woman in her late twenties stops in front of the Baron. “Excuse me, where’s your restroom?” 
[23:23] <03Crion> 4Cav smiles, showing fang, and pivots to his right, pointing to a door against the far wall marked as a unisex single bathroom. This one have a Beast?
[23:24] <03Quaker> “Thank you.” She does, but the fact that she’s Blushing makes this request a little less strange. The door closes behind her. 
[23:26] <03Quaker> As Lancaster types on her phone, Wilson can read her pretty easily - she’s not making any effort to hide her mood in his presence, after all. She’s irritated at the sudden nature of the events, excited at the prospect of violence against Bren, and frustrated that 1) she probably shouldn’t intervene personally 2) letting this play out naturally probably isn’t the most responsible thing to do. 
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson checks his phone. Has he just got the message from Cavanaugh?
[23:30] <03Quaker> Has Tommy ever been to Cav’s office before? It’s in a deserted business park, quite emptied of civilian cars. In the night breeze, he can smell the ocean salt mixing with the lower smells of the dozens of willows and eucalyptus ringing the property. 
[23:31] <03tom> 14Not personally. This will be a first. But it's good to get this route down so he can remember this in the future.
[23:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ah, hell. Cav gets a text: <Where's the best spot to land a helicopter?>
[23:32] <03Crion> 4Uhh
[23:32] <03Quaker> Jessie asks KJ: “So, what are you going to do now?” 
[23:32] <03Crion> 4To Baron Hollywood: <parking lots empty>
[23:33] <03tom> 14Tommy comes jogging up to the building, shotgun in his hands. He's breathing pretty heavily, but that's temporary, and entirely somatic. He quells the impulse with a hard swallow, nods to himself, and heads indoors.
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: "Try not to ruin any more nights out."
[23:33] <03tom> 14He pats down his scraggly hair.
[23:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> <This is so stupid.>
[23:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Blythe: "Sure you don't want to come? It'd destabilize the entire city..."
01[23:34] <03banana> 6KJ: "I've got a bunch of research to do and constituents to keep up with. Nothing that couldn't wait a few hours, though. It'll all be there tomorrow.. maybe."
[23:35] <03Quaker> Jessie: “My night’s not ruined! This is exciting…” She aims the bubble bobble shooter at a clump of red orbs on her phone.  
01[23:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "It kind of is. Not knowing who's going to come out on top.. and what they could be doing."
[23:36] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Try not to. Or you’ll have to leave the house more often.” 
01[23:36] <03banana> "Does anyone run a book on this stuff??"
[23:37] <03Crion> 4To Wilson: <not wrong>
[23:38] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Ma can’t take Bren in a duel. But he won’t need to.” 
[23:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Alright, I'll do my best. I guess I gotta come back at some point to pick out my painting."
[23:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Gonna be hard to do if we're all double-dog dead."
01[23:40] <03banana> 6KJ: "He won't need to... because they'll discuss it calmly like adults and come to an agreement..?"
[23:42] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Oh. Maybe. But Ma’s best friend is Augustine Garcia.” She says it like KJ should know what that means. 
01[23:42] <03banana> 6KJ puts down her phone. This is not something she has any power over.
[23:44] <03Quaker> The Ventrue returns from the bathroom, arriving at Cav’s lingering position at the same time as Tommy. “Good evening.” She curtseys. “Baron…” She looks at the pair, and decides on the unscarred one. “You must be Baron Laguna,” she says to Cav. “Enchanté.” 
[23:45] <03Crion> 4Cav's still smiling. "I haven't had the pleasure."
01[23:46] <03banana> 6KJ: "I did not know that. That's a lot of guns."
[23:46] <03tom> 14Tommy is stuffing the sawed-off into his hoodie.
[23:47] <03tom> 14Look, intent is a part of the law. Not necessarily a major part, but it's there.
01[23:47] <03banana> 6Now that she does know, of course, it's going in the database.
[23:48] <03Quaker> The tiny Ventrue: “America Hall, Baroness Lakewood. I hope we haven’t put you out. We realized we hadn’t paid you a social visit since your elevation, and, well, nine tenths of neighborliness is welcoming you to the neighborhood. This is….?” She’s looking at Tommy, waiting for an introduction with a hand stretched out politely. 
[23:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Delighted. Permit me to introduce Deacon Thomas Saldana, of the Lancea et Sanctum."
01[23:50] <03banana> 6KJ: "You know, maybe we shouldn't be in Long Beach tonight. Anyone want to do a crawl of the sushi places?" 
[23:51] <03Quaker> “Oh, I didn’t realize - Deacon, what a pleasure.” She takes his hand warmly - literally, since her Blush is still around. “I’ve always admired the Bishops and the work your Church does. You don’t need me to tell you, I try to make every service…though I haven’t seen you there, you must be busy elsewhere. You must be in the San Fernando parish, yes?” 
[23:51] <03tom> 14He takes her hand and, after a painfully slow moment shakes it gently. 
[23:52] <03tom> "Yeah, down in Mission Viejo."
[23:53] <03Quaker> The helicopter pilot doesn’t look sleepy, thankfully. Wilson is the only passenger in the small Bell. “Are you heading to an airstrip, sir? Or am I just letting you off somewhere?” 
[23:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Parking lot in Laguna Beach." 10He gives the pilot the address.
[23:54] <03Quaker> Hall is uncomprehending? “…is that in the Valley? Sorry, I have the worst sense of place.” 
[23:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What a weird fucking night.
[23:55] <03tom> 14Oh, right. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry- I'm with the uh, Carmelites."
[23:55] <03tom> 14Quickly changing the subject: "I'm here at Baron Laguna's request."
[23:56] <03Crion> 4Cav's smile maintains its fang. "You know how it is."
[23:57] <03Quaker> The helicopter rises into the night. Below, he can see Blythe watching from the edge of the helipad, and as they lift off higher and higher, he can see the light of the estate and its vast gardens shrink smaller and smaller, an island in the dark desert. 
[23:57] <03Quaker> Hall’s hand jerks out of Tommy’s, like she’s been bitten. “Oh.” 
[23:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Nice view.
[23:57] <03Quaker> “Well.” 
[23:57] <03Crion> 4And now she definitely knows how it is.
[23:58] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Let's get down to it then." 4He gestures to the conference room. "After you. Baroness."
Session Time: Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03tom> "Nice."
[00:00] <03Quaker> The Baroness smiles, her fangs extended as well. “I suppose things are different down here.” She looks Tommy up and down. “Yes, thank you.” She enters the conference room. Will they follow? 
[00:01] <03Crion> 4Indeed.
[00:01] <03Crion> 4Cav will step into the room, cup of coffee and saucer in hand, and set them down at the head of the table at the end closest to the door. Then he'll look up with that self-same smile. "Count Bren. How the hell are you?"
[00:02] <03tom> 14Tommy follows them in, silent but with a sanguine impression.
[00:03] <03Quaker> Wilson’s ride moves swiftly over the dark hills separating Lancaster from the rest of the County. Before he knows it, they’re banking left, past the glittering spires of downtown, headed towards the coast. 
[00:03] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Aren’t your friends down there?” 
01[00:05] <03banana> 6KJ: "How do you know that, Pearl?"
01[00:05] <03banana> "Nevermind. There's one guy I know, Cavanaugh. I warned him to get out."
01[00:05] <03banana> "He won't."
[00:06] <03Quaker> Two of the three in the conference room as Hall, Cav, and Tommy take their seats turn to look. Seated at the figure at the end of the table’s right is a young man with shoulder-length blonde hair, a nervous smile playing around on his features. At the figure’s left is a older man, fine scarring running across his nose and brow. His facial hair is combed into a neatly cropped beard and spike moustache. 
03[00:07] * Joins: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net)
01[00:07] <03banana> 6KJ's still got the blush of life about her, so the oddly perceptive Pearl Bernstein might detect a soul in conflict. Something like terror, actually, as if she's already gone out on a limb.
01[00:08] <03banana> 6Which is true, because if Bren wins tonight and Murray thinks that report was too-long delayed...
[00:08] <03Quaker> Dwarfing both, the Count of Long Beach stands at the far end of the table, unmoving, limbs hidden in his robe, features hidden behind a white porcelain mask. The mask, Cav notes, is smiling. The last time he saw Bren, in the whorl of combat at Bressi Ranch, it was frowning. 
[00:08] <03Quaker> “I am well, Baron. There is much we have to discuss.” 
[00:08] <03Quaker> “Hello, Deacon Saldana. Your presence is unexpected.” 
[00:09] <03Quaker> Pearl: “So what now?” 
[00:09] <03Quaker> Jessie bangs the table with her hand. “Are you just gonna leave him out to dry??” 
[00:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah. Yeah, we do."
[00:10] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Before we begin, as a courtesy, I'll note that Baron Wilson Frost of Hollywood will be joining us as well."
[00:10] <03Crion> "He is on his way here now."
[00:11] <03Crion> 4He takes a deep sip of his coffee. "Mmm. Good stuff."
[00:11] <03Crion> 4To the rest of the table: "There is coffee in the kitchenette. If you're Blushing."
[00:11] <03Quaker> Before Cav clarifies, the three people with Bren look around the room as if expecting him to fall out of the ceiling. At the mention of coffee, Hall gets up to get a cup. “Not like I was planning on sleeping…” 
02[00:12] * Quits: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:13] <03tom> 14The Deacon folds his hands on the table, shrugs. "A lot has been happening."
01[00:13] <03banana> 6KJ: "Are you- do you know what it would mean, to get in a fight with Bren? Or even to be the one stopping a fight he wants to have/"
[00:13] <03Quaker> Bren’s total lack of movement makes him hard to read. As does his lack of a face. “Hollywood to Laguna is quite the trip. You must be good friends. It was my understanding that Frost’s severe depression and guilt over his sire’s disgrace meant he kept to himself.” 
[00:14] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'm sure it was."
01[00:14] <03banana> "I don't have a sire whose best friend runs the Wilderness Commission, Jessie!"
[00:14] <03tom> "At the moment, I'm acting independent of Soria while we wait to confirm some facts and develop a position."
[00:14] <03Crion> 4Cav: "...No Cosmo Morgan tonight, I see. I do hope he's doing better."
[00:15] <03Quaker> Pearl: “Or a mother who’s Countess-Palatine. Or a cousin who’s a Marquise. Or a second cousin who-“ 
[00:16] <03Quaker> Jessie waves her hand. “What, are you going to hide behind other people forever? That’s how Bren got this big in the first place! Somebody outta cut him down to size.” 
[00:17] <03Quaker> Jessie realizes KJ’s position. “Oh, wait you work for Murray. Hmm…well, you should find a way to screw them both! And be able to live for yourself!” 
[00:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Cav gets a text. <5 minutes.>
[00:18] <03tom> 14Tommy gives Cav the same look he'd give to someone who starts conversations with strangers on public busses.
01[00:18] <03banana> 6KJ's nearly yelling: "I don't work for her anymore!"
01[00:19] <03banana> 6Pause, more quietly: "But, I don't think that would matter to her, so you're basically right, yeah."
[00:19] <03Quaker> Hall returns with a coffee and the saucer full of creamer cups, which she begins to pour one after the other. “No thanks to your friend, Deacon.” 
[00:20] <03Crion> 4Cav's voice loses a bit of its solicitous good-humor. "Morgan will shoulder his fair share of the blame for what happened on my territory, Baroness."
[00:20] <03Crion> "But I am given to understand, Count, that this is not the purpose of your visit tonight."
[00:20] <03Quaker> Frances, from her position of laying quietly on the booth’s cushions: “Why is it that all our elders weigh so heavily on us? I wish…” 
[00:21] <03Quaker> Jessie: “I mean, mine don’t, *my* mom is great, she-“ 
[00:21] <03Quaker> Frances throws a drink list at her. “Uggghhh!!!” 
01[00:22] <03banana> 6KJ: "It's not a bad thing to have a good.. mother. Someone had to."
[00:22] <03tom> 14The Church has always complied with the law, Baroness. We are still seaching for Souza, and things are... a bit weird right now."
[00:22] <03tom> "The Church has always complied with the law, Baroness. We are still seaching for Souza, and things are... a bit weird right now."
01[00:22] <03banana> "I mean."
01[00:23] <03banana> "If you guys want to form a.. posse, and all go down there and.. interfere, it's likely that we'd be able to run away if it came to that."
[00:23] <03Quaker> The scarred, moustached man looks like Cav has told a joke. “Share the blame? I don’t think he beat himself within an inch of his life.” 
[00:24] <03Crion> 4Cav's smile dips even further from his face. "We haven't been introduced."
[00:26] <03Quaker> Bren’s mask inclines slightly. “Baron Laguna, Baroness Hall of Lakewood, who you’ve already met. Baron Esparza, of Paramount,” indicating the young man with the long hair. “Baron Valens, of Artesia.” The scarred man bows his head, politely. 
01[00:27] <03banana> 6Of course they won't say yes. Why would they? Please don't say yes.
[00:27] <03Quaker> Pearl: “I don’t remember mine.” Frances: “I guess.” Jessie: “Yeah!! Look, you can share mine…” 
[00:27] <03tom> "The Church has always complied with the law, Baroness. We got Sponger, and we're sorta... rebuilding the events of the night."
[00:30] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Ah. Baron Valens. A pleasure. Morgan's lucky to live in Los Angeles, and have patrons such as your esteemed selves. Because if it were me, and this were Manhattan, Cosmo Morgan would already be dead."
[00:31] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But we take breaches of the Masquerade very, very seriously in Manhattan."
[00:31] <03tom> 14Tommy, sweating: "Yeah."
[00:31] <03Quaker> As Wilson’s helicopter flits down the PCH, the black and lightless ocean on one side and the thinly illuminated hills on the other, the pilot points down at the highway below. There’s a long column of ten or so black SUVs weaving effortlessly in and out of the traffic of other cars as they pass, so well-coordinated it almost appears to be one large vehicle. Forr a moment, it appears that they’re keeping pace with the helicopter, but 
[00:31] <03Quaker> that’s impossible, and Wilson’s ride soon leaves them behind. Still, though, they must have been pushing a hundred. 
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Jesus. Must be Sherman.
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh god, he'll have brought Augustin.
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Fuuuuuuuuck.
[00:33] <03Quaker> Bren: “And where is your proof that Morgan violated the Masquerade?” 
[00:36] <03Crion> 4Cav is purposefully vague. "We have testimony. An investigation is ongoing. Frankly, it's not an accusation I would entertain lightly, but given my past dealings with Morgan, I find it far too believable. With respect, your touch with that one has been very...light. He presumes much in your protection. It leads us to situations like this."
[00:36] <03Quaker> Jessie: “Yeah!! Let’s go down there. I want to see the werewolf for once.” 
[00:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's the sound of a helicopter outside the S&C offices.
[00:39] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And given that the testimony concerns certain...prejudices against a sect of our fellow Kindreds in the Sanctum that I have seen reflected throughout our organization, I find it believable in that regard as well. Withholding, of course, any judgment on that prejudice's validity."
[00:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What's this place like? Are there guards out front? Any sign of what's going on inside?
[00:40] <03Crion> 4Cav's already sensing Hollywood in the air. And there's this...feeling...
[00:40] <03Crion> 4Like a rheumatic knee before a storm...
[00:40] <03Crion> 4Cav hasn't posted guards. It looks like a small, non-descript one-story office, part of a larger complex and the only one open at the moment.
[00:41] <03Crion> 4That said, the lights out front are still muted.
01[00:41] <03banana> 6KJ: "My car's outside, but if the thing in the video I sent you is a werewolf I don't wanna see another one." 
[00:41] <03Crion> "That would be Baron Hollywood," 4he says as the helicopter becomes audible.
[00:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's just to discourage the trick or treaters, probably. Wilson'll let himself in. Probably not anyone to lead him to the office or a blood trail to follow but this place isn't that big.
[00:42] <03Quaker> Bren: “I am pleased to see that you take your responsibilities seriously, Baron. It reflects well on you. If you insist that it was that way, then you must certainly have a good reason. I am sure that the Judex will rule fairly.” Bren’s party looks up at the sudden noise. Bren does not. 
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But putting the mere facts of the case aside, that issue is now up to our legal system to sort out. I, of course, will be offering all such testimony as is required, given that I am responsible for the territory in which the crime was committed."
[00:44] <03Quaker> Bren: “I did not come here to discuss the case. In either case, it is out of both of our hands.” 
01[00:44] <03banana> 6Jessie's confident enough for anything. KJ's mostly watching Pearl, here, nervous about whether Baron Redondo Beach's obvious trauma wins out over what seems to be a bad case of actually being a nice person.
[00:44] <03Crion> "Mmm." 4Another sip of coffee. God, replacing this office is going to be a headache.
01[00:44] <03banana> 6No fucking what would be better, here. How about if they DO head down to Laguna, but too late to get involved? So they could say they tried.
01[00:44] <03banana> *6No fucking idea
[00:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson walks in, then. "Evening! Baron, Baron, Baron, Baroness, Count."
[00:46] <03Crion> 4Cav stands to shake Wilson's hand. "Baron Hollywood! There's coffee on in the kitchenette, if you wish. The Count and I were merely finding accord over a minor legal matter."
[00:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He shakes Cav's hand and then pulls out a chair to sit next to Tommy. "Deacon."
[00:47] <03Quaker> Bren: “Good evening, Baron Hollywood. Baron Laguna, forgive my rudeness. I did not mean to argue with you over something as minor as that. I have not visited you since your elevation. My friends and I thought that we should correct that mild slight.” 
[00:47] <03tom> "Good to see you, Hollywood."
[00:48] <03tom> 14He steeples his folded hands on the table and smirks toward the masked man.
[00:48] <03Crion> 4Cav: "The rudeness is partly my own, Count. I have had my hands full with my new obligations. The barony of Laguna presents some...unique challenges, geographically."
[00:48] <03Quaker> Pearl: “…I think that if your friens are down there, the more of us that are there, the better. In case something bad happens.” 
[00:48] <03Crion> 4Gerrymandered border-patrol-ass assignment.
[00:50] <03Quaker> Bren: “And some uniquely beautiful views. I cannot imagine that Sacramento or New York City would compare. Coney Island seems…less appealing than our own shore.” 
[00:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's a lot nicer than the rest of Brooklyn, though."
[00:51] <03Crion> 4Cav smiles thinly. "The only benefit to being Kindred in New York City is you no longer have to look at it during the day. Night makes it seem far prettier."
[00:51] <03Crion> "Distance makes it prettier still."
01[00:53] <03banana> 6Friends. KJ moistens her lips with her tongue- why does the simulacrum of life last so long, anyway? Wouldn't it be better to be immutable? Like the functional programming people go on about, ha ha. Ah, fuck.
01[00:53] <03banana>  6She spills it: "I actually barely know the guy. But Donald Bren is- he's got something over me too, not just Frances. I want to be there to have some power over what happens. Might get to stop being scared
[00:53] <03Quaker> Bren: “I have never visited it. Its reputation precedes it, though. Oh, I’ve forgotten some things I’ve brought for you….” 
01[00:53] <03banana> "
[00:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This is the part Wilson doesn't like about Donald Bren. Like, sure, terrifying sociopath with vast personal and political power, but on top of that the way he talks is infectious. We stay in this room long enough and we'll all be waist deep in some Downton Abbey shit.
[00:53] <03Quaker> “Oscar…” Baron Esparza leans under the table, looking for something. 
01[00:54] <03banana> 6So, she stands up, takes a step over to the broken table. "There's nobody to save as far as I know. Still in?"
[00:54] <03tom> 14Tommy tenses up. If there's gonna be anything horribly fucked up that happens, it'll be now that it does.
[00:55] <03Quaker> Esparza comes up with a large metal case. Putting it on the table, he unclasps the first of several locks. 
[00:56] <03Quaker> Jessie leaps up, then falls back into the booth. “Yeah-uhf-“ 
[00:56] <03Quaker> Pearl: “If you want me to come, then I’ll come.” 
[00:56] <03Quaker> Frances: “I guess I should, um…explain myself in person…” 
01[00:57] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'd like you to." 6To Frances: "Get out from under some of the weight, yeah?"
[00:57] <03Quaker> The Baron Paramount leaves the last lock for Cav, sliding it slowly across the table. 
[00:58] <03Crion> 4Well.
[00:58] <03Quaker> Bren: “For you.” 
[00:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 106:5 against it being a bomb or body part.
[01:00] <03Crion> 4Cav reaches out his senses. Has a posse of Kindred ridden into his territory yet?
[01:00] <03Quaker> They have not. 
[01:01] <03Crion> 4No time like the present. Smoothly, Cav pops the final lock and opens the case, eyes remaining on Bren rather than looking down into the contents of...whatever this is.
[01:01] <03Crion> 4If it hasn't exploded or impaled him in the chest after a second or two, then he'll look down.
[01:02] <03Quaker> Pearl checks her phone. “The seneschal knows what’s up. I guess we’ll have to trust her to come up with something. Poor Rosa, right before we all leave for Santa Barbara. Hey, K.J., are you going this year? Or are you still waiting for an invitation…” 
01[01:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "Well. Let's go be fashionably late." 6When your friend owns the club you don't have to pay on the way out, right?
01[01:03] <03banana> "I got mailed a rifle by a secret admirer, that probably counts."
[01:04] <03Quaker> The metal case parts with a click, the last lock giving way…and Cav finds himself staring down at a work of exquisite craftsmanship and genius…perfect lines…unbelievable icing…strawberries of an almost painfully perfect deep red…superb proportions…
[01:04] <03Quaker> The room is silent while Cav looks at the cake. 
[01:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson covers his mouth.
[01:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He looks very serious.
[01:05] <03Quaker> Then Conestoga informs him that twenty kindred have entered the city’s limits, traveling very quickly. 
[01:05] <03Quaker> Bren: “Go on.” 
[01:06] <03Crion> 4Smoothly, without any betrayal of surprise at either the cake or the Kindred, he looks back up at Bren. "Why thank you. I think I will. A moment while I get plates."
[01:06] <03Quaker> Bren: “Of course.” 
[01:07] <03Crion> 4Clinton makes it into the hallway and down to the kitchenette before beginning to shake his head and silently laugh.
[01:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To the room while Cavanaugh's outside: "How's everyone doing tonight?"
[01:08] <03Crion> 4He will get four plates, four forks, and four knives. That should be sufficient. He will also wait.
[01:08] <03Quaker> When he leaves, Bren’s solid form ripples slightly, and in front of Tommy and Wilson a large easel appears. Then, plucked from nothing, a large oil portrait of Cav appears on it. Hall starts to pull several manila folders out and arrange them on the table, while Esparza sorts glossy brochures with pictures of different resorts and apartment buildings on them. 
[01:09] <03Quaker> Esparza nods. “Can’t complain. How’re you doing, Wilson?” 
[01:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not bad, not bad. Weird night. Been having a lot of those lately."
[01:10] <03Quaker> Cav waits long enough for the giant line of high-speed kindred to end up in his office parking lot. He doesn’t need Conestoga to hear engines shut off and doors slam. 
[01:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So the cake was just to soften him up for the timeshare pitch, huh?"
01[01:11] <03banana> 6Probably the main thing about this fun trip down the coast is going to be who gets to control the radio.
[01:11] <03Quaker> Bren: “How’s Laura doing? Oh, right.” 
[01:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What on earth did you do to piss off Sherman Ma?"
[01:14] <03Quaker> Bren: “Why?” 
[01:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Raced about ten Explorers on the way here."
[01:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They're probably pulling in by now."
[01:15] <03tom> 14Deacon Saldana Gulps comically.
[01:15] <03Quaker> Bren: “The man is a sore loser.” 
[01:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Who among us?"
[01:15] <03Crion> 4Cav will begin to meander his way back to the conference room.
[01:16] <03Quaker> He’ll be greeted by the second present, and what appears to be the beginning of some sort of presentation. 
[01:16] <03Crion> 4He'll set the plates down. "Count Bren."
[01:16] <03Crion> "Are you expecting further company?"
[01:17] <03Quaker> Bren: “Also for you, Baron. Compliments of my territory. I commissioned Munoz himself. I am not, although Baron Frost told me that Count Ma and several others seem to be looking for me.” 
[01:17] <03Crion> "That is an excellent likeness, I must admit."
[01:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't know if we have enough cake for the entire Wilderness Commission..."
[01:18] <03Crion> 4Cav nods sagely. "That would explain the twenty-odd Kindred who have just arrived."
[01:18] <03Crion> "I take it I won't be needing to fetch more plates." 4Cav says this as he cuts himself a slice of cake.
[01:20] <03Quaker> Bren: “It’s yours to share as you like.” 
[01:20] <03tom> 14Tommy is now pretty sure he's going to spend the rest of the night getting his nuts tazed, so cake would be good right now. 
[01:21] <03Quaker> It tastes incredible, actually. It’s really, really good. 
[01:21] <03Quaker> The twenty kindred seem to be making their way into the building. 
[01:22] <03tom> 14Tommy puts down the fork, chews, sighs. He gestures at Bren with the fork. "So it's people, right?"
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson clears his throat.
[01:23] <03tom> 14He stabs another spongy chunk of cake and chews thoughtfully.
[01:23] <03Quaker> Bren: “Eggs. And butter. Sugar, too. What normally constitutes a cake.” 
[01:23] <03Crion> 4Cav moves to the door and begins to eat his slice of cake. "I suspect we'll have to continue this another time, Count."
[01:23] <03Crion> 4Cav: "If possible."
[01:24] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Perhaps after I've picked out a new office."
[01:24] <03Quaker> Bren: “Are you expecting something to happen to this one?” 
[01:26] <03Crion> 4Cav: "The carpet here is too difficult to clean." 4He'll step out into the hallway. Have Ma and his legions made it into the office proper?
[01:27] <03Quaker> Jessie’s driving is enthusiastically reckless, but there’s not much traffic and she makes excellent time. KJ and Co. arrive in the office parking lot. They can see 10 SUVs parked in a circle, a pair of masked and outfitted guards watching over them. The guns they’re carrying seem very big, and very serious. Much like the one she received in the mail, actually. 
01[01:29] <03banana> 6That gun is of course locked up in a safe somewhere with like, one trusted ghoul who has the key to get it out for googling purposes. Thank goodness.
[01:29] <03Quaker> They have. Cav must recognize Sherman Ma from the ballet and other functions, although he seemd to be almost emotionless compared to the extremely angry person Cav meets coming up the stairs. Also, he wasn’t wearing full plate, embedded with rubies and fine red scrollwork, or carrying a greatsword. His dark skin is flushed red for good measure. 
[01:30] <03tom> 14Tommy tears into another piece of cake. "Thish ish so fucking good."
[01:30] <03Crion> 4Cav leans against a desk well out of Ma's path to the conference room and forks another piece of cake. "Count Ma. A pleasure."
[01:31] <03Crion> 4He'll eat the piece of cake, and point to the conference room door with his fork.
[01:32] <03Quaker> Behind him, nearly twenty kindred in serious military equipment, holding serious military guns, march behind. They’re all masked and equipped with strange-looking goggles. The only one who isn’t is a man with a full, dark blonde beard. 
[01:32] <03Crion> 4Cav know him?
01[01:33] <03banana> 6KJ knows those cars. Last time she was in one she met Baron Hollywood. Wonder what he's doing tonight? 
[01:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sherman's armor is so nice. Wilson should get a suit like that.
[01:34] <03Quaker> They haven’t been introduced. “Is Bren in there?” The bearded one nods at the conference room. 
[01:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Tommy: "Deacon, could I have a word outside?"
01[01:35] <03banana> 6She's getting out, anyway, in her stupid club dress (except: it worked! not so stupid). Approaching the guards: "Baron Anaheim. May we please enter, to keep watch?"
[01:36] <03Crion> 4Cav: "We haven't been introduced. I'm Clinton Cavanaugh. This is my barony.
[01:36] <03Crion> "
[01:37] <03Crion> "You're interrupting a very compelling pitch for a reverse-mortgage and some excellent cake."
[01:37] <03tom> 14Tommy gets up, shaking slightly. "Let's go."
[01:37] <03Quaker> The guard she talks to says something muffled, then reaches for his mask. “Oh, H-h-hi, Baron Valentine. I-i-it’s me, Baron Y-Y-Y…Wesley Fitzroy. What are you doing here?” 
01[01:38] <03banana> 6Wesley! "Wesley!"
[01:38] <03tom> 14'Holy shit', the nosferatu mouths as he slinks out of the room.
[01:38] <03Quaker> Bren sighs. “Of all the stupid things…” 
[01:38] <03Crion> 4Did he bring the cake?
[01:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll hold the door open for Tommy. "Figure we're not doing anyone any favors getting lit up while looking at a real estate pitch."
[01:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How's the cake?"
01[01:39] <03banana> "Hey, it's nice to see you- we're still on tomorrow night, but I. Wanted to come make sure that there's, you know, a tomorrow night."
[01:39] <03Crion> 4In all honesty Cav's sort of irritated at himself for even slowing Ma down like this; if Bren wanted to, he could abscond out the window.
[01:39] <03Crion> 4But this is his office, goddammit, and besides, Bren doesn't seem the absconding type.
[01:40] <03Quaker> The bearded one nods, and doesn’t hold out his hand. “Augustine Garcia. Is Count Bren inside that conference room?” 
[01:41] <03Quaker> Wesley: “I’m not really sure what’s going on, to be honest.” 
[01:41] <03tom> 14He's wiping frosting off his cheek with his thumb. "It's really good, dude."
[01:42] <03tom> 14He leans up against the wall and turns his face away from any onlookers before he speaks: "So uh... do you guys.."
[01:42] <03Crion> 4Cav shakes his head and returns to his cake. "Yes, along with Baroness Lakewood, Baron Paramount, and Baron Artesia."
[01:43] <03Quaker> The men fan out in a circle, aiming their guns at the frosted glass and the shapes beyond. 
[01:43] <03Crion> "Bren did not request my permission before entering. So I hardly have precedent to stand on ceremony and ask for Count Ma's."
01[01:44] <03banana> 6Valentine: "Comeuppances. But there's someone else coming. There, a helicopter!" 6She points sharply into the sky.
[01:45] <03Quaker> Count Ma: “You entertained this…animal? With…” He looks at the cake, and another paroxysm of rage passes over him. “Augustine, with me. Now!” 
[01:45] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh, coldly: "I fulfilled my social obligations. Count."
[01:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's standing between Sherman and the door.
01[01:49] <03banana> 6There really is a helicopter. But if anyone looks back where KJ was, there's nobody there, and surely there never was.
[01:50] <03Quaker> The cabinets next to Cav’s head explode as the greatsword swings through them like a man swishing a twig. “Don’t think you’ve earned the right to address me, Cavanaugh. You and Bren…making…deals…in your backrooms. I know what you people are like.” Cav can feel the heat of his blood. “You…new people. You think the Prince’s favor is a skirt you can hide behind. And now your kind has ensnared my childe in another of your
[01:50] <03Quaker> schemes. You…graspers. Get out of here, Baron.” Cav has to admit, he’s never heard the word pronounced with so much poisonous sarcasm. Ma moves to the door. “GET OUT THE WAY, FROST.” 
[01:50] <03Quaker> Frances looks around. “Hey…” 
01[01:50] <03banana> 6'Standards and Compliance'? That's a weird thing to have over your Barony offices. KJ takes a photo of it as she heads in, out of habit and because the framing is good.
[01:51] <03Crion> 4Cav merely glares at him and eats cake.
[01:51] <03Crion> 4No one is throwing him out of his own damn office.
01[01:51] <03banana> 6She might be able to forgive herself if Frances or Pearl or Jessie got hurt, but, it would better not to find out.
[01:52] <03Quaker> The guns swing from the frosted glass to Frost the Baron. 
[01:53] <03Quaker> Augustine, gently. “Move, Wilson.” 
[01:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson holds his hands up but his expression is placid. "I don't really care if you kill Bren. But God, Sherman, I don't want to live through another civil war."
[01:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Do you?"
[01:59] <03Quaker> Count Ma: “It’s through peace that scum like this get fat with power, Wilson. Wrap their fingers around the throats of the ones dear to us. How many of us have seen their proteges slip through to his little web of…- he spits the words - “interest. Commerce. Investment. Until they forget who they are, who their sires are. Do you really want him instead of the Prince, Wilson? That’s what he wants. That’s what peace means. Our 
[02:00] <03Quaker> hands tied behind our back while he persuades us to give him everything we have. Get out of the way, Wilson. He’s a traitor and a cancer.” 
[02:01] <03Crion> 4All fair points.
[02:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I agree with all of that. Still."
[02:03] <03Quaker> Here’s something new for Cav: another trio of Kindred pop onto his radar, about a hundred feet in the air and going even faster than the cars did. Then, once they reach the space just above the parking lot, two of the kindred seem to slow all the way down, and head…straight down. 
[02:03] <03Quaker> Since they’re all inside, all KJ hears is a metallic crunch and crash. 
[02:03] <03Crion> 4Cav finishes the cake. "Company on the roof."
[02:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He should've stayed with Blythe.
[02:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Oh, good. Mariangel's here to add a voice of reason."
[02:07] <03Quaker> Count Ma: “I’m going to get rid of this spider before he takes my childe away from me. Wilson, I’m going to give you five seconds to move.” 
[02:08] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I'd do it if I were you, Baron Hollywood."
[02:08] <03Crion> "I can replace the doors and the windows."
[02:10] <03Quaker> Outside, KJ hears voices, then shouting, then lowered voices again, then the doors open footsteps, and Mariangel Figueroa and Valeria Lewis stand in armor in the corridor, trailed meekly by Fitzroy, Frances, Jessie, and Pearl. 
01[02:11] <03banana> 6Baron Frost might or might not have moved, but a slim figure in a black dress comes out of fucking nowhere and tackles him to the ground, away from the frosted glass entirely.
[02:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Jeez.
[02:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Women just can't keep their hands off him tonight.
01[02:11] <03banana> "It's not the time to make nice!", 6she hisses urgently, basically kneeling on his chest.
[02:12] <03Quaker> Valeria Lewis’s low voice seems to cut through everything. “All Barons not a guest of the master of this territory are to leave. Now.” 
[02:13] <03Quaker> Count Ma nods at Garcia, and the 20 men cock their rifles and point them at the door. 
[02:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wh-" 10Wilson's on his back, with KJ on his chest. "Baron Valentine. Nice to see you."

[08:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12 __-----_________________{]__________________________________________________
[08:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12{&&&&&&&#%%&#%&%&%&%&%#%&|]__________________________________________________\
[08:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12                         {]
[08:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's night time in the Daylit Court. The place does live up to its name, though; as late as it gets, the sky never quite loses the rosy blush of distant sunset. Somehow, this doesn't stop the stars from shining clearly down from the sky directly above the castle.
[08:13] <03Crion> 4As the Unconquered Sun appearing to linger in these lands is a fully cosmetic effect, Ir doesn't take much solace in it.
[08:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir and Tatsuya are both part of the ongoing festivities, and both blending in in their own ways. Dressed up outlandishly, Ir's part of the retinue of one Lady Rajienza, marched into the grand hall alongside acrobats, jugglers, trained bears, and the like. Meanwhile, Tatsuya's completely out of sight, at times shuffling unseen between courtiers and at other times clinging to the sides 
[08:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12of pillars or sidling behind pieces of furniture.
[08:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12Here's what Ir and Tatsuya pick up, from the chatter: the foul depredations of the Nightwreathed Court continue apace, corrupting the mountains and abducting or consuming their innocent denizens. It's only possible or practical for the daylit knights to defend or rescue so many people at once, so everyone's got their hopes pinned on the efforts of the Hero.
[08:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12As well, grim tidings of some sort have darkened the mood of old sage Xalvierre... knight-captain Corazelle has imposed structure on the knights, but everything seems tense... high priest Narvithex is always at the old king's ear...
[08:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Actually, that kind of thing is often repeated in those exact words by one courtier to another, sometimes passing between the same two people for the second time in a matter of minutes. The impression you get is that there are maybe five or six self-willed beings in the room, discounting yourselves and the two mortals present - one a flautist in Miaja's orchestra, the other an old 
[08:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12and tired-looking butler.
[08:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Formal performances and so on are due to start soon, so if there's anywhere you want to sneak off to, anyone you want to conspire with or interview, or whatever, now's the time.
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile, Blossom and Eikichi have just thundered into a wide hall that House Cathak has been excavating under the Hedgehog mountain range. They're here to destroy or at least steal the Earth-Shaping Stone that allows the mining to proceed as quickly as it has, but said stone's just been picked up and pocketed by a huge, armor-clad Dragon-Blood hefting what looks like a gigantic 
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12smith's hammer. Beside him, Cathak Kalza is sheating her reaper daiklave dramatically at her side and settling into a combat stance. Around both are a contingent of guards, and some miners who are huddling at the corners of the room.
[08:24] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's comfortably in position in case things go awry. There's not that much he needs to know, either - win the humans back or take them by force, then this place gets reshaped soon anyway.
[08:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Not even enough setup for a team monologue. Ugh.
[08:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi tosses his hair impatiently.
[08:25] <03Crion> 4The only person Ir might benefit from a strategy session with is Tatsuya himself, and he'll have to instigate that one.
[08:34] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's currently hiding behind a pillar, though he keeps shifting and putting his hands in his pockets. Something seems to trouble him.
[08:36] <03Crion> 4It's rather easy to find him.
[08:36] <03Crion> 4...Well, no it isn't.
[08:38] <03Crion> 4But, it's a lot easier than it would be if you didn't already know where to look. She still needs to wander the edge of the room to just the right angle and then actually walk forward out onto the dance floor to make sure it's him. Luckily the dancers themselves have clockwork precision, and she times it not to get in anyone's way.
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's some dancing, some gossip, some feasting - although, if you pay attention, none of the actual lords and ladies in attention eat anything substantive. All throughout, the court orchestra plays background music, the twelve foot tall green woman who controls it lounging and sometimes outright sleeping in its vicinity. Then, Ir's... sponsor? Keeper? Steps forward to address the 
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12circle of fae around the throne.
[08:40] <03@Ferrinus> "I've a new one - a great one. She can match our guest, I've no doubt." 12This appears to rouse Miaja from her nap, while at the same time the king and a variety of nobles mutter gravely to themselves and each other.
[08:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ir finds herself being pushed and prodded to the edge of the faerie orchestra, where she finds herself staring at a motley of seeming humans and plant-creatures, behind all of whom a green woman lounges like a tiger on a broad dais. Green woman ("Miaja"): "Then... you'll no longer wish my-" "Quite the contrary! You might have more to learn."
[08:43] <03Crion> 4Ir's tetchy enough just about being here that the pushes and prods better take the hint when she moves in the right direction.
[08:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Miaja eyes Ir. "So... visitor. You're a musician?"
[08:46] <03Crion> "I'm lots of things." 4Ir snaps out her arm and extends her wrist up, fingers arched as if holding the neck of an imaginary fiddle, and Iscariot slithers across her bare shoulders to gather in just the shape they're waiting for. "Musician's one."
[08:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Miaja's eyes light up. "And a magician! Where did you get it."
[08:50] <03Crion> "The end of another world." 4Poetically true, especially in the Pneuman tradition with regards to the First Age. "It's a key. I just keep finding different locks."
[08:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12This appears to delight and amaze pretty much Ir's entire audience; the faeries gasp or titter to themselves or even coo like children. Miaja, for her part, just stares with glittering eyes. "Oh. Ohhh that's lovely. But... it's older than you, I think. And so am I."
[08:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's right hand rises and his anima spreads out like fanning wings, blue-gold light framing a barrage of obsidian that clatters off the Dynasts' armor, leaving them unharmed.
[08:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They're not gonna want to turn around.
[08:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Miaja: "And you're just one pair of hands, in the end. Can you do this?" 12Her entire orchestra moves as one.
[08:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Meanwhile---
[08:59] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yeah. Reason for that is, I'm mortal. Y'all, well...Y'all come from circumstances."
[09:00] <03Crion> "Funny thing about that. I look around and I'm not the only one."
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Essence flares in the Cathak mines. A formation of soldiers goes charging forward, imbued with Cathak Zoltet's inspiring flames, only to be cut down near-instantly by a hail of sorcery. Cathak Kalza, blazing like a comet, charges into the Solar ranks like a woman possessed, but blow after blow is parried or dodged depending on its target.
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12Miaja's orchestra plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRWq53IFXVQ
[09:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's a jaunty tune that puts one in mind of warm breezes and sandy shores. It's literally enchanting, but Ir and Tatsuya both get the idea that the sorcerous, addictive properties of the music currently sliding off them like water would off a duck aren't even intentional - the green fairy's just that enthusiastic.
[09:23] <03dammitwho> 7Hrmph! Pitiful.
[09:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12The pale woman playing a flute at the edge of the orchestra can barely keep up with the goblins and wood sprites, and it's impossible to ignore the few sour notes she issues, but Miaja merely looks upon her with a patient, magnanimous pity.
[09:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eventually, the song concludes, and two by two the eyes of the court turn to Ir. Miaja's certainly do. Her expression says: show me what you got.
[09:33] <03trenchfoot> 6Hmph. Tatsuya watches from the rafters, looming over everything like some kind of phantom. He's still wary of anything moving against Ir, despite the relaxed mood... Miaja's good.
03[09:40] * banana|peels is now known as banana
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi holds the Linchpin back like a scorpion's tail, and the sorcerer's anima tinges green and white. After a moment, his eyes and Kalza's burn the same, and Kalza staggers.
[09:48] <03trenchfoot> 6...Ir's better.
[09:52] <03Crion> 4Ir listens, takes the mood in of the song, notes that the flautist's bit doesn't really play -- probably because it's bullshit she's here at all -- and realizes that even if most of these aren't really people in the strictest sense, they're trapped in a martial paradigm that's contradicted by them not being able to do shit. So let's work that into the idea of going home.
[09:52] <03Crion> "This is an old song, from far away. But it's about being home, and being willing to fight for that."
[09:53] <03Crion> 4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmnJ1FZv9ZU
[09:54] <03Crion> 4Ir's turn at the stage is loud, grinning, and swaggering in tone: an intentional provocation. She's not looking to start a fight, per se, but she is trying to get peoples' blood racing. For the mortals here that seems to be a serious problem.
[09:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Feet tap. Ears twitch. The nobles of the Daylit Court wake up a little, as late as it is; the old, weary king is rubbing at his eyes, the high priest at his side is looking jumpy, the knight-captain is pacing back and forth like a caged beast. Miaja's perched on her stand like a gargoyle now, eyeing Ir almost hungrily, and when the song concludes the room bursts into riotous applause 
[09:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12and cheering.
[09:59] <03@Ferrinus> "Ah... eh... exc-excellent! Oh, my, yes. Love... lovely...!" 12That's the king, who's not actualy raised his voice to be heard by the entire court for the entire night. His attending priest makes soothing motions at him, and the princess sitting nearby, clad almost entirely in white veils, raises a long finger to her chin in a gesture of growing intrigue. Soon, she's leaning over to 
[09:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12whisper to the monarch, and though what actually passes between them i obscured by a round of congratulations for the raksha lady who brought Ir to the court in the first place, pretty soon an elfin majordomo is tugging at one of Ir's sleeves.
[10:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12The princess would like to meet her, it seems.
[10:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elsewhere, a storm of crashing swords and burning hammers are just rebounding one after the other off Spite's Linchpin. There's a real madness in Kalza's eyes - she knows what Eikichi did to her memories, and she's going to exact a price for it come hell or high water.
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's eyes flash too, and unlike the swordmaster or the general, his attack hits home. Looks like it was Hell that came.
[10:12] <03Crion> 4That's no real surprise. That is how it usually goes in the stories.
[10:13] <03Crion> 4Ir will bid Iscariot return to its decorative form -- she makes it look nice, since she's pretty certain not all of that hunger in Miaja's eyes was for her alone -- and accept the summons.
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, Ir doesn't have to play along, strictly speaking. If she wants to, though, she's ushered to a balcony adjoining but not actually directly open to the main hall. She walks past a pair of guards who uncross and re-cross their halberds mechanically to find herself staring besides Naeva, who's a tall, spare figure so completely enfolded by white robes and veils that the only features 
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12of hers that can be made out at the moment are the long, indigo-hued fingers with which she clutches the balcony railing.
[10:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "You've... you're different. Where do you come from. Not the mountains?"
[10:17] <03Crion> 4Guessing this one's no mortal either.
[10:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Oh, no, Naeva's almost certainly a full-fledged Raksha. Does Tatsuya move to monitor the meeting, incidentally, or does he have other priorities in the court?
[10:18] <03trenchfoot> 6He'll stick close. Separating Ir could be a ploy, though it didn't seem like one... but it never hurts to be careful.
[10:28] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Not from the mountains. Not from the seas beyond them, either, but that's closer."
[10:28] <03Crion> "You've met my people before. You will again."
[10:29] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom sweeps through a few katas and makes a mystic gesture, flinging dozens of molten bolts through the air towards the Dragonblooded! Kalza is overcome by the terrible heat, and Zoltet's clothing and pouches rip and melt as a glowing hot jewel falls out and bounces to the ground!
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "Were you - were you made by someone else?"
[10:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12No scion of House Cathak expects to go out like Kalza just did. And yet, there she goes, screaming and collapsing into ash and carbon. Zoltet recoils as the Earth-Shaping Jewel falls away from him, and Eikichi can tell that its tenuously-maintained geomantic aura's just collapsed around it.
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "HA! Now the Pylon is ours alone!"
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Zoltet: "You... you!!" 12In the distance, you can hear the press of boots - the soldiers guarding the outside of the mine are going to reach you soon! Beside the ruins of Kalza's armor, the Dragon-Blood's reaper daiklave has somehow found its sheath, and lies pristine on the stone of the floor.
[10:35] <03dammitwho> "Pass unscathed to the yellow springs!" 7Blossom gestures again, and a small mote of fire leaps from her hand to the slain Dragonblood. The blue flames quickly spread, devouring the body but, curiously, leaving her personal effects intact.
[10:37] <03Crion> 4Gods, the shy stammering. Ir supposes it fits the aesthetic if your main goal is to convince guys whose balls just dropped to run around the countryside killing things to try and save you from boredom.
[10:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That sword... what was it whispering to her...?
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Dude, I'm right here.
[10:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wouldn't you like to know? ...you know, it'd probably be easy to find out.
[10:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Most people are."
[10:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "No, no. I mean besides... you know. Besides the Makers. You know the stories, right?"
[10:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya's hiding on the castle wall, exposed to the night air. From up here, he can easily watch and eavesdrop on the discussion between Ir and Naeva. His attention, though, is caught by something else - something even higher up on the wall.
[10:43] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Some of them. You never really know them all. I know where I think justice lives now, and that's enough for me."
[10:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya can see a dark figure with too-long limbs crawling lizardlike down the castle wall. They're clad in black and don't seem to be armed, but they HAVE got long black claws issuing from both their hands and feet. At this rate, it'll probably reach Ir and Naeva in another minute.
[10:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "Oh...well, I mean the one everyone knows. You know, how the makers used all their strength and tried and tried and that's how they got... dirt and rock and water and dust."
[10:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "Then they took the clay, and they made little humans out of the clay, to see if they could."
[10:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "But clay couldn't play so beautifully!"
[10:49] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya whistles a specific bird call before moving to intercept. Something along the lines of "potential problem," was the signal they'd set. 
[10:50] <03Crion> 4Iscariot silently slithers into a bunch of seeming-ring bangles that are actually connected.
[10:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Get the sword! It's possessed."
[10:55] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Perhaps not, but that's not the clay's fault."

[10:57] <03trenchfoot> 6He moves quickly but quietly towards the intruder, hoping to ambush the guy before he performs his nefarious deeds. There's not many other reasons to be up here, after all.
[10:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya climbs higher, avoiding sight-lines perfectly... but unlike the guards and other denizens of the daylit court, this guy's got a hunting animal's sense of smell, and Tatsuya doesn't do enough to remain downwind.
[10:58] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom dives! She somersaults past the fallen hearthstone, grabbing it an instant before the massive Dragonblood can! There's a hissing noise and smoke rises from her clenched fist as she holds the still-red-hot gem in her bare hand. "Eikichi! Do it NOW!"
[10:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12One figure climbing up, the other climbing down, the pair of sneaks finds itself facing off on either side of a small parapet. They exchange a stare... and then the stranger hisses and pounces!
[11:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "Are you just here to play for us?"
[11:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods and the air begins to ripple.

[11:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You saw the flautist."
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Naeva: "They say... they say that they're only safe up here." 12She gestures out at the night landscape before her. "That down there, monsters, the night court... you know."

[22:19] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnx5J8pKxfU
[22:24] <03Quaker> In the silence between the cocking of twenty rifles and whatever they were planning on doing next, the Archon Valeria Lewis, bodyguard to the Prince of Los Angeles, repeats herself. “By the order of Prince Bailey, Baron Cavanaugh is to decide who is an honored guest in his territory and who is not. All those told to leave, who don’t, are guilty of treason and will suffer accordingly.” Her strained voice is backed up by her terrible red 
[22:24] <03Quaker> claws, and the silent shape of the Marquise Figueroa, whose greatsword is making a mess of the carpet. 
[22:25] <03Quaker> Sherman Ma looks away from the door. “Why isn’t the Prince here to enforce his own law?” 
[22:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's trying to figure out whether he regrets coming. Hard to say yet. Hard to say.
[22:26] <03Quaker> Out of the corner of her eye, KJ can see Jessie and Pearl slip out, down the stairs. 
[22:27] <03Crion> 4If the Prince was to pop on down to the barony everytime the insane men he's permitted to become counts lose their minds at each other, he'd have no need for an archon, Cav doesn't say.
01[22:27] <03banana> 6Well that's good. KJ looks over at Cavanaugh. She has no idea whether she's welcome, to be honest? Or what she's hoping to happen here at this point.
01[22:28] <03banana> 6Five minutes ago it would've been simple: try to sow enough chaos from the shadows that Bren really ends up threatened, insofar as that's possible without drawing notice. Seems like it might not be on the table anymore.
[22:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The goal is to see that the fewest new blood vendettas possible are sworn tonight. We might stay in the single digits.
[22:29] <03Quaker> Ma might be asking a more pointed question than he thought. Wilson and Cav can see Lewis’s frown deepen. 
[22:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Bailey mentioned to Wilson and Blythe that he was going to pull back for a while...
01[22:34] <03banana> 6..speaking of which, KJ moves from her kneeling position into a crouch. To Frost, quietly: "Sorry about that. Things looked dicey!"
01[22:34] <03banana> "I'm sure you know the Commission well, but it's a lot of rifles."
[22:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson just shrugs without moving his shoulders. He's got a very expressive face.
[22:36] <03Crion> 4Cav finishes his cake and puts down the plate. "Mmm. Fantastic. So."
[22:38] <03Crion> "Is that Baron Anaheim I see over there, with Baron Hollywood?"
01[22:39] <03banana> 6KJ:  "Good evening, milord of Laguna."
[22:40] <03Crion> "It is, isn't it? I believe there's still some cake left in the conference room, if you're partial. Baron Anaheim stays."
01[22:41] <03banana> "Thanks!" 6KJ's kind of impressed by how long this guy is making Ma and Figueroa wait. That's chutzpah.
[22:42] <03Crion> "Baron Hollywood stays. Baron Garden Grove stays, and in the interest of fairness, oh, Baron Lakewood stays. Deacon Saldana stays as well, because I have business with him that was interrupted, and I don't intend to waste any more of his time than absolutely necessary with...this."
01[22:42] <03banana> 6Speaking of whom, she's keeping an eye on all three visible elders, to see if any of them are furious about all these people being invited to hang around.
[22:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They brought the man a damn cake. This moment is his by right.
[22:44] <03Quaker> Frances looks out of place in her evening wear, but she doesn’t make any move to join her sire or his men. She just stands quietly in a corner and looks overwhelmed. 
[22:44] <03Quaker> Count Ma doesn’t look any *more* angry. Lewis looks tense as she listens to Cav. Figueroa doesn’t have any emotion on her face. Bren is behind the frosted glass. 
[22:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Also he was wearing a mask, anyway.
01[22:46] <03banana> 6Standing/crouching in a corner ftw, in the circumstances. I mean, KJ's straightening up, but NOT doing anything that will draw notice, like wow.
[22:46] <03Crion> 4The boat on charming Ma sailed presumably before Cavanaugh was born. Either time.
[22:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is she still, like, pinning Wilson?
01[22:47] <03banana> 6No, no, barely at all. Sorry.
[22:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10No hard feelings.
[22:49] <03Quaker> Is that it?
[22:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll sit up.
[22:55] <03Quaker> Augustine Garcia flips the safety on his gun and takes it off his shoulder in one motion. The others don’t even need any special sense to feel the disorienting rebalancing as so many Beasts begin to leave. Cav’s Conestoga confirms that twenty-three kindred and one of the People are leaving the building. 
[22:56] <03Crion> 4Hahaha.
[22:56] <03Crion> 4Well, that's interesting.
[22:57] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Now, with who we have left, I believe we can fill my conference room precisely. Shall we?"
[22:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sure, why not.
[22:58] <03Quaker> The office floor seems much more spacious than it did a few minutes ago. Ma looks at the door, and then goes to stand next to Yuan. They end up sitting next to each other in the conference room as people file in. Lewis and Figueroa remain standing on opposite sides of the table, near the middle. 
[22:58] <03Crion> 4Is Bren's presentation still up?
01[22:58] <03banana> 6...KJ doesn't really want to go in there, in case one of Bren's people asks why she's here. She's not making any objection, but she'll hang back on the basis of allowing the elders in first and end up somewhere near the back of the herd. An inappropriate term if there ever was one.
[23:00] <03Quaker> It is. Speaking of, Bren hasn’t moved. Apparently the commotion wasn’t enough to stir him. As people file in, his mask inclines slightly. 
[23:01] <03Quaker> “Count Ma.” 
[23:01] <03Quaker> “Welcome.” 
[23:01] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Count Bren, we unfortunately have a number of new guests -- certainly not my intention, but I don't see why that should get in the way of our business."
[23:01] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Please, continue."
01[23:03] <03banana> 6Once KJ's in the room, she's watching for.. ah! 
01[23:03] <03banana> 6Relaxing, one of the Four Permitted Barons sidles over to Frances to check on her. Another club, right?
[23:06] <03Quaker> Bren doesn’t move or speak. 
[23:08] <03Quaker> Count Ma seems to have kept his temper in check. “Baron Cavanaugh. I have a matter to discuss with the Count. Could we resolve that before…this…proceeds?” 
[23:09] <03Crion> 4Cav's voice gets a few degrees colder. "Well. If there's nothing more to say, then I suppose we can get straight to testimonials from your previous partners."
[23:11] <03Crion> 4Cav, to Ma: "Of course, Count. Please."
[23:13] <03Quaker> Bren’s bulk shifts once more. “Perhaps we should postpone our talk for another night. Tempers are running high. There is nothing to be gained here for anyone.” 
01[23:15] <03banana> 6He's not wrong.
[23:16] <03Quaker> Count Ma: “My childe was approached by the Count after her intention of making an establishment of her own became public knowledge. I…declined to release my funds to her. I thought that her choice of venue was unbecoming.” 
[23:17] <03Quaker> Frances stares at her hands on the conference table.
[23:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson raises his hand and waits to be called on.
[23:18] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh: "Yes, Baron Hollywood?"
[23:18] <03Quaker> “I didn’t raise to her to be involved with business. She didn’t understand that the loan she was offered would mean-“ Ma looks at Wilson. 
[23:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Before we embarrass Frances in front of the entire covenant, does someone want to check and make sure that's actually Bren?"
[23:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Cause..."
[23:19] <03Quaker> Ma: “What?” 
[23:20] <03Quaker> Figueroa: “What?” 
[23:20] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh pauses, and then laughs.
[23:21] <03Quaker> All eyes in the room turn to look at the Count. 
[23:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You two don't hear that?"
[23:22] <03Quaker> Bren: “Enough. This is..this is enough. I will take my leave. Come, Baron Lakewood.” 
[23:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Valeria: "Is impersonating a Count a crime?"
[23:23] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh: "Let's find out."
[23:23] <03Quaker> Bren’s massive form starts to rise. He takes an uncertain step towards the door. 
[23:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If not, do you know where I can get a porcelain mask and some credit default swaps?"
[23:23] <03Crion> 4He stalks around the table, directly towards the Count.
[23:23] <03Quaker> “Wait….stop! How dare you! Don’t you dare lay hands on me-“ 
[23:23] <03Crion> 4And reaches for 'Count Irvine's mask.
[23:25] <03Quaker> The mask comes off in Cav’s hands. It seems to have been the thing keeping the huge black cloak pinned in place, because that falls away, too. 
01[23:26] <03banana> 6Shocking!
[23:26] <03Quaker> Standing rather awkwardly on what seems to be a pair of short wooden stilts, a contraption that pulses with some sort of purple light strapped to his chest, is the pinched, bearded face of Cosmo Morgan. 
[23:27] <03Crion> 4Cav is grinning. "Cosmo Morgan. Just who I wanted to see."
[23:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson is stonefaced.
[23:27] <03Quaker> The Archon and Marquise appear at a loss for words. 
[23:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Donald Bren may be a piece of shit, but you can't fault his sense of humor.
[23:28] <03Crion> 4Without looking away from Morgan. "My advice to you, Count Ma, is to hurry home. If Donald Bren is not here, that means he's unaccounted for. Out of pocket. Could be anywhere."
[23:28] <03Quaker> Count Ma’s fists slam on the table so hard the end breaks off in a shower of plastic and particle board. “WHAT IS THIS?” 
[23:28] <03Crion> "Doing anything."
[23:28] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Simply put, this is a distraction."
[23:30] <03Quaker> Morgan: “Gh! You…um…this is…” 
[23:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The worst part is, this is only like the third or fourth most surprising thing Wilson's experienced tonight.
01[23:31] <03banana> 6This actually kind of fucking rules.
01[23:31] <03banana> 6It's all a show, now. KJ would be embarassed by her angst earlier in the night- but the only one still here is Frances who's much more embarassed. Phew!
[23:31] <03Quaker> Ma stands. “Yuan’s contract is void.” 
[23:32] <03Quaker> He has a look of pure, distilled disgust. “I trust the Court to handle…this.” 
[23:33] <03Quaker> The Count of Westlake starts to leave, and hesitates. “Baron Laguna. A word. Outside the room.” 
[23:34] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Certainly."
[23:35] <03Quaker> The Archon and Marquise’s looks of amazement are fading into indifference. Lewis’s hands are just hands again. “What a fucking disgrace. Let’s go.” 
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Speaking of Frances, how's she holding up?
[23:36] <03Quaker> She looks a bit stunned. He can’t tell if her face is knotted in supreme embarrassment or supreme relief. Maybe both? 
[23:36] <03Crion> 4Cav, to Hollywood and Anaheim: "Keep an eye on Morgan. I'm not finished with him."
[23:36] <03Quaker> Outside the room, Ma’s sword seems to have disappeared. “Thank you for…” 
[23:37] <03Quaker> “Defusing things. I…” 
[23:37] <03Crion> 4Cav waits patiently.
01[23:37] <03banana> 6:D
01[23:37] <03banana> "Mr. Morgan! Baron North Long Beach introduced us a couple of times last year, but it never really stuck."
[23:38] <03Quaker> He looks around the now mostly empty office space. “I think I’ve acted rashly tonight. You would understand, if you had a….” 
[23:39] <03Quaker> The Count composes himself. “I apologize for bursting into your home so rudely. You acted with the calm that I lacked. Thank you. For helping me, even though I forgot to ask for your help. I owe you a favor.” 
[23:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson nods at Cav and then turns to Baroness Yuan, producing a business card. "Hey. If you ever need an investor or a loan from someone who's not a psychopath, give me a call."
[23:40] <03Quaker> Morgan looks like he’s trying to will himself into death. 
[23:40] <03Quaker> Baron Hall is not saying anything, trusting that everyone has forgotten about her. 
[23:41] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh tries to look like he's not enjoying this too much. "Thank you, Count, and it's quite alright. No lasting harm was done. Please don't concern yourself about it overmuch." 4Given the value of a favor, Cav won't be billing him for the conference table.
[23:41] <03Crion> "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a man to see about a crime. Good evening, Count. Good evening, Baron."
01[23:42] <03banana> 6KJ: "Burne was of the opinion your star is rising- any luck?" 6She's turned her attention entirely onto Cosmo now. It should be flattering!
[23:42] <03Quaker> The Archon and the Marquise pass Cavanaugh in the hall. “Nobody’s killng each other. I guess we’re done here,” says Lewis. She looks back at the room. “You’re the lawman, aren’t you, Cavanaugh? You clean this up.” She, Figueroa, and Ma take their leave. 
[23:43] <03Crion> 4Cav just grins, and walks back into the conference room.
[23:44] <03Quaker> Morgan sees him enter. “The…I only….” 
[23:44] <03Crion> "I should kill you. I really should just kill you."
[23:45] <03Quaker> Baroness Hall tries to make her escape. “Baron Laguna, this unmasking is simply shocking. I’ll leave it to you to act justly. Goodnight.” If no one stops her, she’ll hastily exit stage left. 
[23:45] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Oh no you don't."
[23:46] <03Crion> "Sit the hell down, Baron."
[23:46] <03Quaker> Hall: “Uwah!-“ She sits back down, looking guilty. 
01[23:47] <03banana> 6So there's nobody left in the room who outranks, say, Baron Hollywood, right?
[23:48] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Cosmo Morgan has neither the brain nor the spine to pull this off by himself. And I suggest not asking me to believe that three of Bren's attendants came here truly unaware that it was not Count Irvine beneath that mask. I will take it as an insult."
[23:49] <03Quaker> There isn’t anyone who outranks Baron Hollywood. 
[23:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: "What interests me is whether the four of you were stupid enough to do this without Bren's permission."
01[23:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "There can't be anyone that stupid left in Los Angeles, Baron."
[23:51] <03Quaker> Hall doesn’t seem to be interested in further dissembling. “Esparza and Valens didn’t know. They just…they were grateful for the Count’s sudden favor.” 
[23:54] <03Crion> 4Cav: "How long has this been going on? How many other deals?"
03[23:55] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[23:56] <03Quaker> Hall: “On and off for the last year. Maybe a half dozen.” 
01[23:57] <03banana> 6KJ's got her phone recording again. 
[23:58] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You will provide names, dates, amounts transferred, and you will provide the original contracts, Baron Lakewood. And then what we're going to do is we're going to call each one of your debtors into this office, where I am going to explain the situation, you are going to apologize, and we will negotiate a restitution appropriate to the degree of deception and usury involved."
[23:59] <03Quaker> Hall: “On one condition.” 
[23:59] <03Crion> 4Cav blinks. "You look to set conditions?"
Session Time: Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03Crion> "I have been given full authority of law here. This isn't going to the Judex. It stays with me. With that in mind, please, propose your condition."
[00:00] <03Quaker> Hall: “Yes. We still have leverage. If only a little.” 
[00:00] <03Quaker> Morgan seems to be leaving the defense to her. 
[00:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wonder why.
[00:01] <03Quaker> “You protect us. Hide us. Whatever you have to do to make sure we stay out of Bren’s hands.” 
[00:01] <03Quaker> “That’s my only condition.” 
01[00:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "Question."
[00:03] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Ask away."
01[00:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "Who made the loan to Baron Garden Grove?"
[00:05] <03Crion> 
[00:05] <03Crion> 4Cav is going over possibilites in his head. Where to put a safe house?
[00:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson, to Morgan: "If we're asking questions... when Bren put this together, had he just heard of Scooby Doo for the first time?"
[00:06] <03Crion> 4Dana Point would be best, but he'd have to check with Leisurely first.
[00:06] <03Quaker> Hall: “A fund in Morgan’s name. We set it up so that if there were any losses, it would fall on a different fund, owned by Bren.” 
[00:07] <03Quaker> Hall answers for Morgan. “Bren didn’t know.” 
[00:07] <03Quaker> “Doesn’t.” 
[00:07] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I think the safest phrasing of that is 'we didn't tell Bren.'"
[00:07] <03Crion> "Not 'Bren didn't know.'"
[00:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Jesus."
[00:08] <03Quaker> “Do you agree to our condition?” 
[00:08] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh: "For you, Baron, yes."
[00:08] <03Crion> "For you, Morgan, things are more complicated."
[00:10] <03Crion> "You have put Sponger Souza in a very unfortunate situation. You, of course, having no standing with the Judex -- Bren brought the case against Souza, and only Bren can drop it."
[00:11] <03Quaker> Morgan: “I see.” 
[00:11] <03Crion> "So quite honestly my instinct is just to kick you out the door and let the problem of Cosmo Morgan quickly solve itself."
01[00:12] <03banana> 6After a moment's fiddling with phone multitasking, KJ is going to text Frances. 9<Are you ok with them getting away with this?9>
[00:12] <03Crion> "But then I remind myself how many times I've thought that would happen, and how many times I've then had you pop right back up. Like a weed."
[00:12] <03Crion> 4Cav: "And I get to thinking maybe I should just kill you myself. Lord knows you've earned it."

[00:17] <03Quaker> Morgan: “You don’t - it wasn’t just the schemes, we had to-“ 
[00:17] <03Quaker> Hall: “Cosmo, shut up!” 
[00:18] <03Quaker> She turns to Cav: “Any condition that’s for me is for him, too. Please.” 
[00:19] <03Quaker> “Please. I’m asking you for mercy. I’ll explain everything. Including…” 
[00:19] <03Quaker> “I know your reputation. Your…interests.” She crosses her arms. “But if you throw Morgan out, I won’t say anything else. And you’ll just be left with your curiosity.” 
[00:20] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I am never, ever left with just my curiosity, Baron Lakewood. Trust in that."
[00:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's pretty bold. It's not like she's got any other plays, though.
[00:20] <03Crion> "But for now, given a lack of a more elegant solution, fine."
[00:20] <03Quaker> Frances texts back. <Isn’t Bren just going to kill them?> 
01[00:21] <03banana> 9<Not if our dude here hates him enough to keep them safe.9>
01[00:21] <03banana> 6KJ: "Something worth mentioning. If you're interested in making peace with Lord Bren, these guys would be a great place to start."
[00:23] <03Quaker> “It didn’t start out with making loans. That was just a…mistake. I guess we just got unlucky.” Hall uncrosses her arms. “We were trying to do the right thing.” 
[00:24] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Bren doesn't make peace. And I don't believe that he was uninvolved in this, even if he didn't reveal himself to these two."
[00:27] <03Crion> 4Besides, there's no better way to get a sit down with the man than dangling these two out on the line and waiting for him to bite.
01[00:27] <03banana> 6KJ: "He makes deals. You'd show him you were willing to deal, get into a place where this cold war could turn.. colder."
[00:29] <03Quaker> Hall: “But…you already agreed…” 
[00:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's a cold world."
[00:32] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But perhaps it doesn't have to be. I will arrange for accomodations. You will not be leaving town, however, until we have not only reversed all the damage done here, but had frank conversations about the extent of this plan and the reasons behind it." 
[00:34] <03Quaker> Hall: “Wait! You don’t know what he’s like lately…” 
[00:34] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Then I advise you to tell us."
[00:35] <03Quaker> Hall: “Not until you stop saying you’ll use us as bait!” 
01[00:36] <03banana> 6KJ: "It was my idea, Lakewood, and he rejected it. No need to panic."
[00:38] <03Crion> 4Cav: "It would probably be best if you're not kept together. Less suspicious that way."
[00:39] <03Quaker> Hall: “We had to do *something*. Bren just vanished. For months, sometimes. Without any kind of contingency set up. No proxies, no instructions. We were his secretaries…were we just supposed to let everything fall apart? He has so many connections…and some have to have him there in person.” 
[00:40] <03Quaker> “And when he came back…he wouldn’t talk about what he’d been doing, or where he’d been. We tried to track him once, but we lost sight of him a few miles out of the territory…” 
[00:40] <03Quaker> “But when we talked to him, confronted him about it…I don’t think he actually remembered what he did. Like…he just has, um. Gaps.” 
[00:41] <03Crion> 4That is...highly concerning.
[00:41] <03Quaker> “And if we didn’t do something, try to maintain appearances, how many people would try to take advantage? How much worse would it be if we didn’t try to keep things running?” 
[00:42] <03Quaker> “Did we profit from it? Sure, but…this is the Invictus, isn’t it? It would be more shameful if we hadn’t.” 
01[00:42] <03banana> 6She's not wrong.
[00:42] <03Quaker> “Then we wouldn’t even be hapless…we’d be stupid, too. Stupider.” 
[00:43] <03Quaker> “It’s not like he’d thank us for being honest.” 
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav: "...Is Bren in town right now?"
[00:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Couldn't you just have embezzled? If he was gone all the time why not just run off with his money instead of scamming other people?"
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're fucked if he catches you either way. Why raise your profile?"
[00:46] <03Quaker> Hall: “No. He’s…I don’t know where. We still have a little time before he comes back, I think.” To Wilson: “Look, it’s not like it would have been out of character for Bren to do something like this. He just would have done it better. Not ended up like this, with everyone mad at you at the same time…” 
[00:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Bren ends up with everyone mad at him all the time all the time. He just doesn't care."
[00:47] <03Crion> 4Cav rolls his eyes. "So he didn't file against Sponger with the Judex."
[00:47] <03Crion> "Morgan did."
[00:47] <03Crion> 4To Morgan: "It's fucking ludicrous that I'm letting you live."
01[00:50] <03banana> 6KJ: "Maybe it can't be helped. Bren was here earlier in the week, right? When they had the ballet."
[00:50] <03Quaker> Morgan, for once, doesn’t have anything to say. 
01[00:50] <03banana> "So he's vanished in the last few days.."
[00:50] <03Quaker> Hall: “Um. That was us. At the ballet. He took off in the middle of the night, a day after a meeting with Helena Murray.” 
[00:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's concerning.
[00:51] <03Crion> 4With contempt: "Murray."
01[00:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Interesting timing." 6!!!!!
[00:56] <03Quaker> Hall: “I guess…that’s pretty much the gist of it. We can go over all the details later, I guess.” 
[00:59] <03Quaker> Later, after they’ve been bundled off to an undisclosed location, KJ is left to speculate about the meaning of the various interesting data that’s come her way recently. 
01[00:59] <03banana> 6One datum is, of course, that location. Just how undisclosed are we talking..?
[01:01] <03Quaker> Blythe takes the news evenly from Wilson. It doesn’t seem to be something she was expecting, but it’s also a better outcome than nobles killing each other. Does he tell her that Bren has apparently vanished and re-appeared with gaps in his memory? 
[01:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Yep. Everything. Also whatever weird shit Cavanaugh got from those diaries.
[01:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's not like he has anyone in particular to keep secrets for.
[01:03] <03Quaker> Hall said that Bren isn’t in town at the moment, so for now both fugitives go into a quickly cleared-out safehouse in Laguna. They can be divvied up more permanently later. 
[01:07] <03Quaker> Blythe stops Wilson when he’s reading her the transcript of the diaries. “Wait, three siblings in Los Padres?” 
[01:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's what it says."
[01:09] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Hm. Ok, sorry. Go on.” Later, after he’s finished, she thinks for a while. “Did you ever learn about the Circle?” 
[01:10] <03Quaker> “Beyond the hunts, I mean.” 
[01:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not really. Never seemed to make sense to study people I can't talk to."
[01:13] <03Quaker> In the early morning, long after everything has settled down, KJ hears a knock on her door. That might be figurative, if her sensors or whatever are tripped by someone coming up to her house. 
[01:16] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I guess I didn’t really know Franks well enough to understand if he’s speaking literally or symbolically. Three actual siblings seems unlikely. But Circle ritual repeats things in threes. It’s their religion, after all. Maiden, Mother, Crone.” 
[01:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You think he means witches?"
01[01:18] <03banana> 6KJ's not in bed yet, but she's dressed for it. Long night. What does this all mean? She's got less reason to hate Count Bren than she thought, and it might be best to reconcile him and the target if possible.. Cavanaugh doesn't deserve what's happening here. At least not more than anyone else in the Invictus. But this 'illness', the timing of it.. the mentions of amnesia earlier. And whatever the heck is in those diaries.
[01:19] <03Quaker> Blythe: “No one else lives out there.” 
01[01:19] <03banana> 6She hears the knock literally - her bedroom is basically above the front door - but flicks on a security camera feed to see who's there.
[01:20] <03Quaker> It’s blurred. A kindred. 
01[01:20] <03banana> 6Phew. Probably a friend, then,
01[01:21] <03banana> 6But you've got to keep up appearances and do things a certain way. KJ throws something on over her nightgown and goes down to answer the door.
[01:23] <03Quaker> Well, maybe a friend. It’s the insane woman from the opera with the funny name. Leisurely something. 
01[01:25] <03banana> 6The one who thinks you there are things it's best not to know..? "Good morning, Leisurely. Something you need?"
01[01:25] <03banana> *who thinks there are things
[01:26] <03Quaker> The short woman in the blue dress looks a bit unfocused. “What do you think the diary entry means?” 
[01:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Do you know anyone in the Circle?"
[01:29] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I think ‘know’ is a bit of a stretch. I have an understanding with certain people, so that they stay out of my territory and I stay out of theirs. A bit like a neighbor you’re glad to forget exists. But I don’t talk to them.” 
01[01:30] <03banana> 6KJ: "You'd better come in. I have the fridge, or tea if you like."
01[01:32] <03banana> 6The ground floor of K. J. Valentine's townhouse is pretty open; there's one big room with a media centre, a kitchen with attached and disused dining area, the stairs and some storage. Leisurely Foster has the choice of a sofa in front of a mess of game controllers or high chairs by the kitchen.
01[01:32] <03banana> "I wouldn't mind telling you what I think, but let's trade- why do you know about this diary at all?"
[01:34] <03Quaker> Leisurely takes a high chair and waits while KJ makes tea. “I can psychically project my consciousness and look at what people are doing.” 
[01:35] <03Quaker> “I was watching Cavanaugh as he decoded it. And I saw he shared it with you.” 
01[01:37] <03banana> 6..this is no charity case.
[01:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't really want to keep digging around for ghosts."
[01:39] <03Quaker> Blythe: “It’s a game for those who have few of their own.” 
[01:39] <03Quaker> “I guess it’s easier when you don’t think the secrets you uncover will have anything to do with you.” 
[01:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I bet Valentine'll be all over this."
01[01:40] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's quite something." 6The tea isn't very good. Not quite hot enough, so the bags are basically mulchy on the outside but solid inside. "No wonder you ask about peoples' reactions instead of facts."
01[01:41] <03banana> "The diary entries Clint Cavanaugh showed me are all sun-obsessed. Futurology and solar worship."
01[01:41] <03banana> "The occultism in the last one reminded me of some cultists who killed me once."
01[01:42] <03banana> "I also thought, obviously, that I'd better find out who lives in Los Padres sometime."
[01:42] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “The Circle of the Crone.” 
01[01:42] <03banana> 6KJ makes a face. "That might prohibit further enquiry."
01[01:43] <03banana> 6Why be honest with this strange woman? Well, because she can psychically project her consciousness and look at what people are doing. Just how true is that?
[01:43] <03Quaker> Blythe: “You should relax for a while. I’m sure I’ll have to ask for your help sooner rather than later.” 
[01:43] <03Quaker> “…” 
[01:44] <03Quaker> “Thank you, Wilson. And I’m sorry if I…” 
[01:44] <03Quaker> “Made you uncomfortable, earlier. I don’t want to confuse things.” 
[01:45] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Why?” 
01[01:45] <03banana> 6KJ: "Well, I'm informed that they murder you on sight?"
[01:46] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Not always. They’re just people.” 
01[01:48] <03banana> 6KJ: "Pretty terrifying people. Like, I once spent two nights hiding in a car with an incredibly annoying man because the road we were travelling was claimed by witches who had it 'hexed against gasoline'. Or just recently I had to flee from what was basically a zombie crow the size of a bus?"
01[01:48] <03banana> "I'm totally open to rapproachment and a discussion of contemporary political theology, it'd just have to take place on neutral territory, through megaphones."
[01:49] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Are they less frightening than the people you’re friends with?” 
01[01:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's gonna depend on whether 'friends' is a euphemism for participation in the Invictus power structures, because if you mean friends friends: yes."
[01:52] <03Quaker> Leisurely looks down into her tea. “What was the cult that killed you?” 
[01:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson weighs his words. "Blythe, this has been a very odd night, and I don't want to confuse things either. But I had a nice time, and I enjoy your company. I hope I wasn't too brusque about it."
01[01:57] <03banana> 6KJ: "It was actually really well done! Like it was basically a startup where the product was a secret society, but the secret behind that: vampires. And then there was a real secret society behind the vampires."
01[01:58] <03banana> "In order the layers were called like, The Latitude, The Movement, The Bak-Ra, the something else I never learned. They got super, super fucked up by mainstream San Francisco."
01[01:59] <03banana> "I mean, mainstream vampire San Francisco."
[01:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'd like to see you more often. Maybe give you a gift that doesn't decapitate people at some point."
[02:00] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “’As there are flowers, like the rose, which are a thousand flowers in one, so there are worlds in dreamland which are a thousand worlds one within the other. And into one such world I wandered so deeply, that I said ‘I will awake no more.’’” 
01[02:01] <03banana> 6KJ: "Did you know Thomas Franks, perhaps?"
[02:02] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I had a nice time, too. I suppose we both know where the other lives. Goodnight, Wilson.” She hangs up. 
[02:03] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Yes. A long time ago.” 
01[02:04] <03banana> 6KJ: "That wrecks my mean-spirited joke. It's probably for the best."
[02:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's one of the most pleasant phone conversation's Wilson's had sober in years.
[02:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10...this is the first time Wilson's gone this deep into the night without a drink in years.
[02:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Thinking about that makes him want to drink.
[02:04] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Did you?” 
[02:05] <03Quaker> Wilson’s door buzzes. 
[02:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson opens it personally.
[02:07] <03Quaker> Solitude Agnew stands on his front porch, a chess board held under his arm. “Wilson. Someone told me you were getting out more. I thought I’d see if you were up for some company.” 
01[02:08] <03banana> 6KJ: "Ms. Foster, I'm not totally sure on the timeline but I think he was gone before I was born."
[02:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sol! God, how long's it been. Come in!"
[02:10] <03Quaker> The elderly baron follows Wilson into his house, and lets his host make them both comfortable with chairs and refreshments. He’ll courteously accept a drink if one is offered, but he doesn’t ask for one. 
[02:11] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Oh. Sorry.” 
[02:11] <03Quaker> “Time passes quickly, huh. Sometimes. Other times it feels like it’s been the same moment, forever.” 
[02:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson doesn't offer, mostly because if he offers one he'll have one too. Let's see how far we can ride this out. "How've you been?"
[02:15] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I’ve kept busy. It feels as if I’ve missed some developments, though. Funny. You watch something for a long time, and so few things change. Yet the moment you look away, the pieces start shifting. I’ve lost my appetite for this nonsense, though.” 
[02:17] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Do you want to know more about the Circle?” 
[02:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't blame you. Politics... if I had more taste for it I'd probably have gotten out more to begin with. Still, past the politics, there's some interesting people. I actually met someone recently who reminded me a bit of you."
01[02:19] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yyyes. It-" 6That was about time passing, not the Circle, but she's been preempted. "The 'witches' of the woods? Sure. I'd like to know who they are in 2017, how to beat or join em, how they do what they do with the blood.."
01[02:20] <03banana> "This isn't a recruiting pitch, though? I'm not going to report you or anything if it is, I'm just not interested in learning on those terms."
[02:20] <03Quaker> Solitude sets up the pieces on the board. “Who?” 
[02:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks down at the board as Solitude sets it up. "One of the new barons, girl down from the Bay Republic. Defector. Valentine's the name. You met her yet?"
[02:23] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “I’m not recruiting anyone. I don’t know what they’re like in 2017. A friend of mine used to write about them, years ago. He was interested in what they were like.” 
[02:24] <03Quaker> Solitude: “The one they put in Anaheim? No.” 
01[02:26] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm always interested in reading material if you've got something interesting!"
[02:27] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “Oh. I don’t have it. You’d have to talk to him.” 
[02:27] <03Quaker> “He died, though.” 
[02:28] <03Quaker> Solitude watches Wilson’s hands as they move a pawn. “What’s got you out and about?” 
01[02:29] <03banana> 6...
[02:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "My office is haunted. They're fumigating it now."
01[02:30] <03banana> "Sorry to hear that. Your ESP doesn't extend to the dead, I assume?"
[02:32] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “No. All their things are being looked after by an acquaintance. You could ask them.” 
[02:33] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Whose ghost?” 
[02:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10See, that's why Wilson likes Sol. You can joke around and he still just plows ahead. Man's mind is on rails. "Laura's."
[02:36] <03Quaker> Solitude’s hand stops over a rook for a moment. “Oh. Sorry to hear it.” 
[02:36] <03Quaker> “I didn’t know that was still a problem.” 
[02:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's not."
[02:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Or at least, it's not that kind of problem."
[02:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That never happened to me before and now it's happened to me twice in a month. So either I've gone insane or something's going on."
[02:38] <03Quaker> Solitude: “How likely do you think that it’s the former? I can recommend someone if you’re worried.” 
[02:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So I've been getting out more -" 10Pins a bishop. "-because either I need to get out more to stop going stir crazy, or because I want to know what made that happen."
[02:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I have no idea how likely it is. I'm not worried about it at all, though."
[02:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'd make an excellent lunatic."
[02:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I suppose I've been thinking about death more."
[02:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What about you? What've you been keeping busy with besides the nonsense?"
[02:42] <03Quaker> Leisurely: “If you do, though…maybe you should be careful. That person has changed a bit, lately.” 
[02:44] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Anyone can make an excellent lunatic. It’s the rest of us who’d have to put up with you.” Solitude will lose a knight, but he’s out of the trap. “This and that. Research. ‘Mentoring.’ There’s a-“ He stops, reconsiders mentioning something. “That’s about it. As always. What do you mean when you say you’re thinking about death?” 
[02:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Do you remember what it was like the moment you realized you weren't going to die?"
[02:48] <03Quaker> Leisurely writes the phone number down on a napkin. “I’ll be around, if you want to talk. Give the number to Cavanaugh as well, please. I know he’d be curious about it. Goodnight.” 
[02:48] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I don’t remember ever having that realization. I’m certainly going to die of something.” 
[02:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's the thing. Used to be, death was just a law of nature. Everybody dies, everybody goes into the dark and there's heaven or hell or nothing or whatever. Now, to say that you or I are going to die is just... something has to, eventually, kill us. Practically it's as true as it's ever been. But now it has all the weight of a statistical observation. "
[02:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It seems more malleable, somehow. I don't know, it's not a fully formed thought yet."
[02:56] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I don’t think a normal mind is equipped to adjust for the disintegration of immediate meaning that we experience. Assuming you live long enough to understand that the transition has taken place. Most don’t.” 
[02:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't think many of us have normal minds."
[02:57] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Really? I think too many of us have them.”

[03:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Unambitious, maybe. But normal?"
[03:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He shrugs. "People think about things when something makes them. People with boring thoughts are usually just oblivious."
[03:07] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I don’t mean it as a condemnation. It’s not as if our is a particularly common condition. Ambition….faith, politics, whatever, it simply can’t adjust sufficiently. You can be smart, or good, or ambitious. It doesn’t change anything.” 
[03:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What does?"
[03:12] <03Quaker> Solitude loses his king, and resets the pieces. “A fundamental restructuring. Examining the system and altering it in a way more permanent than aspirational.” 
[03:13] <03Quaker> “It’s only a retooling. You were built for one thing. Build yourself once more, for another thing.” 
[03:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You know, I've been getting variations on that a lot lately."
[03:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The question I keep coming back to is: what other thing?"
[03:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Hard to build without a plan, you know?"
[03:16] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Well, it’s the subject of debate. Which plan, and all that. I can only claim expertise on my own research. The rest might as well be myth.” 
[03:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What sort of research?"
[03:18] <03Quaker> “The proprietary sort.” Solitude loses a knight. “No offense meant, Wilson.” 
[03:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Just promise me you're not going to turn into Thomas Franks."
[03:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I saw Laura up at his place, too. Everyone saw ghosts, it seemed like."
[03:21] <03Quaker> A surprised smile passes over Solitude’s face for a moment. “That’s a name I haven’t heard in a while. How did you run across him?” 
[03:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "A little while back one of the schismatics down in Orange County keyed up Bren's gofer and went into hiding. I went out looking for him with a couple of barons and a schismatic deacon. He was holed up in what's left of Franks's place. Dead witch on the floor, ghosts all over. Kid was bleeding naturally."
[03:25] <03Quaker> Solitude is slowly rotating a taken pawn in his hand, which Wilson knows means he’s listening intently. 
[03:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Left behind all these coded notes about seeing the sun again. That was the first thing that popped into my head when you mentioned research."
[03:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Do you think Franks knew what he was rebuilding himself into?"
[03:28] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I doubt it. His reputation was that of a dabbler. I didn’t know him personally.” 
[03:28] <03Quaker> Solitude thinks for a while. “What do you mean, ‘seeing the sun again?’” 
[03:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I don't have the text in front of me but he was fixated with the sun. It was like a religious thing. I don't know what it meant to him. And he's dead now, so."
[03:36] <03Quaker> Solitude: “He didn’t mention the color of the sun, did he?” 
[03:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "He did."
[03:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But c'mon, you gotta tell me something about your research too."
[03:42] <03Quaker> “What do you want to know?” 
[03:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I want to know what you're aiming at."
[03:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Building toward. Pick whatever metaphor you like. What's the new thing that's not the old thing?"
[03:45] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I think you might be giving me too much credit. It’s hardly fleshed out enough to be some sort of program.” 
[03:45] <03Quaker> “Still, I suppose…” 
[03:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm not looking to copy you. I just want to know what you think is better than this."
[03:46] <03Quaker> Solitude thinks. 
[03:48] <03Quaker> “Understand that I don’t mean to approach this work in a moral capacity. When you say “better”, what could you mean? I only mean more fitting, in the sense of the engineer. I’m uninterested in what someone might do with a transfigured capacity. I’m much more interested in how achieve a different capacity in the first place.” 
[03:48] <03Quaker> He motions to the chessboard. “If you want a metaphor, I can give you one.” 
[03:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The only value judgment I want is yours. The one implicit in spending your time and energy on the work."
[03:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sure."
[03:51] <03Quaker> “Look at this pawn. It can only move one space. Its sole limitation. Now imagine it had a mind. Passions, dreams, consciousness, a family, a history, whatever. And whatever it contained in itself, it would only exist in the mold of that limitation, of only moving a certain way, one space at a time, in one direction.” 
[03:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sure."
[03:58] <03Quaker> “If it reaches the end of the board, it’s transformed. It can move an infinite number of spaces, in any direction. This is the first transformation - say, your rebirth as kindred. But the passions, the understanding, the mind, they remain the same. It has infinite freedom, and nothing to fill it with. It can go in one direction, one space at a time, the only motion it can imagine, even after this change in essence. The interior hasn’t 
[03:58] <03Quaker> caught up to the exterior. What I’m interested in is a secondary transformation. What if we could alter the essence-inside-the-essence? So that the pawn could find something to fill that space with? What directions could it travel then? All of them, for any length.” He puts the pawn back down. “Not that I would know what that’s like. But the possibility is the intriguing part, for now.” He laughs. “Until you really can perceive 
[03:58] <03Quaker> your own transformation, I suppose. Then little of what interests us now would suffice.” 
[04:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "A mind as unrecognizable from its original condition as our bodies are."
[04:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's hard to wrap your head around, since the ways our body changes tend to encourage stasis and aren't equipped for introspection."
[04:04] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Sure. What do you do with it?” He shrugs. “Who knows? Whatever you like. If you transformed an ant into a man, you wouldn’t expect a coherent expectation from the ant of what it hopes to do afterwards.” 
[04:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But what sort of ant looks at a man and says 'I bet I could become that'."
[04:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I guess not a normal one."
[04:06] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I don’t know. I can’t read other people’s minds.” 
[04:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Some of us can, though. But they can't read their own."
[04:07] <03Quaker> “As for stasis…yes and no. Much of it is just culturally encouraged. You’d be surprised to see how quickly and easily some changes can occur, despite being in conflict with our nature. Well, our ‘nature,’ as explained by the priests and the kings.” 
[04:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Everybody can think of things they want to change about themselves. But nobody really grapples with the fact that if you do it, you won't be the person who wanted to do it anymore. And who knows what you'll want then?"
[04:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "A lot of it is cultural, but culture's as hard to change as anything else is."
[04:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Makes it easy to see why someone'd get tired of it."
[04:10] <03Quaker> Solitude: “You know, someone else is just as interested in that as I am with the individual.” 
[04:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mm?"
[04:14] <03Quaker> “You meet all kinds of interesting people, actually. The drive manifests in different emphases, different questions. One asks, what changes with the individual’s change? Another asks, can we transform society in the same way? Another asks, why only ourselves, why not all life, plants, bacteria, whatever lives. Another asks why only here, why this context, maybe the infinite movement is fitted to an infinite space.” He mimes the pawn 
[04:14] <03Quaker> transforming into a rocket, taking off. “Pwwsh.” He smiles. “Hard to find a sufficient budget for that last one.” 
[04:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Huh."
[04:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But on some level, you're still describing the pawn's logic, yeah?"
[04:20] <03Quaker> The smile fades. “Some get lost trying to prematurely grasp something else.” 
[04:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "All these changes, all these unimaginable perspectives and possibilities... they're still anchored in the way the pawn sees the world." 10He slides one frmo the home row up two squares. "There is only forward."
[04:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "'From the road that led down to the Broadway Tunnel I saw the red disk of the sun rising over the promised city.'"
[04:25] <03Quaker> Solitude: “What’s that?” 
[04:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Some of the writing we pulled from Franks's notes."
[04:28] <03Quaker> Solitude. “Oh.” 
[04:28] <03Quaker> After a while: “Surprised to see you running around with some new barons.” 
[04:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's nice being around people who don't know enough to look at me with pity."
[04:31] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I can’t imagine the arrogance it would take to see you as a lesson in something, and not a person you share a condition with.” 
[04:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I know. You've always been a friend."
[04:34] <03Quaker> He checks his watch. “Hm. That went fast. I’ll have to come see you more often, Wilson. I’ve got to get back to Westwood. There’s someone who’s been a pain in my ass lately, who I still - well, you know how office politics are.” He gets his coat. 
[04:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll walk him out. "Please. Don't be a stranger, Sol."
[04:37] <03Quaker> As they’re shaking goodbye on the front porch: “You know, I have more than a little pull in my circle. If you’re interested, I could make some introductions. There’s an exhibition of sorts coming up. It’s supposed to be a members-only thing, but…I trust your discretion. And we were all on the outside, once. Let me know. See you around.” He sets off across the gravel pathway leading to the lot, his car far off in the distance.

[22:07] <03Quaker> Deacon Tommy Saldana's phone rings. Number unknown. 
[22:07] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwlPeW2eBHw
[22:10] <03tom> 14He picks up. "Yeah?"
[22:11] <03Quaker> Meanwhile, the rest of the gang wakes up to an atmosphere of halfway released tension. The madness and violence of the last few days is over, finally. Or at least, partly. Cav and Wilson might have unexpected houseguests, but otherwise they have no pressing matters. KJ has a lead on some more Circle information, and no request for an update from the good Baron Murray's people. That last bit is a bit odd; usually she relies o
[22:11] <03Quaker> n a constant stream of information from her minions. 
01[22:15] <03banana> 6Could be good - no need to ask what Cavanaugh has been up to because the whole city knows. Could be bad - no need to ask KJ because she isn't trusted anymore. But knowing that the famous and terrible Bren is in some sense being puppeteered takes away a bit of the sting of fear.
[22:15] <03tom> 14The Deacon's on edge, and won't take long before hanging up. Is this 'phishing?' Am I being 'phished'? "Hello?" Irritated now.
[22:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav's given the Baron Lakewood feeding privileges for Laguna, so long as she abides by his fairly strict rules -- don't kill your food, don't fuck your food, and no ghouling.
[22:18] <03Quaker>  Tommy is answered by someone who sounds like they're cradling a cell phone between their shoulder and their neck, typing, and eating, all at the same time. "Uh, yeah, is this Deacon Saldana? Clarabelle told me to ask you when you were coming in." 
[22:19] <03Crion_> 4More importantly, he's also ordered a bunch of stuff off Amazon to furnish a guest suite with.
[22:20] <03tom> 14Tommy instantly begins to sweat. "Uh, yeah, sure. For uh, for what?"
[22:20] <03Crion_> 4And given her the WiFi password. Perhaps he should get in touch with KJ about keeping an eye on what Baron Lakewood is doing online while she's a guest of his barony.
01[22:21] <03banana> 6Well. If nobody's asking, KJ isn't volunteering her knowledge of Morgan and Lakewood's whereabouts. It's a trump card, maybe. 
[22:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Any houseguest is unexpected for Wilson. He's spent his evening doing, against all reason, his actual job, which tonight means spending three hours arguing with a producer about Star Trek, like it's 1992 again.
01[22:21] <03banana> 6So what's on the agenda tonight? There was that strange visit from Leisurely Foster, who KJ will need to cultivate if she can really do long-range ESP. Information to pass on. Send an apology on an ironic salver to Wilson Frost.. catch up with Wesley the Stammerer, although this club idea is going nowhere.. 
[22:22] <03Quaker> Sauer: "To get you wired up...? Oh, this is K- this is Presbyter Sauer. Did she not tell you...? You should call her." 
01[22:23] <03banana> 6Also asking Frances where she's going with the club now, and catching up with like a week's worth of RSS. No wonder the elders fall further and further behind on technology. Maybe she just won't sleep.
[22:24] <03tom> "Okay. Thanks, kid." 14He has no idea if Sauer is younger than him. The Deacon hangs up, rubs his eyes blearily, then punches in a new set of numbers.
[22:24] <03Crion_> 4Cav spends the nights immediately following the fracas at the office splitting his time between the mansion and the condo with Kayleigh; catches up on some sleep, some studying, and some paperwork.
[22:24] <03tom> 14He wedges the phone between his shoulder and his ear.
[22:24] <03Quaker> "EXCUSE M-" Clarabelle sounds tired. "Hello?" 
[22:26] <03tom> "Hey, it's Saldana." 14He pauses. "Sauer wanted me to call you?"
[22:26] <03tom> "Something about 'getting wired up'?"
01[22:26] <03banana> 6After attending to a few routine duties at the office - do they have anything yet on the bullets she sent away? - KJ finds herself at the chocolate shop down the street, juggling phone calls.
[22:26] <03tom> "Is- are you good?"
[22:27] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Oh. Did I not call you? Sorry, it's been so busy- um, just come by my office. I'll have Karin meet us there." 
[22:27] <03tom> "Sick." 14Tommy doesn't waste words.
[22:27] <03tom> 14He checks the time on his phone.
[22:28] <03Quaker> It's a few minutes after eight. 
[22:28] <03tom> 14Easy. He's got the whole night.
[22:28] <03tom> 14Deacon Saldana calls a car.
01[22:28] <03banana> 6No, of course, Wesley answered about the bullets before everything went to hell last night.. what a time.
01[22:29] <03banana> 6OK, she'll go with whichever of Yuan or Cavanaugh answers texts first.
[22:31] <03tom> 14The Deacon's got on muddy jeans as he steps out of the vehicle. It's laundry day tomorrow, so he's still got on his pants from the run out to the villa.
[22:31] <03tom> 14He's taken pains to rub the stains out of the blue denim, with a little success.
01[22:34] <03banana> 6To- why is he in her phone as 'that guy down south'? maybe Jessie messed with it. Anyway, to Cavanaugh on Signal: 9<Hey, Leisurely Foster invited herself over and told me I should give you a phone number.9>
[22:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav is reading in his study at the mansion when he gets the text.
[22:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <???>
[22:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <that woman>
01[22:36] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<I guess you know each other? And she can spy on people with magic, she said, and watched you reading a diary using that code??9>
[22:37] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <great>
[22:38] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <and hello to leisurely if she's reading this right now>
[22:39] <03Quaker> The Presbyter's office is a little space between a bowling alley and a coffee chain. If she tried to clean up before Tommy gets there, it must have been pretty bad to start with. Stacks of paperwork, books, and binders rise in little towers all across the front. He can hear her on the phone in the back. "No, he shouldn't have been moved, he'd already been registered here-" 
01[22:39] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<Not over this protocol she's not. Just make sure there's two green ticks under each message.9>
01[22:39] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<So like9>
01[22:40] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<What's going on though? I've got the number of someone who's looking after a bunch of documents about the circle of the crone.9>
[22:40] <03tom> 14The nosferatu steps up to the curb and raps on the door. He's got his eyes downcast, his hood obscuring his face from view. 
[22:40] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <huh>
01[22:40] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<Is that even something you wanted9>
[22:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's digging into his flask pocket as the call ends. Feels empty. When he looks across the room to the liquor cabinet he gets kind of a lurch in his stomach. Ehh. Ehhhhhh. He'll refill it next time he gets up. Wilson tries turning Netflix back on, but it's Buffy season 6 and he's sober so no dice there either. He clicks around a bit looking for something else before he just leans 
[22:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10back in his chair and puts his feet up, staring at the ceiling.
[22:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <it's not something I don't want>
[22:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <could be useful>
01[22:41] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<<VCARD contact data>9>
[22:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <be v. v. careful about who you talk abt this to>
[22:42] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <LA invictus don't fuck around when it comes to crone>
01[22:42] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<Ok. If there's some sort of conspiracy involved I'd definitely appreciate a warning9>
[22:43] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <if elders in plate mail helicopter into yr living room, youll know something's wrong>
01[22:43] <03banana> 6She's not going to actually eat any chocolates tonight - twice in a row would be profligate! But KJ is going to buy some for later. Thinking about who else it's necessary to speak to tonight.. oh, she has to return Okienka's courtesy call. Interesting to think about how that woman's attitude compared to that of Sherman Ma.
[22:43] <03Quaker> Clarabelle wraps up the phone call. "Okay. I'll call you back. DON'T move him again. Bye. Yes, come in, please." 
[22:44] <03tom> "Aheh, aheh," 14Saldana wheezes as the Presbyter ushers him inside.
01[22:44] <03banana> 6KJ: 9<I would prefer not to reach that point actually? But this feels like an 'in too deep' situation 💎9>
[22:45] <03tom> "Oh man, is that what it's like? You come for the theology and they just sucker you into doing paperwork forever?"
[22:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <if leisurely's showing up on your doorstep i got bad news, baron>
[22:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <you are fully In>
[22:45] <03Quaker> Wilson's phone buzzes. It's a text message from Countess Lancaster, or actually just a video of a ghoul working in the greenhouse, not paying attention to a garden hose that's become wrapped around their ankle, until they eat shit and spill a bag of potting soil all over themselves.  
[22:48] <03Quaker> Clarabelle puts her hair up in a bun. "No. If I wanted to write things no one read, I'd have stayed at St. Chrys's. At least the bishops read my reports before they throw them away." 
[22:48] <03Quaker> She gives the deacon a blank stare. "What can I- oh, right. You'd...do you want coffee or anything? I can put a pot on. Sit down, either way." She moves a stack of papers off a chair for him. 
[22:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts. <What a putz.>
[22:50] <03Quaker> Lancaster: <Almost as clumsy...as you, yourself, are!!!!! :   ) > 
[22:51] <03tom> 14Tommy's face is blank for a second. He nods. "Yeah... yeah sure. I can swing that."
[22:52] <03tom> 14He takes the chair with as gracious a look a waxen-skinned cretin could possibly muster.
[22:53] <03tom> "Sorry about the pants. Laundry's tomorrow. Still wearing the same pants from when we went out into the valley."
01[22:54] <03banana> 6KJ: <🤔 Perhaps so. Well let me know if you want to get in contact with whoever this witchlorist is>
[22:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <i have a social obligation coming up. i'll be free after that>
[22:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She's so bad at that. Wilson almost has to put his phone down he's laughing so hard. <I'm legendarily graceful. I was this close to being the next Fred Astaire.>
01[22:56] <03banana> 6Who's next.. Wilson? OK. KJ: <Mr. Hollywood. Sorry about the assault and battery, which is poor repayment for your introduction to a weird complex of quests and personal issues>
[22:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Phone beeps. It's Valentine. <Yeah. You should've come at me with a harpoon or something for this.>
[22:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> <No hard feelings. We got through the night with zero murders which is all I wanted.>
01[22:59] <03banana> 6Everyone types so slowly and Frances isn't even responding at all. She's probably out freaking, doing something wholesome or being nice. ..Maybe if KJ really has some spare time, though, this should be the night she takes stock of the barony and how just how these interim administrative structures are doing..
01[23:00] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <Ah. Well, none in Laguna Beach, at least.>
01[23:00] <03banana> 6To Clinton: <I'll @ you some time after midnight.>
[23:00] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <works for me>
[23:00] <03tom> 14Tommy crosses one leg over the other and sorta sinks into the chair. He has the appearance of some sort of grotesque deep-ocean fish deflating at surface-level pressure.
[23:00] <03tom> "Bhhhhh..." 14he exhales.
[23:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson types like you used to dial back when phones had buttons. <I still can't get over the cake.>
01[23:02] <03banana> 6Should she also update Deacon Saldana on the diary thing..? He did find it.. and KJ wants to see just how magic Foster's reach is. Ok, one more text and then she's getting off her ass and over to the office.
01[23:03] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <Why was there a cake?? When I got there Cavanaugh was already eating it meaningfully!>
01[23:03] <03banana> 6To the Deacon: <Hey! Is this Thomas Saldana?>
[23:06] <03tom> 14Tommy focuses his shriveled eyes on his beeping phone. He brandishes his thumbs. <ya>
01[23:08] <03banana> 6To the Deacon: <It's KJ Valentine, the hot one. I've found out some interesting things about the insane horrorshow we saw at the old Franks place.>
01[23:09] <03banana> 6To the Deacon: <Do you have Signal or Whatsapp?>
[23:09] <03Crion_> 4One upside of being alive again, and thus sweating and so on, is that Cav's been compelled to get his suits dry-cleaned again on a regular schedule like a normal human being.
[23:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: <"Bren" brought it as a barony-warming present. Then Cavanaugh ate it, because what else do you do there? It was 💯 all around.>
[23:10] <03tom> 14His responses, in sequence: <oh> <good> <no> 
[23:10] <03tom> <i guess ill dl em>
01[23:10] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <Oh my god. 🎂 -> 💰 -> 😷>
[23:11] <03Quaker> Clarabelle was distracted by something on her desk, but she brushes it aside. "No, your pants are fine. Don't worry about it. So, um..." 
[23:11] <03Quaker> "I have a favor to ask of you." 
01[23:11] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <Still, I was really really glad to figure out it wasn't Donald Bren beneath the mask.>
[23:12] <03Crion_> 4So when this meeting with the...society does occur, he'll be doing it in a freshly cleaned and pressed suit. Nice.
01[23:12] <03banana> 6To Tommy: <Ok, let me know when you've got one. Literal text messages aren't really a thing post-Snowden>
[23:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: <"At least it wasn't Donald Bren" is the silver lining for a lot of life's little miseries.>
01[23:12] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <Yeah but the problem is the times when you don't even have that.>
[23:13] <03Quaker> Cav's phone gets another message. 
[23:13] <03Quaker> Leisurely: <Are you going to the Order event tonight> 
[23:13] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <I am>
[23:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: <Yeah. You been in touch with Yuan since then?>
[23:14] <03Quaker> Leisurely: <Do you want me to come with you> 
01[23:14] <03banana> 6KJ wanders down the street, humming and texting. Here's what she's going to do, then: go over with the staff and ghouls just how this arrangement is running so far. It's been a few weeks, and there haven't been any major *issues* in feeding rights or keeping track of who passes through the area.. but could that be because they aren't keeping track well enough? Also, the ghouls probably need their fix.
01[23:15] <03banana> 6To Wilson: <We're neighbours, so I'm hoping to run into her shortly. Any particular reason?>
[23:15] <03tom> <since when are texts not a thing. were doing it right now>
[23:15] <03tom> "A favor?"
01[23:15] <03banana> 6That reminds her. To Frances: <So: Free real estate!>
[23:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <Yes, if you're feeling up to it>
01[23:16] <03banana> 6To Frances: <🎅>
[23:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: <She had a rough night.>
[23:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> <Ended well, but still.>
01[23:17] <03banana> 6To Tommy: <I think when you see one of the videos I've got you'll agree it wasn't for the delicate ears of the NSA>
[23:18] <03Quaker> Frances texts back a picture of a half dozen empty chocolate containers on her unmade bed. <:I> 
[23:18] <03tom> <im just saying> <theyre still definately a thing>
01[23:18] <03banana> 6To Frances: <This is serendipity>
01[23:19] <03banana> 6To Tommy: <Sorry, Deacon, I was using perhaps excessively-modern slang. SMS does physically exist.>
[23:19] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "I've got a pilot program that needs a pilot. It's a bit of a brainchild of mine. And I thought that choosing you would have an especially, um, symbolic meaning. That you could appreciate." 
[23:20] <03Quaker> Leisurely: <Okay. I'll be ready in a few minutes. If you could give me a ride I'd appreciate it.> 
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10When is that thing Sol invited Wilson to, anyway?
01[23:21] <03banana> 6To Frances- ok, KJ needs to actually sit down again. It's getting hard to walk and tap. She'll drop onto her own damn stoop rather than going through to the back alley. To Frances: <I have literally just been to Lindt. Do you need a refill?>
[23:22] <03Quaker> Tommy can hear the front door open, shortly followed by a crash of paper. "- of a bitch, this place is a mess." Sauer comes into the back holding a giant black matte suitcase. "I knocked over some stuff. Sorry." 
[23:23] <03tom> 14Tommy is genuinely speechless for a bit here. "...You want me to head up one of your projects? The most I ever did for you guys before is bust kneecaps and get chased out the woods by some sort of fuckin' bear."
01[23:23] <03banana> 6To Wilson, belatedly: <I'll pass on the warm fuzzies!> 6Frost is a nice guy, isn't he? It's hard to reconcile with what people used to say.
[23:23] <03tom> "I hope it's a project that can afford to get fucked up," 14he adds.
[23:25] <03Crion_> 4Cav: <Of course. I'll be over in a half hour.>
[23:26] <03Crion_> 4After checking in with Baron Lakewood one more time and telling the girls to keep an eye on the house and its new guest, Cav will set off for Leisurely's place.
[23:26] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Well, it's meant to help prevent you from getting...messed up, actually." 
[23:27] <03Quaker> Frances: <No im getting fat> 
[23:29] <03Quaker> The event is tonight, according to the email Wilson received. The Eastern Columbia building downtown. 
[23:29] <03tom> 14That gets his interest. With eyebrows raised: "Whuddaya mean?"
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: <You can't get fat because we're undead>
[23:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Any mention of a dress code, cover charge, reading list, anything like that?
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ: <This was like the #1 attraction.>
[23:31] <03Quaker> Frances: <It's a state of mind> 
[23:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10God, Wilson has no idea who's going to be there or what people are going to be doing. The last time he walked into a room this blind was the night he got introduced to Court.
[23:32] <03Quaker> There isn't a dress code, although the general crowd Solitude hangs out with means, y'know, dress up. 
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: <You can't get fat because you don't deserve it. You've got a mind gym.>
[23:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson goes to call Cora to bring the car around before he remembers he gave them the night off. Guess he's driving himself. Can't fill the flask after all.
[23:34] <03Crion_> 4Cav is dressing loud tonight: a blue tie to go with his black suit, rather than his usual matching black tie.
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's been a few months since Wilson drove, and it's been a few decades since he drove to get somewhere on purpose, but they make these cars basically idiot-proof these days and your phone will read the directions to you out loud in a patient nursemaid voice.
[23:35] <03Quaker> Leisurely's house is completely different from the last time Cav was there. All the trash has been cleaned up, for one. Leisurely greets him at the door in a sky-blue cocktail dress, her cornflower yellow hair combed out and pinned up, rather than in her usual braids. 
[23:36] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Well, in your...emphasis...you get exposed to a lot of danger. I thought that, well, you shouldn't have to be alone all the time. So, I talked to Presbyter Sauer and she said she had something that might help." 
[23:37] <03Crion_> "Good evening, Leisurely. You look fantastic." 4And her dress matches...his tie. Coincidence, or remote viewing? Best not to think about it.
[23:37] <03Quaker> Sauer clears a space for the suitcase on a desk. "How do you feel about minor outpatient surgery? Also, you don't have any fillings, do you?" 
[23:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's wearing a gently pinstriped dark blue-gray suit and his tie has some kind of diamond pattern on it. Nora had them on the right side of the closet which is the 'wear this if there are going to be people' side.
01[23:37] <03banana> 6The textstorm seems to be clearing. KJ gets up and heads inside, through the townhouse to the alley and the office. Now, who's on duy tonight..
01[23:38] <03banana> 6To tell the truth (in the privacy of her own head) she's a bit worried. These recent events have made her aware just how shitty mortal agents, ghoul or otherwise, might be at keeping track of a vampire who doesn't want to be tracked.
[23:38] <03Quaker> Leisurely beams. "Thank you. Are you planning on exhibiting yourself tonight?" She walks with him back to the car and gets in. 
[23:39] <03tom> "I uh..." 14The Deacon would blush, if he could spare it. Vitae's a bit tight after that run-in out in the canyon. 
[23:39] <03tom> "I have a few silver fillings," 14he mutters. "Why? What kind of- what are you talking about?"
[23:39] <03Crion_> 4Cav grimaces. "We'll see. I've got something planned, but the feel in the room has to be right."
[23:44] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Well...what if we could be with you, all the time?" 
[23:45] <03Quaker> Sauer lifts a scalpel. "Silver's fine. Some of the modern composite mixtures can disrupt radio frequencies if they're too close. Should be good." 
[23:47] <03Quaker> Speaking of feeling, the night overhead is cloudy. It fits with the strange mood that's settled over the city lately. It's hard to put a name to it, but...
[23:47] <03tom> "Oh man, are you going to chip me."
[23:48] <03tom> 14He follows that one up: "Oh man, you are going to chip me."
[23:48] <03Quaker> When Wilson and Cav's cars arrive, a valet ghoul either directs Nora towards parking or takes Cav's car off his hands. The building's entrance is clear of passerby, and the usual passage into the tunnel towards the basement is marked discreetly. 
[23:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson tips the ghoul and heads in. He hasn't noticed anyone yet; psyching himself up to believe that leaving the house was a good idea is giving him a sort of tunnel vision.
[23:50] <03Quaker> The massive industrial elevator takes them, in whatever order they arrive, down into the pleasant - fountained and decorated - lobby leading to the larger laboratories. For Cav, this should be familiar. For Wilson, there's a massive industrial elevator in the basement of the Eastern Columbia Building that leads to a pleasant lobby far underneath. 
[23:50] <03Quaker> Also, the signs in the lobby have...strange names on the little directory plaques. Rocketry? Botany? 
[23:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's weird. This is weird. Coming here was a mistake.
[23:51] <03Quaker> His beast seems to be very quiet, though, for once. Must be the music piped in through excellent speakers. 
[23:51] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opKK871VO0A
[23:52] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "We're not going to chip you. You're not a dog." 
[23:52] <03Quaker> Sauer: "A chip would be totally insufficient for our needs." 
[23:53] <03Crion_> 4Last time Cav was here, he was with...
[23:53] <03Crion_> 4...Whatever. They all made their choices.
[23:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Okay, okay. Classy-weird. Much better than weird-classy. Classy-weird gets you Vincent Price. Weird-classy gets you Hannibal Lecter.
[23:53] <03Crion_> 4Can't keep living with ghosts.
[23:55] <03Quaker> Does Cav go straight in to the room marked Exhibits? Or does he linger in the lobby? Leisurely seems content to follow him around as he will. 
[23:56] <03Crion_> 4He'll linger in the lobby for a few minutes, but will head into Exhibits if he doesn't run into somebody who wants to talk.
[23:56] <03tom> 14He rubs the back of his neck. It's got a pebbled texture. "So... you kinda make it sound like a chip."
[23:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Did the email say what room the meeting was in?
[23:57] <03Quaker> Speaking of the lobby, there's no one Cav will recognize, just a balding, white-bearded man who keeps checking his pocket watch. He'll bow politely when he sees them. "Visionary. Slave." 
[23:57] <03Quaker> It did not. 
[23:58] <03Quaker> KJ's ghouls report all systems running well. As it turns out, once you set up the lines of governance, there's not much hands on work to do if you just want a base level of functioning. Now, aggressive expansion and crisis management is something else...but she doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment. 
Session Time: Sun May 07 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "No. I thought you might want company, not just a knowledge that we know where you are. A...reference book and helper, that sort of thing. A radio transmitter so you can hear us, a microphone so we can hear you, and a camera so we can see what you're seeing." 
[00:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ugh. At this point Wilson starts looking for people. Who does he see first?
[00:01] <03Quaker> Before Cav can correct him, he'll notice a familiar face walk into the lobby and look around as if he's lost. 
[00:02] <03tom> 14Tommy quirks his brow and raises his phone.
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4Cav breaks into a smile.
[00:03] <03Crion_> 4To Leisurely: "I didn't know Wilson Frost was in our little group."
01[00:04] <03banana> 6Well, there's nowhere to expand to, is there? Not that the oldschool Invictus obsession with territory is really what matters. "OK. 'Gadget', over the next week I'd like you to put together a survey on the kindred who've been feeding here - we're going to take names and home territories at minimum, and whatever else they'll give you without getting hostile. Expect a lot of lies, but I'll be following up on those until people get the message."
01[00:04] <03banana> "'Quimby', I want you to look into defenses against telepathy. Beg or buy access to peoples' libraries - I've discovered that we're being surveilled in a way which may or may not be possible to prevent. And 'Claw', how are we doing on recruiting rude dudes with attitudes? Would we be prepared if a turf war suddenly broke out over Disneyland? I want to be."
[00:05] <03Quaker> Leisurely's face turns from a placid, friendly, vacant smile into a terrified, stricken grimace. She turns and walks towards the bathroom. "Um- I...You go ahead-" 
[00:05] <03Crion_> 4...
[00:05] <03Crion_> 4...Okay.
[00:06] <03Quaker> Before she gets all the way to the bathroom, she barfs into a potted plant. 
[00:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav is over there in a flash.
[00:07] <03Quaker> Sauer laughs. "Yeah, what, you're just going to have us on a call 24/7, and always have one hand full? Look, we're just going to put a couple tiny things in your head-" 
[00:08] <03tom> "I could wear a gopro," 14he adds nervously.
[00:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's unusual.
[00:09] <03Quaker> Clarabelle leans forward in a placating fashion. "Deacon, I'd like you to try it. The surgery - well, let's not even call it that. The installation will be painless. It's totally reversible. I just want you to be able to access an operator at all times. Myself and Presbyter Sauer will be on call at all hours if you need us. We want to give you a connection that we've failed to provide you so far." 
[00:10] <03Crion_> 4Cav, voice low: "Do you want to leave?"
[00:11] <03Quaker> Leisurely squats behind the plant, blocking sight of Wilson. "No, it's just..." 
[00:12] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "...Do you want me to ask Wilson to leave?"
[00:12] <03Quaker> "This is embarrassing. I was, um." She pokes her index fingers together. "No, no. You know when you know someone from work, and then you have your friends from not-work..." 
[00:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's at a loss.
[00:13] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Vaguely..."
[00:13] <03tom> 14Tommy nods along. "Okay. But I get to decide if it stays in, okay?"
[00:13] <03Quaker> Leisurely: "I was his secretary. For about forty years. That was my day job. Of course, I never did anything. But he didn't seem to notice, so..." 
[00:14] <03tom> 14Finger pistols. "Okay, so we doing this Trotsky style, orrrrrrrrr-"
[00:14] <03tom> "How cool with this I am is directly correlated with how far you have to shove it up inside me."
[00:14] <03Quaker> She looks downtrodden. "Everybody here knows me as the Visionary, but what if he thinks its...stupid..." 
[00:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav blinks rapidly. "Wait-- but--"
[00:15] <03Crion_> 4He shakes his head. "He's not going to think it's stupid."
[00:16] <03Crion_> "Frost's probably freaking out right now, too."
[00:18] <03Quaker> Sauer: "Well, the good news is that as long as you don't blush right now, we won't need anesthetic. Your nerve endings are dead, technically. Just, uh, look straight ahead." She moves to his side with some cotton balls, electronics, and a scalpel and clamps. 
03[00:18] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[00:19] <03tom> "Wow okay we're just gonna do it right here. Hoo, okay."
[00:20] <03tom> 14He balls his fists and pumps them. "Do me like a ham."
[00:21] <03Quaker> Leisurely: "It's just...this is kind of all I have, right now." She seems to realize how pathetic this sounds, and slumps over, even smaller, against the plant. 
[00:24] <03Quaker> Tommy feels a pressure against his throat. "Best not to talk for this one," says Clarabelle. Sauer's little hands move against his skin. What she's doing exactly, he can't see. In a few minutes, she goes over to the case and comes back with some suture. 
[00:25] <03Quaker> A few minutes later: "Okay, go ahead and say something." She checks a digital readout in the case. 
[00:25] <03tom> "Did you fuck up my voice?" 14he squeaks/
[00:26] <03Crion_> 4Cav recalls his first social gatherings with the partners back in Manhatten a bit too keenly. "Yeah, I know the feeling."
[00:26] <03tom> 14Tommy coughs, repeats. Clearer this time.
[00:26] <03tom> “What did you do?”
[00:27] <03Quaker> A faint green light illuminates on the display. "No," says Sauer. "It should be normal. Okay, that's working. You can talk now." She returns to his side with more equipment. "Just don't move." 
[00:28] <03tom> “Uhm.”
[00:28] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "It's a miniaturized microphone sensor that we stapled to one of your vocal cords." 
[00:28] <03tom> “Can I see what you’re doing, like get a mirror?”
[00:28] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Well, hm. No, I don't think that's a good idea, right now." 
[00:29] <03tom> “Okay now you’re scaring me.”
[00:29] <03Quaker> Sauer backs up, her hands dyed red with blood. "Yeah, just give it a moment. Also, seriously, don't move your head." 
[00:29] <03tom> “I am going to close my eyes now,” 14he says, and then does so.
[00:29] <03Quaker> Tommy feels a pressure on his ear. And then in his ear. 
[00:29] <03tom> 14Nope. Not having this.
[00:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How much of this did Wilson see as he came into the room? What does he see right now?
[00:30] <03Quaker> After a while, there's a faint pop that sounds far off in the distance, and the pressure recedes. "Okay." Sauer stands in front of the display, wiping her hands on her smock. "Yeah, that's working." 
[00:31] <03Quaker> Clarabelle explains: "That's a transmitter in your inner ear. Should be able to receive signals through rock, water, um, cloud cover..." 
[00:32] <03Quaker> Well, it's not that big of a lobby, and Leisurely didn't use obfuscate, so unless his attention was fixed elsewhere Wilson saw everything. 
[00:32] <03tom> “Does it get a signal in the Hollywood Hills?”
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Okay.
[00:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's gonna catch Cavanaugh's eye and then frown at the plant. Is she okay?
[00:33] <03Quaker> Sauer: "It should. Okay, so this one is going to feel weird. But, look, again, all your receptors are dead. No pain. Also, really, the eye doesn't have a lot of pain receptors to begin with, so even if..." She trails off. 
[00:33] <03tom> “God damn it, just do it.”
[00:33] <03tom> “FYI if I start having headaches I’m going to rip all this shit out.”
[00:33] <03Quaker> Clarabelle holds Tommy's hand. "Maybe...close your right eye. Keep the left one open, though." 
[00:34] <03tom> “Sick, am I gonna get to see you slicing into it like with the laser... knife eye surgery thing.”
[00:34] <03Quaker> Sauer lifts the scalpel, and then all he can see is a blurry combination of greys and blacks. 
[00:35] <03Quaker> "Hey, hand me that thing in the case." "The...spoon?" "Yeah." "I kind of expected it to be more...modern." "It's not like he can get an infection-" 
[00:36] <03tom> “Just spoon my brain out, kid.”
[00:38] <03Quaker> There's more uncomfortable waiting, and then Sauer stands up, wiping at his eye with some cotton wads. "Okaaayy..." 
[00:38] <03Quaker> She stands in front of the display one more time, and presses a button. Tommy's vision in his left eye comes back swiftly. He can see even better, actually. Everything looks more crisp. "Yeah, that works. See? I told you it'd be easy." 
[00:40] <03tom> 14He closes his left eye, opens his right. ”Gonna take some getting used to.”
[00:40] <03Quaker> Clarabelle turns to her computer. "Okay, so show me how to use the program." Sauer walks her through something on her desktop. "No, you sign in as operator. Make sure the connection is up first or you won't get anything." Sauer looks up. "Hey, go in the other room for a second, Tommy." 
[00:40] <03tom> “So do I look all tore up or can I just walk outta here if I want?”
[00:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10When that doesn't work Wilson will come over to the plant. That smell - she didn't throw up blood. What on earth? "Are you alright?"
[00:40] <03tom> 14He feels his face.
[00:41] <03tom> “Nonono, questions first.” 14He raises a finger. 
[00:41] <03Quaker> Leisurely waves Cav off. "Just...I'll be fine. I'm going to go into the bathroom. Meet you inside. Hello, Wilson-" She pushes past both of them and goes towards the ladies' room. 
[00:41] <03tom> “I’m gonna do what you want, but there’s a few things I need to get down first.”
[00:41] <03tom> “Can I still go through airport security?”
[00:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav watches her go.
[00:41] <03Crion_> "Well...shit."
[00:42] <03Crion_> "Evening, Baron Hollywood."
[00:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah... evening, Baron."
[00:43] <03Quaker> Clarabelle speaks into a microphone. "Testing..." Sauer corrects her. "The input's all the way down, he won't hear anything - yeah? Oh, hm. Well, I don't know. Technically it's all plastic. You *should* be fine." 
[00:43] <03tom> “Great.”
[00:43] <03tom> 14He plods over into the other room.
[00:43] <03Quaker> "You look...like yourself. Just don't submerge your head for a day or two." 
[00:43] <03tom> “Or.”
[00:44] <03Quaker> Sauer calls out from the other room. "It'll short out!" 
[00:44] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I guess this is your first time at one of these things."
[00:44] <03tom> “Okay.”
[00:44] <03Crion_> "Given, you know. The reaction."
[00:44] <03tom> “So what’ve we got, am I a cyborg now?”
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah, I got an invitation. Was that because of me?"
[00:45] <03Quaker> Suddenly, Clarabelle's voice: "Hello? Testing, one, two, three..." It's very soft, and seems to come from inside his head. "Say that again?" 
[00:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Yes and no?"
[00:45] <03tom> “Okay.”
[00:45] <03Crion_> "Leisurely was concerned you knew her in her, uh, other life."
[00:45] <03tom> 14Tommy stares at the wall. ”Can you see through my eye?”
[00:47] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "I think so. Look at something else?" 
[00:47] <03tom> 14He turns, regards another wall. ”Can I turn it off, like, when I’m on the computer...”
[00:49] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "I think there was some kind of...password...Karin, is this working? Tommy, can you look at a plant or something? All I see is wall." 
[00:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "...I see."
[00:49] <03tom> 14He turns and looks at a plant.
[00:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What the hell is going on here? Rockets, I saw earlier."
[00:50] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Okay, I can see the plant. Looks like it's working. What? Oh, okay. Tommy, there's a voice activated code on your end that can toggle this on and off. So pick a word, and I'm going to key it in right now. So, um, just say your word." 
[00:51] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "This is a...science fair for self-improvement."
[00:51] <03Crion_> "That's one way to think of it, anyway. Still not entirely sure on where they're going with the rockets. Don't seem to fit the general theme."
[00:51] <03tom> 14Tommy’s eyes boggle. One begins to drift.
[00:52] <03tom> “Crystalize.”
[00:53] <03Quaker> A soft, descending tone sounds in Tommy's ear. 
[00:54] <03Quaker> Sauer shouts through the wall. "Say it again!" 
[00:54] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I'm honestly not sure how much I'm supposed to tell you. Who's your patron?"
[00:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Do you know Sol Agnew? He invited me."
[00:54] <03tom> “I’m already regretting that choice. Seriously..tryhard.”
[00:55] <03tom> “Crystalize,” 14he mutters.
[00:55] <03Quaker> A soft, ascending tone sounds in Tommy's ear. 
[00:55] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Hello?" 
[00:55] <03tom> “Hey. Hey? Is there a way to talk without.. noise.”
[00:55] <03Crion_> 4Eesh. "We've met once or twice. He was a friend of my old boss."
[00:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The conversation we had was light on details. The thing hasn't started yet, right?"
[00:58] <03Crion_> 4He laughs. "Oh, don't worry. We'll know when it starts. I guess let's take a look at the, uh, exhibitions."
[00:58] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "You mean subvocalizing? I think so. Try murmuring. Nobody can hear the radio, at least." 
[00:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson motions for Cav to lead on.
[00:58] <03tom> 14Softly: ”Do I get a lollipop.”
[00:59] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "All I have in the office is chocolate." 
[01:00] <03tom> 14Grumbling:  ”I’ll take it.”
[01:01] <03tom> “Have I stared at this plant long enough?”
[01:02] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Yes. So, how this will work is that Presbyter Sauer and I will swap nights. Whenever you're on, we'll get a signal and then we can help you out! If you need anything...like, advice, or backup, or company..." 
[01:02] <03tom> “Don’t offer that unless you want to hear me complaining literally from dusk to dawn.”
[01:03] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Well, it means I have an excuse to do less paperwork." 
[01:05] <03tom> 14The Deacon nods.
[01:06] <03tom> “Is there a way for me to uh, tell.. if you’re watching.”
[01:07] <03tom> “I just need to make sure I look away from my Presbyter Vincent shrine for the next eight months, no biggie.”
[01:08] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Oh. Well, there's no way for me to turn it on remotely. So." She seems unsure if he's joking. 
[01:08] <03Quaker> "Just...try it out! You're all set. Take it for a test run, as it were." 
[01:09] <03tom> “Cool.”
[01:11] <03tom> 14Tommy steps out of the side-room, stumbles briefly under a wave of vertigo, rights himself, and proceeds out the door. The device is still going.
[01:11] <03tom> “Still good?”
[01:12] <03tom> “Don’t mind me, just the guy talking to himself while he takes the sidewalk. In California.”
[01:12] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: "Yep. Hold on, let me minimize your window on here...okay! Just say my name if you need anything. I'm going to get back to my usual stuff. But from now on, you'll have a guardian angel." She laughs. It's very soft and tinkling.
[01:13] <03Quaker> His phone buzzes. It's a text from Presbyter Vincent. <Thank you for trusting us with this. We won't let you down :)> 
[01:14] <03Quaker> A doorman wearing a blindfold holds the doors open for Cav as he passes through into the galleria. The first thing that hits him is the smell. 
[01:14] <03Quaker> This far down, this deep in the building, it smelled vaguely of industrial cleaner and...nothing, just the sterile unsmell of concrete and manufactured fibers. 
[01:16] <03tom> 14Does this thing take batteries? He doesn’t ask. Instead, the Nosferatu disappears into the night. For the most part, the recording reverts to a monochrome infrared rendering of alleyways and rooftops.
[01:16] <03Quaker> In this room - vast, arranged around a central display rotunda - it smells overwhelmingly of fresh soil. And underneath it, very slightly, blood. And above it, the night air. 
[01:16] <03Crion_> 4Whoa.
[01:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Huh.
[01:17] <03Quaker> If he looks up, Cav will notice stars, and the night sky, bared somehow to this depth. 
[01:17] <03Crion_> 4Well, shit.
[01:17] <03Crion_> "...the hell are they doing down here...?"
[01:22] <03Quaker> A golden plaque near the entrace sits on top of a sign. 'The Gardens of Barzakh: A presentation of applied botany created by The Eighth Master of The Sanguine Pain.'
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Created by-
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Okay.
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Okay.
[01:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This is fine.
[01:23] <03Crion_> 4Cav smiles. "Oh yeah. We all have names like that."
[01:23] <03Crion_> "Wanna hear mine?"
[01:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sure."
[01:24] <03Crion_> "'Scribe of the Carnal Void.' Don't worry, it's got nothing to do with fucking."
[01:24] <03Quaker> The gardens stretch out to cover the entire room - the central rotunda is lit with soft, trailing lights, but beyond it, the bare dirt paths extend in circular rings, unlit except by the stars and the moon. In the rows of plants, fruiting trees bear heavy yields of fruits of all kids, vines burst with flowers, and rows upon rows of bushes light up with faintly glowing fronds. 
[01:24] <03Crion_> "Think there's a number in there, too...? I'll have to ask."
[01:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Huh."
[01:25] <03Crion_> 4At least he's pretty sure it has nothing to do with fucking."
[01:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What's Foster's?"
[01:25] <03Crion_> "First Invisible Visionary of the Penultimate Void."
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eyebrows go up.
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's a good title."
[01:27] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "They're all pretty badass like that. Ruby Gilbright's running around here with 'First Initiate of the Untamed Pain.'"
[01:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "And you get those for stuff like this?"
[01:28] <03Crion_> 4He pauses. "Yep. Though this isn't the actual point, or the real project."
[01:28] <03Crion_> "This is an expression of the real project."
[01:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Which is remaking yourself."
[01:29] <03Crion_> "I'm going to have to put one together soon, myself. Was thinking about doing it tonight, but I might chicken out."
[01:29] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Yeah. You've noticed I've been Blushing recently, right? Like all the time."

[01:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson had, but he hadn't thought much of it. He mostly does that too. "Yeah."
[01:31] <03Crion_> 4Cav closes his eyes, and when he opens them again the blood has drained from his face, his skin cooling -- a corpse again.
[01:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Doesn't that dry you out?"
[01:31] <03Crion_> 4Then he closes his eyes again, and reopens them as his face takes on life once more.

[01:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Huh."
[01:32] <03Crion_> "It's on all the time. Even when I sleep."
[01:32] <03Crion_> "Two weeks ago I woke up in a cold sweat for the first time in...oh, I don't know how long."
[01:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Is that a good thing?"
[01:33] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "It's not a bad thing."
[01:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Was it hard?"
[01:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "It's not about difficulty. It's about...perception. Changing perspective. Evolving -- both biologically and, for lack of a better word, spiritually, because there isn't actually any remaining barrier between those two things for us." 4He pauses. "The Coils of the Dragon are flatly incompatible with dualism. The mind is the body."
[01:36] <03Crion_> "...I've been doing a lot of reading lately."
[01:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "The what of the dragon?"
[01:41] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Coils. Like a serpent's -- really, I guess dragons from eastern mythology work better here, not the flying lizards from Europe? Doesn't matter."
[01:41] <03Crion_> "They're...finer tools than the other powers of the blood. More permanent, though."
[01:41] <03Crion_> "Half enlightenment benchmark; half self-mutation."
[01:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Huh."
[01:45] <03Crion_> "And like you'd guess, there's no real...instruction manuals for them. You just have to pop under the hood and start tinkering, with only a vague idea of what you're trying to accomplish."
[01:46] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Which is a lot more terrifying when your only test subject is, you know. Yourself."
[01:49] <03Quaker> The people in the room can't number more than a dozen, almost all of them sitting or standing under the rotunda. 
[01:50] <03Quaker> Leisurely appears silently besides them. "Thus the externalization of his condition onto something more pliant. And less valuable." 
[01:52] <03Quaker> Towards them, walking slowly, comes Solitude Agnew, Second Architect of Sanguine Terror, Master of the Academy. 
[01:52] <03Crion_> 4Cav looks from her to Wilson and back, unsure who that was meant for.
[01:52] <03Crion_> 4Probably the point.

[22:29] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHLewcdIWlw
[22:33] <03Quaker> The Master of the Los Angeles Academy steps softly on the dirt path leading to the grand exhibition room’s entrance. In the bright moonlight falling down from the great opening in the ceiling, some far distance above, they can see him well: a man some years past late middle age, slightly bent with age, still with a head full of white hair, wearing a quiet suit that seems neither unfashionably bulky or fashionably fitting. 
[22:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hey, it's Sol.
[22:34] <03Crion_> 4Here we go.
[22:37] <03Quaker> Meanwhile, a cyborg-vampire is running around the streets of Orange County, up to….well, what is he up to, anyway? With the seeming end of the Sponger affair, Tommy has some free time. Come to think of it, it’s the first real break he’s had in months, the tempo of sorting things out for other people having kept his schedule full. 
[22:37] <03Quaker> What does he want to do? 
[22:39] <03Quaker> And is this first feeling of existential freedom liberating, or horrifying? Hm. Clarabelle must have rubbed off on him a bit, there.
[22:40] <03Quaker> Also, why is no one returning KJ’s regular jibes and jabs? It’s like all of her social contacts, normally buzzing, have gone silent. No new texts…
[22:40] <03tom> 14Tommy spends more than a little time trying to see if he, like, can spot a bunch of wires, electronics, etc. hanging in space in the desk mirror in his room beneath Soria's peublo mission. No such luck. Still, as he sits on his bed and kneads his throat, he has a moment of clarity. How is this freaking thing powered? Does it have batteries? Are they gonna have to like, put batteries 
[22:40] <03tom> 14in every few days?
[22:41] <03tom> 14What if Vincent, like, put in some sort of bomb? How would he know? It all looked like radioshack bits.
[22:41] <03Quaker> “Fourteenth Slave. Visionary.” Solitude bows to Cav and Leisurely, and then extends his hand to Wilson. “Hello, Wilson. Glad you could join us. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble finding the place.” 
[22:43] <03Quaker> Well, Tommy could ask…
[22:43] <03tom> 14That's true!
01[22:44] <03banana> 6KJ's getting up from the stoop, on her way inside to take a look at the safe when.. that's.. weird. Four people all going quiet at the same time. Shit. Shit, are they onto her? Is this a stingray - or just a sting?
01[22:44] <03banana> 6Okay the first thing here is to lock ALL the doors.
[22:44] <03Crion_> "Good evening, Architect."
[22:45] <03Quaker> The basement is a little less crowded now that Sponger has moved out. Word from the grapevine is that Bren’s legal people withdrew the accusation of assault. No official news yet, but it’s a welcome bit of gossip. 
[22:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson shakes Solitude's hand. "No, no trouble at all. I appreciate the invitation.
[22:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "
[22:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There's some remarkable work going on here."
[22:45] <03tom> 14Tommy isn't convinced. Until it's official, and probably a while after that, he's gonna remain skeptical. Too much stuff has happened for him to trust Bren's 'legal people'.
[22:46] <03tom> 14He mutters the words and looks very hard at the palm of his hand. "Hey, anyone at the computer? Do you need a computer for this? Is there a mobile app?"
01[22:47] <03banana> 6Step 2: get out a burner phone. Can KJ connect to the network without triggering any pings..? Odd, it seems to work just like her main device. So what if it's not her but them?
[22:48] <03tom> "I have questions," 14he says to nobody.
[22:48] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Hello? I’m here. Um, I don’t think there’s an app for this…what do you want to know?” 
01[22:50] <03banana> 6Step 3: Note down all the names of the people who've gone dark around the same time tonight.. and work out, later, how they're connected. It's probably just an event or dinnertime, come on.
[22:51] <03Quaker> Solitude looks back at the rows of the garden. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. I can assure you that it’s more impressive once you know what’s been done at the cellular level. But, that’s botany for you. Not my field. I just appreciate the smell of the flowers.” 
01[22:51] <03banana> 6Quelling paranoia, Baron Anaheim laughs at herself. But the whole episode, combined with this weird thing Leisurely Foster's been talking about, gives her an idea..
[22:51] <03tom> "So you have to like, sit down at your computer to help me out? What if you're like, sleeping, or something." 14He lets that hang for a bit before continuing: "I uh, you didn't put like... a bomb in me, did you?"
[22:52] <03tom> "These are probably things I should have hashed out before I let you guys put stuff in me. I don't even know how you guys did it."
01[22:53] <03banana> 6KJ received a present, last week, from a secret admirer. The money is money, the bullets she's had traced to the Wilderness Commission.. but that leaves the gun and the note, both things you *handle*. It's not only mysterious stoners who can draw out information from the Blood alone.
[22:54] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Well, I just have to have a radio signal, I think. I’m not quite up to speed on the exact mechanical details. I think it has something to do with sending tiny electronic impulses into the parts of your body that need to be used. Or…something like that.” She pauses. “A bomb?” 
01[22:54] <03banana> 6She unlocks enough doors to head over to the office and pick them up. The gun, first: ignoring ghouls who're finding out just now that there's a mysterious rifle in the box on that side of the room, KJ sits down on a table, stills herself, and wraps both hands around the long shaft on her lap
[22:55] <03tom> "You could do it, though, right? I mean, how could I tell?"
[22:57] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “Oh…I don’t really know how to make bombs. Or how to put them in people. I guess if you hear ticking, you should start to worry.” 
[22:59] <03tom> "Oh." 14He reticulates his fingers on-camera. "So you don't really... this was mostly Sauer's idea, then?"
[23:00] <03tom> "I just had this sudden panic that I was going to wake up in the middle of stealing like, a diamond or something, with you guys remotely controlling me while I'm daysleeping. That's, that's crazy right."
[23:02] <03Quaker> “I don’t think we can make you do things.” Clarabelle thinks about it. “I wanted something like this to help people who were helping us. So I asked Presbyter Sauer for her help, and she came up with this device. Devices. I guess that makes me like Steve Job!” 
[23:03] <03tom> 14'Oh man,' Tommy thinks to himself privately. 'I'm definitely gonna die'.
[23:04] <03tom> "That reminds me." 14He takes out his phone, covering a portion of his screen with his thumb while he flips through messages. "KJ had some kind of app I needed to install. I might need Sauer's help to make sure it's not some sort of... virus I guess."
[23:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What is your field? If that's not a rude question."
[23:05] <03tom> "How's this thing powered? Did Sauer say?" 14He installs the app. "Do I need to stand next to a magnet or something? Would that be bad? What if I jump in a pool?"
[23:08] <03Crion_> 4What's so special about this garden anyway? It grows in moonlight, not sunlight?
[23:09] <03Quaker> Clarabelle: “I’m not sure what it’s running on, exactly. But it’s waterproof. And magnetproof. I guess if you were around some kind of jamming device, there might be reception problems…” 
[23:09] <03tom> "Good to know, I guess."
01[23:10] <03banana> 6How did this go again? Baron Murray wasn't a very good teacher, or at least she didn't want to appear to be. On one level it comes so naturally to KJ, the shadows at her fingertips, the gun as a representation of its owner - after all, they don't kill people by themselves. On another.. she's not really sure what she's doing. Just how it feels. Maybe she really does need access to that trove of books, once Cavanaugh's free later on.
[23:12] <03tom> "Okay, well, I'm not really doing anything important, so.. I'm gonna go... do my own thing. Kay, thanks... uh bye."
01[23:13] <03banana> 6The warehouse office has people discussing trivia, movements of money and of people. A crowd is easy to shut out, unlike an individual. KJ lets their voices carry her into the barrel and through.
[23:13] <03tom> 14He sits in silence, eyes narrowed. Nothing? No voices? Okay, good. He turns to his phone.
[23:13] <03tom> <how the fucks this thing work>
[23:14] <03tom> <send>
[23:14] <03tom> <send message>
[23:14] <03Quaker> KJ’s sense of sight leaves her for a moment, and rushes into the rifle. She can hear…voices, faintly. They’re discussing some sort of…inventory order. Then, that dissolves into a smell of cordite and gunpowder, and a series of distant bangs. She can see a woman at a firing range, short brown hair and protective eyewear, making a series of perfect circles in a target…and then she sees it being placed in the duffel bag, 
[23:14] <03Quaker> along with the bullets. She can see the same woman, making a note of some kind on a clipboard. KJ can peer over her shoulder…and sees her marking a number of rifles set back into a storage system of some kind…it looks as if she’s making some sort of clandestine adjustment. 
[23:17] <03Quaker> Then, she can see the duffel bag sitting in the passenger seat of a tan Honda, next to the woman, who’s breaking the law by speaking on her phone while driving. 
01[23:19] <03banana> 6That's illegal, lady.
01[23:19] <03banana> 6Which is a crime.
[23:21] <03Quaker> “Yeah, I got it. You’ll have to give me some more time for the rest. The Commission’s a bit more relaxed about this stuff, so they won’t notice it’s missing for a day or two. Yeah. I have some idea.” A pause. “Sure. Same amount next time. I don’t know yet. She’s only got two hands. Maybe some stuff from the library. Uh huh.” Another pause. “Ok. I’ll lose this number. Let me know what the new one is when 
[23:21] <03Quaker> you want to talk.” The phone ends, the car comes to a halt, KJ sees her house outside the car’s window, the woman gets out, and the vision ends. 
01[23:22] <03banana> 6Criminality aside, KJ's taking mental note after note. Every detail of this is amazing - it's working better than before. Just a matter of practice? 
[23:22] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Psychopharmacology. Although I’m sure our unique biology makes what I do pretty unrecognizable to my counterparts in the field. The idea remains the same.” 
01[23:23] <03banana> 6So the stuff came from the Commission, alright, but someone had it delivered to KJ as a message... she's got a face to put to a name. Do they, whoever "they" are, *expect* her to be researching them? Do- hey, it's a message.
01[23:24] <03banana> 6The vision fades. Possibly for the best, but she'll be following the hell up after telling this poor guy how to send messages.
[23:24] <03tom> 14Tommy is caught in sub-menu hell.
[23:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I get the impression that the unrecognizable is this organization's stock and trade."
[23:24] <03Quaker> “Well, you have to have results. That part’s as recognizable as ever. Wilson, do you know the Fourteenth Slave? Not his christian name, but we favor discretion. I’m sure he’ll open up with his real titles if you stick around.” 
[23:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "We've met."
01[23:25] <03banana> 6KJ: <You were doing it right the first time, but not any of the subsequent times 👩‍⚕️>
01[23:25] <03banana> 6KJ: <[Accept video download?]>
[23:26] <03tom> 14He mashes that yes button.
[23:26] <03tom> <so what's this for again?
[23:26] <03tom> 14It doesn't send. He types it back up again, brackets included.
[23:27] <03tom> <so why'd you have me download this>
01[23:27] <03banana> 6The thing in the mist is about the size of a shipping container. It’s got four legs, the front two ending in massive claws. The head resembles a crow’s with beak is hanging open and a huge, bifurcated tongue lolling out, covered in thorns and dragging along the ground - crow-mockery silhouette covered in misshapen yellow eyes and beak lined with ragged teeth. After a moment, KJ's audible swearing and the video cuts out.
[23:28] <03tom> <this is real right>
01[23:28] <03banana> 6KJ: <That's #1 yeah. #2 is the code you gave me! We cracked the case.>
[23:28] <03tom> <i got hazed real bad once. someone sent me a trailer to the mist and told me i was gonna have to fight one>
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: <You were pretty high on necromancy or whatever, Mr. Saldana, but you saw the back of the car?>
[23:29] <03tom> <oh cool what was the case that was cracked>
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: <That thing is what took off our sunroof.>
[23:29] <03tom> <oh yeah i remember that. i didnt get a clear look at it>
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ: <I mean classically that would be a good thing because you're supposed to go mad if you do?>
[23:30] <03tom> <yep, it's crone bullshit>
[23:30] <03Quaker> Cav can smell the fragrance of the garden, the flowers giving off a faint, pleasant, sweet smell. He realizes after a moment that the reason it smells so pleasant is that underneath the sweetness is the metallic taste of blood. 
[23:30] <03tom> <i mean, right? thats their thing. crows and thorns.>
[23:31] <03Crion_> 4Of course.
01[23:31] <03banana> 6KJ: <Pretty much. I'd like to ask you about that some time, but here's what I mean by cracking the case 👮‍♀️🕵️‍♀️>
[23:31] <03Crion_> 4All comes back to the blood in the end.
01[23:32] <03banana> 6KJ: <The paper from the basement is actually the code to a diary which baron Laguna found **LAST** time he was at the old Franks house.>
[23:32] <03Quaker> Solitude: “Great. Although I won’t have to call you Slave for long, I’m sure, Baron. Any plans of your own to report?” 
[23:32] <03tom> <what like a coded diary>
[23:33] <03tom> <that seems like a lot of effort for very little return>
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: <That's right, by the former owner. It does but honestly>
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: <honestly>
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: <How long have you been a vampire in LA?>
01[23:33] <03banana> 6KJ: <How many sane people have you met here Mr. Saldana>
[23:33] <03tom> <six months>
[23:33] <03tom> <a few>
01[23:34] <03banana> 6KJ: <Then you're doing well I think. 💯>
[23:34] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I've made some...advances. I'm still sorting out the proper way to report them."
[23:34] <03tom> <so whats in the diary>
01[23:36] <03banana> 6KJ: <Transcriptions of ancient sun-worshippers' prayers. Tommy Franks - no relation I hope - mentioning he passed on all his research to an oldest sister in Los Padres. The man seems to have spent several decades uncovering the sort of secrets which I called classical above>
[23:37] <03Quaker> Solitude: “I don’t know how you feel about unsolicited advice. So, I’ll keep my mouth shut. Visionary, do you have a moment? There’s something I’d like to discuss with you.” 
[23:39] <03Quaker> Leisurely looks back at Cav, and then lets Solitude put his arm through hers. As they leave down another path, he inclines his head politely once more. “Please, feel free to explore and say hello, Wilson. You’re a guest here. I’d like to think this is a place where curiosity is rewarded, not punished.” 
[23:39] <03tom> <huh, okay>
[23:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'll be glad to test that out for you."
01[23:40] <03banana> 6KJ: <So I was wondering>
[23:40] <03Crion_> 4Cav waits for them to go before shaking his head. "I gotta come up with a spooky science fair project."
[23:40] <03Crion_> "If only so people stop calling me 'Slave.'"

[23:48] <03tom> <so that i cant comment on>
[23:48] <03Quaker> Cav can see that throughout the garden, some permanent displays remain in the midst of this latest project. Mostly glass cases containing books, small clay artifacts, and even a few old-looking rocket parts. The people are the most interesting part, though - there’s still a few people in the pavilion in the middle, sitting and chatting. Cav recognizes the Seventh Master of the Wild Curse, the rocketeer. He doesn’t see the 
[23:48] <03Quaker> Prince.

01[23:52] <03banana> 6KJ: <Me and Baron Laguna have a lead on some Crone research, from the diary sort of. We're hoping to check it out soon, and I bet there's information in their about their own version of the thing.>
01[23:52] <03banana> 6KJ: <Do you want to come and take a look too, see if any of it's familiar?>
[23:53] <03tom> <so u wanna see if its just the same bullshit>
[23:53] <03tom> <im not sure what official policy is on testing if gods real or not>
[23:53] <03Quaker> Wilson does, faintly. The name takes a while, but eventually comes to him, as does the the position. Maria Meza, some kind of underling-secretary working for the Prince out in Ventura. They were introduced at a party, once. 
[23:53] <03tom> <i feel like they frown on that sorta thing>
[23:53] <03tom> <obvi im into it tho>
01[23:53] <03banana> 6KJ: <Are you sure there isn't some wise old priest who'd bless you and say It is through doubt, my son, that we truly come to understand belief.?>
[23:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah, that's Maria. She's got one of those sinecures up in Ventura."
[23:54] <03tom> <like 80% of why im here is because you dont get taken apart if you ask why god needs a spaceship>
[23:55] <03tom> <but lets not advertise that ok>
01[23:55] <03banana> 6KJ: <I'm actually really interested in this.> 
01[23:55] <03banana> 6KJ: <I don't know if there are any other church people in the brilliant court who have this power and would like, talk about it or show it off, without needing you to go through circles of loyalty and stuff first>
[23:56] <03tom> <oh also i might need your help with some nerd shit at some point ok>
01[23:56] <03banana> 6KJ: <Like you said 'mystery'. But there's no mystery to their mystery, it's political not religious.>
[23:56] <03tom> <ya most of those guys are dicks to me anyway>
01[23:56] <03banana> 6KJ: <What, you want me to beat some up?>
[23:56] <03Crion_> 4Cav nods, staring at her intensely for a few moments, trying to lock that name and face together in his mind. It won't last for long, but hopefully it'll take at least until he gets some place it's socially acceptable to whip out his phone and update his notes.
[23:56] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Ventura, huh."
[23:57] <03tom> 14KJ's screen shows that Tommy is typing a message. The final output is pretty short considering how long it takes for him to formulate it: <kno anything about cyborgs?>
01[23:59] <03banana> 6This guy is way more interesting than he might've been. Pity about the face. KJ thinks for a moment about what exactly the purpose of this question might be. <I think so. Have you ever heard of a site called less wrong?>
Session Time: Sun May 14 00:00:00 2017
[00:01] <03tom> <i guess ill check it out?>
[00:01] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Lot of people here I don't recognize, but that's normal. I've been wondering how many of us there are, as a percentage of the greater Los Angeles whole, and what the power relationships are there."
[00:02] <03Crion_> "You know, the Prince is in this Order."
01[00:02] <03banana> 6KJ: <I don't know if you're talking about p-zombies or bodymodding. But either way round, I can help with tech stuff if you like- just as long as it isn't about weird ads popping up on your laptop.>
[00:02] <03tom> <idts not>
[00:03] <03tom> 14It isn't clear whether the 'd' in that was an intentional affectation or a typo.
[00:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Huh."
[00:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...I guess I'm not surprised."
01[00:03] <03banana> 6KJ: <Well I might as well put the six years in silicon valley to use. Not like my options vested>
[00:04] <03tom> <cool. idk if the sanctum knew what they were doin>
[00:04] <03tom> 14He logs off.
[00:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It'd explain how people who spend all their time on this always seem to land such easy jobs."
[00:04] <03tom> 14*can* you log off this app?
[00:05] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "And honestly, you can't well run a secret society under the bank tower without letting the boss know."
01[00:05] <03banana> 6Well, you can close it and people can see whether you're in the conversation right now, at least. KJ's paused for long enough for him to make his getaway if he wants, confused.. the Sanctum, cyborgs? Shouldn't they be more into golems?
[00:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What's his rank?"
[00:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Fourth Adept of...the Burning Hunger?"
[00:06] <03Crion_> "Yeah that sounds right."
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's standing in front of one of the displays, arms folded. "You know there's kind of a pulp aesthetic to this."
[00:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The rockets, the artifacts, the underground enchanted garden. It's a little Doc Savage."
[00:13] <03Quaker> The display says: Lecture Notes of Stefano Florenzi, c. 1765. Recovered 1977. 
[00:14] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "A little what?"
[00:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ah, I've dated myself."
[00:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "An old serial. Think of someone splitting the difference between Indiana Jones and superheros."
[00:16] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Sounds cool. Why hasn't anyone rebooted it?"
[00:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I think someone's about to announce they will."
[00:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They got that wrestler guy to play Doc Savage. Could be good."
[00:18] <03Crion_> "Who, The Rock?" 4Cav leans in and looks at the display. "Wonder how many actors and celebrities are secretly wizards."

[08:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, you did it. Beneath the Heavensward spreads a sparkling paradise, an abundance of structures and rings and geometric channels missing only a human population. And one gets the sense that actual use and occupation would just spoil things.
[08:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12A few things stick out, though, that must not have been part of the original design. Miles to your west, for instance, smoke rises and rocks tumble - some part of the Cathak forces, no doubt having survived the surge of shaping primordial energy by dint of their own essence.
[08:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Stranger and more subtle, some of your eyes are drawn to what looks like a tiny floating island just a little ways away from the blast's epicenter. Is that... that's where Xalvierre's monastery was, isn't it?
[08:09] <03Crion> 4We did it. Who knows what that means, yet.
[08:09] <03Crion> 4Oh for the love of-- "Port and below. Island."
[08:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Either way, I believe three of you are on deck while Eikichi's just wandered out of the central structure to admire his handiwork. He's currently orbited by three glass spheres, each hugged, encrusted, or otherwise partiall ensconced by metallic vitriol.
[08:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12partially*
[08:11] <03Crion> "That's Xalvierre's range."
[08:11] <03Crion> "Should I pull in?"
[08:12] <03trenchfoot_> 6Tatsuya: "Think he'll be happy to see us?"
[08:13] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Does it fuckin' matter?"
[08:13] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yo!"
[08:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's strolling between the pillars of the city, humming a tuneless tune.
[08:14] <03Crion> 4She makes herself heard, as the ship pulls up alongside the pretty boy.
[08:14] <03Crion> "How you doin'?"
[08:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10too high, can't come down
[08:15] <03Crion> 4To Blossom and Tatsuya: "One of y'all wanna go punch his shoulder?"
[08:16] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "EIKICHI! PAY ATTENTION!"
[08:16] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Thanks."
[08:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mmmmmmmmmmm?"
[08:16] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Climb on, my good dude."
[08:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks up. "Oh."
[08:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...okay."
[08:17] <03Crion> 4The Sun abides, it seems.
[08:17] <03Crion> 4She tilts the deck slightly to favor the wizard boy.
[08:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi reaches around his back and his waist, orbs flitting from his grasp like insects. "I can't find the Linchpin," 10he murmurs as he boards the Heavensward.
[08:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "How important is that?"
[08:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I guess it doesn't matter anymore."
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Those buggers are quick, and by default they orbit juuust out of arm's reach anyway. You've got other things to pay attention to, though; as you approach, it becomes clear that a roughly wedge-shaped slice of the mountain Xalvierre's refuge was built into has been preserved somehow. The sharp bit points towards the place where the Linchpin detonated, and then widens out to preserve 
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12the monastery, its rock garden, a few of the grounds around it... unfortunately, what it hasn't got is the rest of the mountain, or any visible means of support.
[08:21] <03Crion> 4Huh.
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's just floating there, and unless Eikichi replaced its mountain with something very tall, it's a ver-r-r-r-y long way down from there to actual walkable ground.
[08:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Up on the right."
[08:22] <03Crion> 4To Eikichi: "Don't bullshit me, kid."
[08:23] <03Crion> 4She pauses. "Anyone here know anyone can punch the world in front of them?"
[08:24] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I have a guess."
[08:24] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm. That's interesting."
[08:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12As you pull up beside the island, you find a slightly paler-looking Xalvierre sitting cross legged on his monastery's front porch, eyes closed. If any of you actually hop onto the tiny earthmote that his monastery has become, he opens his eyes to stare fiercely.
[08:27] <03Crion> 4Ir ain't leaving the helm.
[08:28] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya, before they land: "Well, either Xalvierre's more than what he seemed, or he's got a friend we'll have to talk to. A raksha couldn't do that."
[08:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't seem to have noticed the island yet.
[08:29] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'll put a hundred tons of ship in him if you want. Otherwise, y'all should give him time of day."
[08:30] <03Crion> "Or tell me to shove off."
[08:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Have the members of the Squared Circle anything to say to or throw at this poor guy?
[08:31] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom snaps her fingers in front of Eikichi's face a couple times. "What's wrong with you?"
[08:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi blinks: "Hmm? What?"
[08:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He looks across the Heavensward and sees the island. "Mmm."
[08:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Whatever."
[08:36] <03dammitwho> "Have you taken ice fern spores or something? Did you at least notice that he appears to have punched his way clear of the wave of chaos?"
[08:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So?"
[08:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Now he's survived and he's got the freedom to keep doing nothing of use to anyone."
[08:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Seems accurate. Curious, but not a problem. Or at least, not our problem, which is basically the same thing."
[08:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Did you want to ask him what he did?"
[08:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's right there. If he can give a straight answer you'll get it."
[08:38] <03Crion> 4Ir swings the Heavensward around, a loop then another, then drives it up alongside the island, and the meditating thing.
[08:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He probably can't, though, because raksha are useless."
[08:39] <03Crion> 4Does anyone have anything to say?
[08:40] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya just stands and waves. Bye, mysterious mountain master.
[08:41] <03Crion> 4Ir abandons the helm and walks to the edge of the ship. Puts her foot up. "You're a good man, or you try to be. That's your business. That's the pillar inside of you."
[08:42] <03Crion> 4She throws a lazy salute. "You'll be different from us if you're lucky. You'll be better than us, if you're lucky."
[08:43] <03Crion> "And if you're lucky, you'll never see us again."
[08:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's a moment as Xalvierre ruminates on this, looking down at the pebbles before him and then at you with his piercing golden eyes. He says: "...agreed."
[08:44] <03Crion> 4She pushes back; walks back to the wheel. "I didn't like you when we met," 4she says.
[08:44] <03Crion> 4Ir: "But if it means anything, I'm sorry you're there. And I'm sorry I'm here."
[08:45] <03Crion> "And that's how it is."
[08:45] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Goodbye, master."
[08:45] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That was a good strike. Stay kind, or we'll be back."
[08:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12The faerie closes his eyes again and bows his head, apparently returning to his meditations. You know, none of the nobles of the daylit court have ever demonstrated personal flight capability, and it's not like there are any of those riding birds anywhere near.
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't say anything to Xalvierre; he just sort of shrugs at the old master's little island supporting nothing and supported by nothing.
[08:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Where to now?
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Ain't my call.
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Do we have an appointment to keep?
[08:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Is the pylon working as intended?"
[08:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Good question. Anyone got essence sight going?
[08:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Gyozin will retreat and try to fortify. He's no fool."
[08:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Where are we headed?"
[08:58] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "And after that? Will they be safe here?"
[08:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No."
[08:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If the satrap remains then none of what we did matters. They're just going to keep grinding people up."
[09:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's this: they have vastly, VASTLY smaller forces than before, and fewer Dragon-Blooded to lead those forces. They can call for reinforcements, certainly, but when or even if they'll get them is unclear.
[09:00] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Then we're heading to the satrap."
[09:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12That said, it'd definitely be to this area's advantage to leave some sort of security behind - an organized and well-trained populace, a legion of demons, whatever.
[09:01] <03Crion> 4Ir can train a militia..
[09:02] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We trained the refugees in basic maneuvers, it wouldn't take long to make them a proper militia. They'll need it once the satrapy's gone."
[09:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12So is Ir going to try to bear down on the remains of Gyozin's forces? Just soar overhead to reach the center of the satrapy first?
[09:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "How many of them are even still alive?"
[09:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They're just Blooded, they can't have stared a Primordial down."
[09:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12A few of them tried...
[09:25] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Hey."
[09:25] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We're going in hot."
[09:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Looks like everything's working, but the Pylon's regenerating power really slowly. It'll be years before it gets back to working condition."
[09:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12It'll probably be days before Gyozin (or what's left of him), left to his own devices, manages to return to Dorsal Point, the de facto capital of the local Cathak Satrapy.
[09:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12Does he get there? If he does, what does he find?
[09:32] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "But it will work?"
[09:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Everything works under heaven."
[09:35] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "No... no... it's not right. There's supposed to be an air elemental in there. A big one."
[09:35] <03Crion> 4Ugh. Fine.
[09:36] <03dammitwho> "Otherwise it'll work too slowly."
[09:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gyozin's problem is that he and his people are injured, and he hasn't got a flying ship. The Heavensward sails right over his head mere hours following the blast.
[09:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ugh, is that where Garuda was?"
[09:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Squared Circle finds a Dorsal Point under tightly-wound but thinly-spread security; the laborers and slaves there are mostly kept in check by fear of the lord's return. When it's not a dragon-blooded army but a flying ship that crests the treeline and goes sailing right into the Satrapy, all hell breaks loose.
[09:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Everybody pay attention. We're about to make it count."
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12A week ago, you allowed rumors and intelligence reports to trickle here of some great religious revival/militant movement brewing in the hills, one in direct opposition to the Cathak occupation. Mostly, that did the job of convincing the Dragon-Blooded here to muster and march... but it's not like they were the only ones who heard, or imagined what might happen if such a thing were 
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12left to grow unchecked.
[09:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12So it is that you find not only a dramatically-depleted force of loyal Cathak soldiers commanded by a single Dynast, but also a populace of workers and prisoners extremely ready to pick up the nearest weapon and finally stick it to these Imperial bastards.
[09:41] <03Crion> 4Well Sun-soak me and call me a coward.
[09:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Well, we can always just put another one in there."
[09:44] <03Crion> 4It's not fun to step off a ship with a spear forged in the screaming fire of forver ago and tell every officer with a mustache and a querulous chin that their life depends on running or fighting until Hell follows with them.
[09:44] <03Crion> 4But it is what Ir did.
[09:44] <03Crion> 4And all their medals died with them.
[09:45] <03Crion> 4That was the most blood Iscariot drank, but not the best.
[09:45] <03Crion> 4And when some of them ran, she let them go.
[09:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Battle rages at least a day and night - and, unless you take firm charge and force it not to, some time after the four of you leave. Blossom's careful to make sure that a number of things of interest to you don't get smashed or burned: maps and battle plans from the greater whole of House Cathak detailing the House's other movements and Creationwide interests, sizeable sums of 
[09:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12unworked jade (mostly red and white) and silver, records of geomantic research and sorcery that was under use by the magi that Cathak had hired out.
[09:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Speaking of, you could decide what to do with those guys, as a number were imprisoned for betraying Cathak that time Eikichi and Blossom attacked 'em a while ago.
[09:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh, right.
[09:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Haha.
[09:46] <03dammitwho> 7Good for them! They get to live, and go wherever they like, which is a better outlook than their loyalist brothers had.
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10No hard feelings.
[09:47] <03Crion> 4Ir, as the night turns back to day: "And whichever of you wishes to die, step to me."
[09:47] <03Crion> "Do it."
[09:47] <03Crion> "DO IT!"
[09:47] <03Crion> 4But by now, they didn't.
[09:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12They can probably teach you some earth magic, if nothing else. Good news, incidentally - it looks like the rest of Cathak's forces are either tied up somewhere to the southwest or mustering in preparation for a civil war that Gyozin and other higher-ups are near-certain is going to happen, so it'd take reaching out for help from the rest of the Realm to rectify what you're doing here 
[09:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12right now.
[09:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Help they've assuredly got to spare.
[09:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Haha. Hahahahahaha.
[09:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12By the time the Circle's done, Dorsal Point has been burned and looted, its prisoners loosed and its occupiers exiled or killed. Whether it'll ever go back to being a fishing town and trading port is uncertain - right now, people are mostly interested in kicking it while it's down and then getting out while they can.
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Given the incredible mess you've made, it's likely Gyozin never shows his face there after going almost immediately to ground back in the mountains - he'll have to find some other way back home. What's next?
[09:49] <03Crion> 4Fishing and trading ports extract value in return for fucking bullshit.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4Fuck to Dorsal Point, and up the damn wolves.
[09:51] <03trenchfoot> 6Let's roll.
[09:51] <03Crion> 4Ir's ready to give all the people who lived here and had to suffer under it a big ol' feast, and then blast off.
[09:52] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Eikichi, can we summon an elemental big enough to get the pylon working properly again?"
[09:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, lesser elementals wouldn't do it unless we spent months packing the place with them."
[09:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The way I see it, why bother?"
[09:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Even then you'd probably need to use more advanced sorcery to fuse them all together or something even weirder.
[09:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's not like we want to give the Imperial Manse access to the place right away, is it?"
[09:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom looks out over the railing, scowling. Eventually the storm passes. "...I suppose."
[09:58] <03Crion> 4Ir lands the Heavensward out in the field, grabs a spear, and goes hunting.
[09:58] <03Crion> 4Soon enough, they're doing the damn brisket with the people.
[09:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Every night Eikichi talks to the refugees at the heart of the city of glass. Usually he's standing beneath the big statue of Blossom. Every day imps and demons hand out stacks of hand-lettered scrolls and drawings with slogans, prayers, and admonitions.
[10:01] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya works to train people in the art of fighting, if they'll have him. Ambush tactics, striking from stealth, working with whatever advantages they have; they may never have numbers over whatever Cathak forces come later, but they should be able to stand tall regardless.
[10:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12The feast Ir cooks and that the Circle holds is one that goes down in local history. It's the effective inauguration of the use of the paradise Eikichi has sculpted as a living space, the first time people treat the geometric temples and symmetrical walkways as real homes rather than temporary shelters. Following that, the sorcerer's always got crowds of eager listeners, hangers-on, 
[10:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12and worshipers, and any of the solars who find it important to pass anything down to the people of the Hedgehog can do so with ease.
[10:15] <03Crion> 4GET
[10:15] <03Crion> 4THE DAMN
[10:15] <03Crion> 4ROAST
[10:15] <03Crion> 4DONE
[10:15] <03Crion> 4And they do.
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12A sort of natural pecking order establishes itself around you, is built into the very terrain - community leaders and logistical organizers tend to set up shop in the structures at the very center of city of glass, and their immediate allies and adjutants are just below them, and so on and so forth. It's just logical.
[10:17] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom nods sternly. "It's good to see things working out."
[10:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Either way, it's not too long before the hillfolk, now free from the Realm and the depredations of faerie both, are able to hunt, fish, and gather in peace, and are excitedly spreading in earnest the philosophies you'd only vaguely gestured toward weeks ago.
[10:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12You're sure, now, that if invaders come back around these parts they'll be ambushed and murdered in short order, especially because a few local dragon-blooded (and one surviving Cathak dynast who's had a moment of clarity) will join them in the defense. The raksha, incidentally, have well and truly had their backs broken - a few mutants and monsters still boil up from the deepest 
[10:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12fens every now and again, but they simply haven't got the critical mass required to be much more dangerous than the rest of the local fauna.
[10:19] <03Crion> 4It's still hard not to feel responsible for them.
[10:20] <03Crion> 4The natives; not the raksha.
[10:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi spends a lot of the last few days in the Hedgehog giving teary-eyed hugs to people in the streets as the enormity of the change in their lives hits him again.
[10:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Perhaps the most obvious element of the society now budding within the city of glass that wasn't your idea is a rare but strongly-held reverence for the power of the skies and the ancient air dragon Garuda; she's credited for having sheltered many of the refugees through the worst of the storm, and has supposedly blessed a few women with sorcerous power.
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Well, that's nice. As long as she doesn't try to erect any unsightly rock pillars for them to periodically duck behind.
[10:23] <03Crion> 4And as long as she doesn't attempt another boarding.
[10:24] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "So, what are...?" 7Blossom tries to flick one of the orbs floating around Eikichi's head with a finger- it serenely bobs out of the way.
[10:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, if they did they'd surely at least be in symmetrical positions relative to the center of the city.
[10:24] <03Crion> 4But frankly, that's fine. Garuda's a step up from her previous figureheads: you can put forward an argument without touching the Wyld.
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi basically ignores the spheres now. "What are what?"
[10:28] <03Crion> 4Ir's at the helm of the Heavensward now, ready to head out. "Eh?"
[10:29] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "The spheres that are floating around your head. Don't play games."
[10:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh."
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "These are the reconstituted body of She Who Lives In Her Name, who tore herself apart to deny that which she loved best about Creation to the gods and their champions."
[10:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, a small part. Thousands of these spheres. She took three of them and used them to- well, you saw."
[10:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Are we ready to go?"
[10:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Gloria and Ligier gathered the shards and molded them into the Linchpin. These shards of glass were at the root of its power. But the principle was always there to reassert their original nature, which... I guess destroyed the Linchpin itself."
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya, to Ir: "Let's fly."
[10:37] <03Crion> 4Ir throws him a wink.
[10:37] <03Crion> 4Time to go.
[10:39] <03dammitwho> 7She frowns. "They're doing a more complete job of shaping your thoughts in accordance with their nature."
[10:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What's their nature?"
[10:43] <03dammitwho> "Precision, hierarchy, order, and incredible spite."
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's eyes widen.
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Blossom...!"
[10:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "When we get rid of these, I'm still going to love you."
[10:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Don't worry."
[10:44] <03dammitwho> "Wgh-- what-!"
[10:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi kisses her on the cheek. "Come on! Let's go."
[10:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Yeah!
[10:47] <03dammitwho> 7How does he keep doing that--
[10:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's weeks later, probably, that the Squared Circle is ready to cast off and fly on. If Gyozin and any of his allies survived the detonation of the Linchpin, they haven't been seen - they must have really gone to ground, used some kind of magic to flee the area unseen. They were certainly smart to - the Realm won't be taking this place back any time soon.
[10:48] <03dammitwho> 7Let's go find Nexus!
[10:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Its heading set, the Squared Circle sails southwest through the Threshold's skies.
[10:49] <03Crion> 4Ir flies on, of course. They're so cute.
[10:50] <03trenchfoot> 6Nice.
[10:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12The weather gets warmer and warmer and the vegetation gets greener and greener. Early in your trip, the clouds swirl alarmingly around you and distant, furry shapes peek at you from over rain clouds, but you're left alone as soon as you're recognized.
[10:58] <03Crion> 4Ir spends time at the helm, in her room, in the distillery, or down with Errant. The Heavensward gets where it needs to go.
[10:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12After about a week of travel, you cross water - not one of the many small creeks and other waterways, but a massive body of water that can barely be seen across by the human eye. This is the River of Tears, flowing north out of the Yanaze, and it's dotted with skiffs, barges, and other trading vessels.
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi holds his breath.
[10:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12If your maps are correct, then there'll be another branch of it a little farther south... yep, there it is... and, right beyond that, the tomb-city of Sijan, the first major metropolis you'll be flying straight over unless you want to course-correct.
[10:59] <03Crion> 4Here's a question: should we pretend to be an actual boat?
[11:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12I'm not 100% sure you can; the Heavensward's got sails extending from its underside and they wouldn't do too well with actual water.
[11:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12However, it would be a good idea to consider how you'll be traveling and presenting yourselves. The eastern threshold is densely populated, dotted with strongholds of both the Immaculate faith and the Realm proper, and generally teeming with powers that might have things to say or even do about the arrival of a circle of Solar Exalted.
[11:01] <03Crion> 4Hrrrm.
[11:04] <03dammitwho> "We might want to avoid calling too much attention at first. Shouldn't be difficult, with cloud cover."
[11:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "What do we do when we get closer? We can't hide behind clouds forever."
[11:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We can get Morgana to set us up in the interim."
[11:05] <03dammitwho> "Whom?"
[11:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "She's not wrong."
[11:06] <03Crion> "Flying ship. Gotta make a choice about that."
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Morgana runs the Velvet Room. It's the organization Tatsuya and I work for."
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Sijan, Eikichi and Tatsuya know, is a city ruled by the ancestor cult; morticians, embalmers, and necromancers (the small-n sort, who know the proper rituals by which to contact the dead) have pride of place there, and while the city itself is not a Shadowland or anything of the sort, it's whispered that gates to the underworld can be found in its lowest reaches.
[11:07] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Well, where should I park this damn thing?"
[11:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's nothing you particularly need there, but it is a big city through which you might contact the Room or just gather news, and also, conceivably, someone there might know what to do with your excavated Niobraran blood phylactery who isn't themselves a deathlord or deathlord's servant.
[11:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12You could just fly on, though. Nexus is close!
[11:08] <03dammitwho> "Well, what do you think?" 7She gestures down at Sijan.
[11:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "If we're willing to lay over in Sijan, the funeral city, we can get more information and put a detailed plan together there. Otherwise we should just press on to Nexus and see what's what on the ground there."
[11:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well... either way, I've got some explaining to do."
[11:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I haven't really spoken to Morgana since I was Chosen."
[11:09] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "If we're looking to keep a low profile, flying straight into Nexus doesn't sound like the way to do it... I can get Tatsuya ready to go to the Velvet Room from here, I guess?"
[11:09] <03trenchfoot> 13Here being Sijan, not "the ship," to clarify.
[11:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Is he sure? I could cover for him."
[11:10] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I love a good funeral."
[11:10] <03Crion> 4Ir: "But I'm guessing they don't have a damn landing pad for us. Lemme find a good plateau."
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12The good news is that for the most part, news in Creation travels more slowly than the Heavensward does, so you can show up in a flying ship of distinct make and not immediately find yourselves contending with your past reputations. It'll catch up, though.
[11:11] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "We're sure. Um. Wow, it sounds really weird when I put it like that."
[11:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Our past reputations are great.
[11:11] <03trenchfoot> 13Perhaps... too great.
[11:13] <03Crion> 4Nah, they're pretty great. We just don't need people poking around while we do our thing.
[11:17] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, to Ying: "It makes sense to me."
[11:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I didn't say it was wrong! Just, a reminder of how weird my life is."
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway there's not really a subtle place to park a flying ship nearby Sijan, which is on pretty flat terrain and bounded on most sides by branches of the River of Tears.
[11:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We should probably go the diplomatic route rather than trying to hide the Heavensward."
[11:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12But... maybe...
[11:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's a long shot, but if you wait a few hours for that fog bank, dip behind those trees... yes, Ir can nestle the Heavensward in a handy hollow right in the middle of some nearby forest, though it'd give the lot of you a several hours' walk to Sijan proper and might mean that a random hunter or explorer finds your ship at some point down the line.
[11:27] <03Crion> 4Walking is good and fine.
[11:27] <03Crion> 4Also, Ir and Blossom will be riding.
[11:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi has a little cloud to sit on.
[11:28] <03Crion> 4But stashing the Heavensward in a crevasse is basically what they should have been doing from the jump. So it's not the worst thing in the world when they make sure that everything is copacetic before they head out.
[11:39] <03@Ferrinus> 12Soooo the forest you're using for cover is on the outer edge of a huge wooded shadowland called the Black Chase, but you're in its outermost peripheries which are safely within the sunlit world and, in general, the dead around Sijan are known to be very well-behaved as befits the city's stellar reputation.
[11:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Now, when you say stellar-
[11:40] <03Crion> 4Well. Great.
[11:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12So it is that your actual landing and disembarking is pretty uneventful. If you're particularly uncertain you may want to leave Sondok or just some blood apes back to guard the vessel, but generally your approach to Sijan is calm and uneventful.
[11:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We've got enough erymanthoi to leave some behind to guard the ship.
[11:42] <03Crion> "Lady and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are descending to the forest floor. Please do not touch the animals, understand the monoliths, or speak with the dead. Thank you and good luck."
[11:42] <03Crion> 4And then Ir brings the heavenly ship in.
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's still a little grouchy about the fastening belt Blossom put on Eikichi's chair for when the ship lands.
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10But he claps all the same.
[11:44] <03dammitwho> 7Safety first.
[11:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Of greatest interest is the city itself. The closer you get to it, the more you become convinced that it's an actual ghost town - there are great structures of marble and granite and basalt stretching out before you, but no sound or motion at all visible on or between them. That's not a surprise to either Eikichi or Blossom - they know that the portion of Sijan that's above ground 
[11:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12is for the dead, not the living, and that mortals only go there on specified nights to keep things clean and give offerings.
[11:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Populated Sijan is underground, and sure enough you find an archway and down-sloping tunnel build neatly into the hillside so as not to distract from the majesty of the tombs and sepulchers directly before you.
[11:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom sniffs dismissively.
[11:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Sijan's famous for its funereal prowess throughout all the Scavenger Lands. Members of the the Funeral Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers ('the Funeary Order' for short) are in call all over the hundred kingdoms, for they know how best to hold funerals, arrange graves, and give offerings so as to forestall any kind of vengeance from beyond the grave - crucial in a land so 
[11:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12riven by wars, betrayals, and murders as this one. As well, anyone who's anyone comes to Sijan to die, or at the very least arranges to be buried there afterward, because they're sure to be granted expansive stature and grave goods so as to render them veritable emperors and empresses of the next world.
[11:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom and Eikichi know that the influence of the enigmatic deathlords is, surprisingly enough, not felt in Sijan to great degree - most of those nearby have some interest in it, to be sure, and the "Walker in Darkness" is rumored to even have a secret embassy there, but no underworld power rules the place. They needn't be wary of attack by Reckoning's like - at least, not as a 
[11:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12matter of course.
[11:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wasn't thinking about that at all. You can tell because it hasn't poisoned his mood all day.
[11:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, you've soon walked down into the darkness to find yourselves at a toll booth/waystation sort of area at the mouth of a long tunnel. There are black-clad guards and a man in a heavy robe with silver bracer on his wrists who'd like to know who you are, what brings you to Sijan, how long you'll be staying, if you're aware of the city's laws and if you have your entrance fees at 
[11:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12the ready.
[11:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12(Luminous crystals light the area)
[11:51] <03Crion> 4Uh huh.
[11:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12What're we lookin' at here, anyway? Is the Circle just in full regalia, with silver spears and circling orbs and red jade armor and suchlike plainly visible?
[11:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Well...
[11:53] <03Crion> 4Ir's in street clothes, with a weird coiled set of strange jewelry curled around her arms.
[11:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's there in his long plated jacket, surrounded by pieces of a demon queen. He doesn't seem to be visibly armed, though, and there's no sign of any demons in his wake.
[11:56] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom doesn't really have regalia as such, which is a distressing oversight.
[11:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well she's got really intimidating bangs.
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10*clears throat*
[11:59] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's got a long coat that hides his armor but no visible weapons. Nothing fantastical, either. We keep it strictly normal here.
[11:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, the receptionist, so to speak, blanches at your approach, but it's not visible since he's in long cowled robes and furthermore kind of standing back in a little booth thing. Nonetheless, you espy a runner heading down the hall as you approach, and more guards approach from out of the dark as you speak to him.
[11:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12Who are you? What brings you here?
[12:01] <03Crion> 4Well, shit.
[12:01] <03Crion> 4Someone other than Ir better answer that, before Ir answers that.
[12:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We're the Squared Circle. We're here to build a road to paradise."
[12:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There. That was easy.
[12:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Sijan replies... next week.
[12:03] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't laugh. She smiles.

[08:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12The squared circle waits patiently at the opening to a long, crystal-lit tunnel as the administration of Sijan, City of Tombs, tries to figure out what to do about them.
[08:23] <03dammitwho> "Eventually," 7Blossom adds. "At the moment we're passing through on our way to Nexus."
[08:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Though if we've got time I'd like to see you pull some brains out of corpses' noses."
[08:24] <03Crion> 4Ir fidgets. Feels weird not wearing armor anymore, but good. She misses Errant, though.
[08:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Some ten or fifteen minutes pass as runners dart out of sight, messages are passed up the chain of command, and so on. In that time, just the usual trio of black-clad guards and the robed man working the entrance checkpoint are there to address you. In a dry voice, he says "Any... any particular business in the city?"
[08:24] <03Crion> 4At the moment, Iscariot is a sequence of strange bangles hidden by her sleeves.
[08:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Actually, let me revise that a bit. They have sent for someone, but there's not an enormous rush or palpable terror among the people in front of you; only one of you really looks the part of an exalt, god, demon prince, or other extremely worrisome visitor that one might run across in the age of sorrows's eastern threshold.
[08:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Same question, though; they'd like to know if you have something specific you need to do or someone you're looking to talk to. When Eikichi makes his remark, the man at the front carefully writes it down.
[08:29] <03trenchfoot> 6The thief stays behind Eikichi and the rest, keeping an eye out for persons of interest that mean to do them ill. Not that he's expecting an attack here and now, but it's good to stay in practice.
[08:30] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "If you can read this, you're stupid."
[08:30] <03Crion> 4Simple furs now, a greatboar top over hill-elk leathers. She's cut her hair a bit too. Stays near Eikichi and Blossom but makes it clear its them the Sijan authorities should be talking to.
[08:31] <03Crion> 4Sigh.
[08:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12The receptionist/bureaucrat carefully makes quillstroke after quillstroke, then pauses and frowns down at his paper, then slightly more slowly finishes writing. "...names?"
[08:32] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't understand any of this anyway.
[08:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Just as well, probably.
[08:33] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Eikichi Sho."
[08:33] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Excessively Righteous Blossom."
[08:33] <03Crion> 4She can tell when people's names are being said, though. "Ir."
[08:33] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya snickers at the man's reaction, but it vanishes quickly. "Tatsuya."
[08:34] <03Crion> 4They've probably outrun word of their own deeds such that this is fine.
[08:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12By the time two of you have spoken, the receptionist's mouth has gone dry and his quill, having managed '-ssively Right-' has stopped writing and simply started shaking.
[08:34] <03Crion> 4...
[08:34] <03Crion> 4Sigh.
[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Robed receptionist: "B-but..."
[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Robed receptionist: "...what happened to Bergsveinn?"
[08:35] <03Crion> 4Ir blinks.
[08:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Robed receptionist: "Wait, wait, don't spoil me-"
[08:35] <03Crion> 4All she caught was the name, but that was definitely--
[08:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi clears his throat.
[08:35] <03trenchfoot> 6Too soon.
[08:36] <03Crion> 4Ir turns. In Skytongue: "Why does he know Berg's name."
[08:36] <03Crion> "Eikichi Sho. Why does the man know Berg's name."
[08:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's a good question, I didn't think copies would circulate that fast."
[08:37] <03Crion> 4Her eyes get very, very narrow.
[08:37] <03Crion> "Copies of what."
[08:38] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I talked about this! I'm writing a history of the Squared Circle."
[08:38] <03Crion> "You didn't say you'd published it!"
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Receptionist: "But wait wait wait. The five- the four of you. Are they real? I didn't actually - I mean, my daughter... oh, hell, I need to summon more important people, don't I."
[08:38] <03Crion> "I thought it was like, a diary!"
[08:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "When did you even have the chance?"
[08:39] <03Crion> "Oh my Sun."
[08:39] <03Crion> 4To Tatsuya: "What has he written about me."
[08:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12Now a runner's been sent up the tunnel at a dead sprint, and the receptionist has had to redo all his official notes on your arrival, names, and stated intentions on the basis of the last one having been spoiled by sweaty palms.
[08:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Let's discuss this privately, yeah? And later."
[08:42] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "...yeah. Good things, though. But yes."
[08:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, actually, right before he does that, he'd better actually confirm things for himself. So, outright, you are asked: "You're... you're the ones from the the the history? Chosen of the.... sun?"
[08:43] <03dammitwho> "Yes." 7Blossom replies firmly.
[08:43] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't like how that sounds. Sun, she hopes he didn't put Samer in there by name...she likes Samer, sure, but that was, you know, a temporary thing. Not something she intended to have like, ballads written about.
[08:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Receptionist: "My, my daughter, you see, a rich friend - advanced copy..."
[08:43] <03Crion> 4This word is the same across languages: "AUGH!"
[08:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Receptionist: "Oh, gods above."
[08:43] <03Crion> 4Ir throws up her hands, then crosses her arms.
[08:44] <03dammitwho> 7She glances at Ir curiously for a second.
[08:44] <03Crion> 4...It'll be good for business back in Crystal, though...
[08:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Look, we've had a long trip and it's wearing on all of us. We just want to get to Nexus as peaceably as possible."
[08:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12You're left waiting longer, the guards becoming more nervous by the minute. Eventually, a small delegation of guardsmen headed by another robed figure with silver cuffs appears; this new man bows low before beckoning you, and you're taken a little ways down the tunnel before taking an immediate right through a hidden door that leads into some kind of opulent welcoming chamber. It's 
[08:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12lit in shades of purple by chunks of luminescent quartz set into the walls and furnished with lots of dark wood and velvet.
[08:46] <03Crion> 4In Skytongue: "If we're already known here, tell them I can do a show tonight for our lodging or for passes or whatever if that's what they want."
[08:46] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi reflexively checks for mist oozing in through cracks in the walls.
[08:46] <03Crion> "...Make sure they know it's a music show."
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Ir reflexively coaxes Iscariot together along her arms. Just in case.
[08:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12A much better-composed man in funereal robes waits there for you, along with servants ready to wave fans and peel grapes and suchlike. "Your excellencies! As a representative of the Funeral Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers, I welcome you to the city of Sijan. You may refer to me as Doplen."
[08:49] <03Crion> 4...She's gonna have to learn this language, isn't she.
[08:49] <03Crion> 4Nice robes, though.
[08:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Your arrival is unexpected! But welcomed! Buuuut. Well, possibly not welcomed. The, ah... just to make sure I will not shortly be handing down a reprimand for the ages, the four of you do claim to be traveling solar anathema?"
[08:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Oh, is - you're from the north, yes? Is Riverspeak acceptable?"
[08:50] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Can you manage Low Realm? We're mostly not from around here."
[08:51] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya quietly translates for Ir. Hell, he had to learn the languages the other way around, might as well return the favor.
[08:51] <03trenchfoot> 6That works, too, I guess.
[08:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Not High...? Ah, it's not for me to - just a moment." 12He whispers to a servant, who ducks out a back door.
[08:52] <03Crion> 4Easier to learn if you just take the plunge in, but she won't object to Low Realm for this bit.
[08:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12A few awkward moments pass before an old, robed interpreter shuffles into the room. Henceforth your conversation moves back and forth through an intermediary.
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen, in Riverspeak: "Ahem! Yes, as I was saying... you're chosen of the Sun? As claimed by my subordinate?" 12Old woman, in Low Realm: "He asks if you're really sun-demons."
[08:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Yes."
[08:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen, via interpreter: "This might be gauche, but... prove it? As gently as your state allows."
[08:54] <03Crion> 4Ir rolls her eyes and her forehead flashes with the mark of the Chosen of the Sun.
[08:54] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom will do the same, except not roll her eyes.
[08:55] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya does the same, including the eyeroll.
[08:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12There are soft gasps and other intakes of breath around the room. The interpreter scowls to herself and averts her eyes. Doplen maintains a steely composure except that the speed with which he wrings and flexes his hands and wrist approximately triples.
[08:56] <03Crion> 4As the sign flashes, the air around her body explodes in a sunburst and radiant, shining mail coils from the light itself around her body. Into her hand springs a moonsilver spear, bangles no longer, and the room burns with power.
[08:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Hooo boy. Well. Ahem. Right." 12Interpreter, in Low Realm: "He's thinking."
[08:56] <03VoxPVoxD> 10As Eikichi's brow lights up, the spheres surrounding him begin to spin behind his back, dancing among each other to draw elaborate hypotrochoids. "Can we be sure of that?"
[08:56] <03Crion> 4She holds it for five seconds, then waves her hand. The armor fades away, like a cloud had passed overhead. The spear shudders, then slithers back up her sleeves.
[08:57] <03Crion> 4To Eikichi: "Be polite."
[08:58] <03Crion> "We can't both be the rude one."
[08:58] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You and your niche protection. Fiiiine."
[08:59] <03@Ferrinus> 12After clearing his throat, Doplen proceeds. "It is... like this. The Funeral Order, not the Immaculate Order, rules here, and the concern of this great city is smooth passage to the land of the dead, not, as such, the affairs of the living."
[08:59] <03Crion> 4That sounds like...good news.
[09:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "That said, open hospitality to, frankly, anathema is a troublesome prospect in times such as these. We've little need for Dragon-Blooded monks to walk our halls, thanks to our arts, but no one likes demons, do they? Not to put too fine a point on it."
[09:02] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi turns to look in the empty space in the room behind them before saying, "Oh, certainly not."
[09:02] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Well, we're not demons."
[09:02] <03Crion> 4Ir: "People like us, so."
[09:02] <03Crion> "Y'know. Make your own call on that one."
[09:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Our citizens might fret, and our neighboring states object, to our welcoming you with open arms, you see? At the same time, I and by extension my order would never wish to give offense, or to stand athwart your path through the East."
[09:04] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So you want us to not do what we just did for the rest of our time here."
[09:04] <03Crion> "I can manage that."
[09:04] <03Crion> "We're just passing through, aren't we?"
[09:04] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "As I've said, we're not staying. Your citizens and neighboring states can be quite reasonably asked what they expect you to do, given the circumstances."
[09:05] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "That's the idea, yeah. Just a nice, calm stop, where nothing bad happens and everything's fine."
[09:05] <03Crion> 4Would be nice for once.
[09:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Ahh, yes, not to put too fine a point on it. It'd be better for all involved if, as far as most knew, we were just playing host to... a little-known scavenger lord, say, or a demigod and their servants."
[09:05] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Really, the biggest obstacle to our leaving here quickly is standing around dissembling."
[09:05] <03Crion> 4Ir: "That's what I dressed for."
[09:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom looks irritable. "If we must put up the thin pretense that we are a God-Blood and his entourage, then so be it."
[09:06] <03Crion> 4In Skytongue: "Just tell the man you'll limit yourself to behaving like a mortal primadonna and let's go."
[09:07] <03Crion> 4That's to Eikichi.
[09:07] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya shrugs. "Whatever lets you sleep at night, my dude."
[09:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "Well... well, then, that's all right. Isn't it? The Order will happily provide you lodgings, guide you around the city, or see to any other needs you may have. If anything arises, and especially if you'll be needing to stay here on a longer basis, please let me or one of my intermediaries know as soon as convenient."
[09:08] <03Crion> 4Ir will smile and nod, and the smile's less tight than she thought it'd be.
[09:08] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's fine. Could you bring me some grapes, please?"
[09:08] <03Crion> 4It's good to be off the boat for awhile; around people.
[09:08] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Let me go get our packhorse, oh lord of mine."
[09:08] <03Crion> "I'm sure that's where I left them."
[09:09] <03Crion> 4Poor Sondok, though. Stuck on the ship...
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Doplen: "At once!" 12Things proceed smoothly from here, unless you're of a mind to toss a shaft in the gears. There's ample room in the tunnels for Errant, Eikichi gets all the snacks he wants, and the lot of you are escorted by one of Doplen's own functionaries through the entrance tunnel and into Sijan proper.
[09:11] <03Crion> 4Ir feels even better when reunited with Errant. He's enjoying the new climate too, though it's a bit warmer down here -- she might need to get him a shearing. She'll play it by ear. "You've certainly gotten shaggy, though," 4she mutters in his ear as they walk. The warhorse snorts defensively.
[09:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12The city opens out beneath you as you leave the entrance tunnel, revealing a great underground complex of hewn, crystal-lit stone. Catwalks stretch from stalactite-tower to stalactite-tower and processions wind their way around the twisting streets and alleys below.
[09:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We splitting up here?"
[09:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12You're led to what is apparently a high-end hostel, the Dragon's Tooth, and given the equivalent of a penthouse suite - the chambers at the exact bottom of a great column of hanging stone, all well-apportioned with all manner of luxuries. If you pay attention to the words being exchanged by your guide and the proprietor and the local guards and so on, you get the idea that this is 
[09:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12meant to look like a sleazy but not actually illegal favor being done for a high up city official who's basically treating some personal friends.
[09:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12Soon you've got your chambers to yourselves. Outside you can hear the bustle of market stalls, the proclamations of town criers about shift changes and rewards offered for any information about a rash of defiled tombs, the occasional murmur of prayer.
[09:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12If anyone decides to check, they find it's late afternoon.
[09:22] <03dammitwho> "Well! This is interesting. Eikichi, Tatsuya, have you been to Sijan before?"
[09:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Farthest South I've ever been. Farthest East, too."
[09:22] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Just once. Graverobbing wasn't really my style."
[09:23] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The bureaucrats were a lot ruder last time."
[09:23] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So they're all about the dead people here, huh?"
[09:23] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Guessing that leads to problems with Shadowlands."
[09:23] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Oh, yeah. The guy had an excellent sneer when he spat out 'street rat,' like it was a phrase he invented. Different guy this time. Maybe someone finally broke."
[09:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Sijan is a city of ritual necromancy. They bind and cajole the dead specifically to ease the formation of ghosts and Shadowlands."
[09:24] <03VoxPVoxD> "That said there's one not far away. Big spooky forest."
[09:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10And we're closer than ever to Thorns.
[09:25] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Well that's...cool."
[09:25] <03Crion> "Not that it bothers me or anything. Just, you know. Lot of Shadowlands recently. Lot of weird places in general."
[09:26] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Nexus is weird, but it's weird in mostly human ways."
[09:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Pneuma's like that. I can handle that."
[09:26] <03Crion> "So the Heavensward needs what, a permit to dock?"
[09:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "There's probably an agent somewhere in Sijan we can buy a permit from and show to a dockmaster in Nexus. Or something like that."
[09:28] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Yeah. I'm - not clear on how that'd work, but there's gotta be some kind of process in place, right?"
[09:28] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Sounds like something I should at least be there for, though, y'know. Language barrier. Blossom?"
[09:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, here's how it works. Unlike Sijan, Nexus is free of top-down bureaucratic control by any governing body, and all the space there is completely free for productive beings to use as they see fit. Specifically, every inch of the city is privately owned, and there are specific cartels that jointly control all the city's available docking space.
[09:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12However, a conundrum arises, since generally docking space is taken to be the edges of the river flowing through the city. When you think about it...
[09:30] <03Crion> 4Seems like we could just rent a plot of land and park there.
[09:31] <03Crion> 4Say we're building a three-story building there. Say, oh, 120 twenty paces by 30 or so.
[09:31] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I'll bet I can find the right person."
[09:32] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Damn straight."
[09:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12...when you think about it, there's no way that literally all the air in Nexus is under private control, and a web of agreements and contracts ensure that like, most streets and things are free for anybody to walk around on so long as no one obstructs traffic. You don't actually need a special dock of your own - you could just moor yourselves sufficiently high in the air and 
[09:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12stretch a rope ladder down to street level, and who's to say you're in their territory?
[09:32] <03Crion> 4Can the Heavensward even masquerade as a freshwater ship for the purposes of docking the usual way at Nexus?
[09:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Now, if you want a proper dock such that teams of workmen can unload stuff from your ship or do repairs or whatever, you'll probably want to rent space near the roof of a building that itself is on or near the waterside, at which point Eikichi and Tatsuya can probably point you to a few smart choices.
[09:33] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "While you two make those arrangements, Tatsuya and I should probably..."
[09:34] <03Crion> "...?"
[09:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's been a while since we talked to our boss."
[09:35] <03VoxPVoxD> "A while a while."
[09:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Guessing if you thought you needed company, you'd ask. Right?"
[09:36] <03trenchfoot> 6He nods. "Probably too long. But, hell, it's been strange times."
[09:36] <03Crion> 4She glances from one of the boys to the other.
[09:36] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah, we'll be fine."
[09:36] <03Crion> 4After a moment she nods, and manages to only let the worry briefly flash across her face. "Sounds good, then."
[09:36] <03Crion> "Meet back here?"
[09:38] <03trenchfoot> 6Another nod. "We'll be back by tonight. Should be able to leave tomorrow morning if everything goes as planned."
[09:38] <03Crion> 4Ir pauses. "And if you're not back by then. Where should we start looking?"
[09:38] <03Crion> "...I'm not having another Crystal."
[09:39] <03dammitwho> "Hey, Tatsuya's going with him this time!"
[09:39] <03Crion> "Not what I meant."
[09:39] <03Crion> "Not who I meant."
[09:39] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi affects a weird voice. "'This place exists between dream and reality, between mind and matter.'"
[09:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...So we have to get high?"
[09:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Couldn't hurt."
[09:42] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Mostly just wander around through backalleys and sidestreets. Keep trying to find us, and you'll know the door when you see it."
[09:42] <03Crion> 4Ir nods uncertainly. "Okay."
[09:44] <03Crion> "Well, be safe."
[09:44] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We'll do Tatsuya's best."
[09:44] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I resemble that remark."
[09:45] <03Crion> 4Ir's ready to go when Blossom is.
[09:46] <03dammitwho> "Hmm. I suppose we start by asking our hosts whom to go to."
[09:48] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Sounds good to me. You want me pretending to be a bodyguard or a handmaid?"
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Velvet Room is easy to find in any thriving metropolis, even one that's underground, whose primary import is corpses, and whose primary export is funeral services. Tatsuya and Eikichi need simply wander the right way, look for intersections of a certain shape, and so on. It's getting towards the evening when they finally slip between two walls and find themselves in the foyer of 
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12the mysterious paradimensional thieves' guild and contraband clearing house they've worked for since Eikichi was mortal.
[09:52] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Last time Eikichi came in here, he wasn't glowing and clad in jade and orbited by a fragment of a Yozi.
[09:53] <03trenchfoot> 6Last time Tatsuya was here... no, he actually looked pretty similar. Although he was returning from a job, then, not looking to pick another one up.
[09:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12As usual, it's a long, low room lit by colored, heatless torches - purplish blue today - which shifts along its length from waiting room to a series of what look like shop counters to a high table at the end staffed by a hunched, hobgoblin-looking man and a statuesque woman.
[09:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Whichever suits your interest." 7Now then. Blossom would like to speak to a manager.
[09:54] <03Crion> 4Ir shrugs. It was kind of a trick question. She doesn't know shit about being a handmaid.
[09:54] <03Crion> 4But she'll opt against being visibly armed, for now.
[09:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's a thin man wrapped head to toe in black sitting in one of the chairs in the foyer/waiting area of the Velvet Room, and on the chair next to him is a glowing golden egg. Up ahead, someone in a long brown cloak is negotiating with one of the shadowy apparitions that serve as clerks or shopkeeps, and the main desk up ahead doesn't seem to be serving anybody so you're free to 
[09:55] <03@Ferrinus> 12walk right up.
[09:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom need wait less than a minute before a servant appears. A manager?
[09:57] <03dammitwho> "I would like to speak to the person responsible for airship docking permits in Nexus. Quickly, if you please."
[09:57] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya will stroll right up, after a glance over to Eikichi. Everything's looking pretty normal in here, and there weren't huge alarms that buzzed at their appearance, so...?
[10:02] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Old reflex compels Eikichi to just stand cheerily behind Tatsuya while Tatsuya conducts business.
[10:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, this poor tea delivery woman doesn't know at all, but she can pass the message on, and her immediate superior can pass that message on, and so on and so forth. Soon Blossom and Ir find themselves being led along Sijan's streets by a minor functionary in the funeral order, traveling deeper and deeper into the markets and then stopping at and entering a squat-looking ziggurat 
[10:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12which, it must be said, is emblazoned with the symbol of the Guild.
[10:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12They've got the most robust inter-citystate trading infrastructure, after all. "An airship dock? An airship dock? Hmm. Difficult. Difficult. But, for a modest fee..."
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Ir's shed her boarskin short cloak, wearing just leather slacks and a sleeveless tunic now. Iscariot's gone from a set of bangles into a particularly ornate belt.
[10:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, I assume that Eikichi and Tatsuya both mosey up on to the main desk. "Welcome... to the velvoh it's you.'
[10:08] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Is that a bad oh-it's-you or a good oh-it's-you?
[10:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's a neutral one; he recognizes he doesn't need to give you the whole schpiel. You're peered at through some spectacles. "Been a little while, hasn't it? Not that we're not appreciative of the intelligence delivered. Saved us some embarassment."
[10:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Nameless pointy-eared gnomic guy: "Looking for further work?"
[10:11] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We're going to be in Nexus and the River Province for the forseeable."
[10:11] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Sure. We're looking to head into Nexus soon, aside from checking in; plus, wanted to prove that we're still alive after, what, a month away?" 6He turns to Eikichi. "Has it been a month?"
[10:11] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Since when?"
[10:12] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Last time? There was the two weeks since Hedgehog, but... it would've been, like, mid-Crystal."
[10:13] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh that was almost three months ago."
[10:13] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Shit."
[10:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "The River Province! Oh, excellent, excellent. Such a waste of your talents to leave you in the north. It's so much more lively along the river!"
[10:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "And Nexus in specific? My oh my. There's the big score there, of course, I'm required to remind you of it at every chance." 12He means an outstanding request for the mask of the emissary - no one knows who's asking for it, but the reward is astronomical and, of course, it's never been collected on.
[10:15] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom smiles pleasantly at the Guildsman, secure in the knowledge that they are both aware that the number of functional airships in Creation can be counted on one hand, that any airship docks have sat idle for a thousand years, and that procuring the use of one is as simple as contacting the owners thereof and asking them 'would you like some money'.
[10:16] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'll keep that in mind. What else is out there?"
[10:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "But beyond that we've any number of contracts and requests befitting your stature. Although, of course, all the really juicy ones are, you know. Part of the free for all." 12That's something else the two of you know. Strictly speaking, the Velvet Room never honors or prosecutes contracts against itself or its own operatives. It won't tell the askers as much, of course - 
[10:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12it's just that if someone demands, say, Tatsuya's magical belt, they'll be left waiting indefinitely and politely told that there've been no takers.
[10:17] <03Crion> 4Ir brought Errant with her, and isn't particularly interested in anyone who has problems with that. For his part, Errant is graceful and sure-footed, and far smarter than your average horse in terms of not walking into three-foot high fences, trying to eat other people's property or freaking out at a random trivial, common sound. She'd been very picky with him, and he'd grown into 
[10:17] <03Crion> 4the role of her battle-partner over the years.
[10:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12However, the underworld of Nexus churns with such intensity that anyone who does more than nip at the peripheries becomes eligible for payback, whoever they are, even if they're Velvet operatives.
[10:20] <03Crion> 4To Blossom, during a lull in their endeavor: "So who owns an airship dock these days, anyway?"
[10:21] <03dammitwho> "Who knows? A destitute family who have been maintaining it for a millenium, and are about to be extremely surprised?"
[10:21] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs. "And relatively rich."
[10:22] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So it's safe to say we've got our pick of open contracts, yeah?"
[10:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom's entirely right, and that's why it's the job of this guildsman to make it seem as though what Blossom's looking for either literally doesn't exist or is cast under a nigh-sorcerous veil of secrecy, to make it seem as this intermediary is doing backbreakingly difficult labor in order to uncover fantastic secrets on Blossom's behalf rather than wedging himself into her path 
[10:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12and refusing to move but for a hefty bribe.
[10:25] <03Crion> 4Ir would love to have a little conversation with him about that -- surely he knows Low Realm; she certainly does -- but Blossom's got this under control.
[10:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12He can't manage it, and in the course of a series of leading questions, legal challenges, and repeated refrains of 'oh, come off it' or its regional equivalent, Blossom is able to learn enough about the most viable and well-maintained airship dock that she becomes convinced she doesn't need so much as a messenger from these people.
[10:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12She can just call this meeting off, stroll back outside, and use sorcery to get into direct contact with the people she needs. They're not under any kind of contract that prevents it.
[10:26] <03Crion> 4Should probably tip him at least, though.
[10:26] <03Crion> 4Not for the information, but so he doesn't make it a priority to tell other people what it was they were asking about.
[10:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12Velvet room gnome: "Absolutely! I'll just fetch my files here..." 12Some paper shuffling and thumb licking follow.
[10:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Especially anything on me, Tatsuya, Excessively Righteous Blossom, or Ir."
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "How far afield do you care to travel? The axe of Typhon is to be found either in Thorns or the next meeting of the Confederation, for instance. We would very much like one of Lookshy's Soulbreaker Orbs... besides the Mask, a Nexus contract that won't toss you directly into the shark tanks calls for the last intact essence core at the heart of Firewander... ...say, where are 
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> you presently? I don't believe I heard you, if you told me." 
[10:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12He raises his eyebrows at Eikichi's immediate suggestion. "Ah! Well. I... suppose... since you ask..." 12He gives Morgana a shifty look, which she returns coolly.
[10:30] <03Crion> 4If Blossom doesn't, Ir will kick the guy a reasonable pittance from her own funds -- not enough for the information, most certainly, not even near enough; just for his time. These things slip the Mistress's mind, she'll say knowingly in Low Realm.
[10:30] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "They wouldn't try it. Right?" 6Wait, he got all shifty. "Seriously?"
[10:31] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I think we're done here. Thank you for your time." 7She hands a bag over the Guildsman's desk. It doesn't clink like money, and Ir can tell even from where she's standing that it smells delicious.
[10:31] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We're spending the night in Sijan before we go to Nexus."
[10:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "...there is, it must be said, an outstanding request for- Spite's Linchpin, I believe it is called? A certain wrackstaff that appears to be carved of green jade."
[10:31] <03Crion> 4Ah. Nice.
[10:31] <03Crion> 4Nevermind all that, then.
[10:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12He coughs. "Or a particular moonsilver six-string. Quite a high price for each!"
[10:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi breathes in through his teeth. "Oooh, ouch. I'm afraid that staff doesn't exist anymore."
[10:32] <03dammitwho> 7Bribing Guildsmen is delicate, she'll explain to Ir after they leave. They have very good accounting, and the higher-ups always demand a taste. But bureaucrats everywhere are always hungry. That's why bank lunch hours seem to take so long.
[10:32] <03VoxPVoxD> "I'll take the contract on the six-string, though."
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12The gnome looks between Eikichi and Tatsuya for any sign of a mocking grin or similar.
[10:34] <03Crion> 4Ir blinks and nods. "You know, that makes sense. Wow."
[10:34] <03Crion> "...So what did you give him, and can I have the recipe?"
[10:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "Ah, if you mean to simply - I mean, we know that's an associate of yours. Standard protections apply."
[10:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "But Sijan, you say? How do you feel about graverobbing, either of you?"
[10:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Whose grave?"
[10:36] <03dammitwho> "Just some steamed pork buns from that cart we passed. We can go back and ask if you want."
[10:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Let's do, something smelled new in there."
[10:37] <03Crion> 4AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF PORK BUNS LATER:
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya purses his lips, but says nothing about the six-string contract.
[10:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I think they've blended the pork with lamb, and spiced it with...a sort of cinnamon, and I think I taste curry powder in there, but it's a bit different. I like it."
[10:39] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "Why, the recently-deceased master of the Funeral Order. They've been buried with a powerful thaumaturgic ritual object, the Scarab of Investiture. A distant client wants it for themselves - and it must be retrieved before it's spent all of its power on its current beneficiary."
[10:40] <03Crion> 4She makes a mental note to try and make some once she gets her hands on fresh ingredients. "So are we good to go?"
[10:41] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Might be tricky to swing before we leave." 6He says it more to Eikichi than to the gnome.
[10:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah, and, what if we went through one city without ruining anything."
[10:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I'll have to send a message and do the actual negotiations, but that can happen any time, even after we leave. Feel like seeing the sights? Heaven knows Eikichi and Tatsuya won't be back before we are."
[10:42] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Hell yeah. There's something I've been wondering about this place."
[10:42] <03Crion> "It's the city of the dead, right? So, lots of embalming fluids. Preservatives, you know. That stuff."
[10:42] <03Crion> 4She grins. "They've got to have some crazy liquor."
[10:43] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "If things gets ruined without us starting it, we'll take that out of spite. Deal?"
[10:44] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "See, this is what happens when the two with good sense go out. Things get done."
[10:45] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Damn straight. You want to alternate? A round at a bar, then we go see a sight. Then repeat."
[10:46] <03Crion> "Should keep us active and sober while still getting to taste what's on offer."
[10:46] <03dammitwho> "Good plan."
[10:49] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Alright, so, first..." 4First they should decide on what sights they want to see, then find a bar around there. Makes the most sense that way. What's the first landmark that jumps out? Maybe something they saw walking around?
[10:54] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wrinkles his nose. "Ehhh. Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh."
[10:56] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What, is there some awful curse on it? Spite's a pretty powerful motivator."
[10:56] <03Crion> 4Well, closest and most obvious are the Five Arms of Horssis. They're hard to miss; Blossom and Ir walked right past them on their way towards this bureaucrat's office. They're not actually arms, just pillars made of a strange black stone, inlaid with white lines of what looks like...quartz? Some hard, cloudy white stone.
[10:57] <03Crion> 4They're kind of cordoned off in their own little park area, though there's little green and verdant around here.
[10:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, it's just a lot of work to fuck over one specific guy."
[10:58] <03Crion> 4You can tell they're the Five Arms of Horssis, of course, because that's what the sign says on the black, twisting metal gate that encloses their small plaza.
[10:58] <03Crion> 4At least that's what Ir thinks it says.
[10:58] <03Crion> 4The gate's open... "We're allowed to like...go in, right?"
[10:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "No curse to speak of! Well, not on the item itself. No doubt the strongest magics the Sijanese can muster guard it." 12Those aren't very strong magics, though; mostly it's stuff that'll sic ghosts on you.
[10:58] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Fair. My thirst for hypothetical revenge is sated."
[11:00] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Yes." 7Beg forgiveness instead of asking permission, et cetera.
[11:00] <03Crion> 4Ir pauses on the threshold. It's either both of them, or--well, that solves that.
[11:00] <03dammitwho> "Who is Horssis, anyway?"
[11:01] <03Crion> 4Ir gives her a look. "I should be asking you. I haven't been in a history class since I was like, ten."
[11:01] <03Crion> "Is it a person, or...?"
[11:02] <03Crion> "Maybe there's a plaque or something."
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12The velvet room receptionist gnome guy: "Anyway, that's all I have for you at the moment. Let me know if you're interested in any of those - and if you want the scarab, move quickly, as it's worth more the earlier we get it!"
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "Otherwise, make sure to check in if you wind up in Nexus."
[11:06] <03trenchfoot> 6After a pause, Tatsuya offers: "I'm interested in that essence core contract. I mean, heck, it's on the way. You got any intel I oughtta know?"
[11:07] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Oh, here we are. Horssis, the Dragon-Blooded hero who slew five rebellious salt gods - that's these pillars, I assume - who attempted to overthrow Sijan in league with forces from the shadowlands."
[11:07] <03Crion> "Wait, what? Salt?"
[11:08] <03dammitwho> "Right. Salt gods. Notoriously cantankerous."
[11:08] <03Crion> 4Ir frowns. "I guess...yeah, that's what the white rock is, huh."
[11:09] <03Crion> 4Then she peers closer, reaches out and plucks a tiny chip of the black material off too.
[11:09] <03Crion> "Holy shit! Black salt."
[11:09] <03Crion> "Probably best not used for cooking, but..."
[11:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "The core... well, the district of Firewander erupted into a largely uninhabitable Wyld zone when, in some past calamity, the high-energy magical infrastructure there was damaged or breached somehow. I think. Wasn't there."
[11:10] <03Crion> 4She gets a strange smile on her face and grabs Blossom's arm. "C'mon, let's find a bar."
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "We're now informed that essence fluctuations throughout the area suggest that almost all, rather than all, of the First Age wonders there must have vented their combined power to cause the Wyld breach. Something orderly remains in there and there's a lot of jade for anyone who can produce it."
[11:11] <03dammitwho> "Yeah!"
[11:11] <03Crion> 4That's pretty easy: The Last Chance Tableau has a rickety white front porch, swinging old-style doors and smell of a converted funeral parlor. It's early enough in the day that it's almost empty when they walk in.
[11:12] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Huh. I'll take a look."
[11:12] <03Crion> 4The tender has a shaved head and bleached white skin. Her eyes are strangely pale, too, as she looks them up and down. "What'll it be?"
[11:12] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Something local."
[11:13] <03Crion> 4The tender doesn't blink. "Local. Uh huh. Ever had Rigor before?"
[11:13] <03dammitwho> "Nope!"
[11:13] <03Crion> 4Ir: "What is it?"
[11:14] <03Crion> 4The tender still doesn't blink. "Single-malt formaldehyde."
[11:14] <03Crion> 4Ir stares back for a moment. "What's...formald--"
[11:15] <03Crion> 4The pale woman rolls her eyes. "A joke. Rigor's made by distilling grave apples -- they're like regular apples, except they grow in the dirt like a root."
[11:15] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Oh hell yes."
[11:15] <03Crion> "Two shots."
[11:16] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Coming up."
[11:17] <03Crion> 4She pours them straight in front of the two of them out of a thin, long-necked matte black bottle. The liquor itself is clear and smells like apples mixed with some kind of medicine.
[11:18] <03dammitwho> "Down the hatch." 7Blossom takes it in one go. Is that a good idea?
[11:18] <03Crion> 4Depends. Does Blossom do shots often?
[11:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "Excellent. Is that a no on the scarab...?"
[11:18] <03Crion> 4It's not...too much worse than the grosser stuff teens drink to try and impress each other.
[11:19] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah."
[11:19] <03dammitwho> 7She doesn't do shots often, but it's not been that long since she was a teen drinking gross stuff to impress people.
[11:20] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya nods, as well. "Yeah, nah."
[11:20] <03Crion> "Down the hatch." 4Before she does hers, Ir drops that little chip of black salt into the liquor, and then it's bottom's up.
[11:21] <03Crion> 4Holy shit that tastes horrible.
[11:22] <03Crion> 4She feels her stomach twist horribly and, for a brief moment, fears she's made a terrible mistake in eating something she chipped off an ancient statue in a city of the dead -- but she's the Chosen of the Sun, and her stomach wins that fight easy.
[11:22] <03dammitwho> "Hahaha did you just drink that?!"
[11:22] <03Crion> "Hell yes I just drank that. And it was a terrible fucking idea."
[11:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Gnome: "Farewell, then, from the velvet room!"
[11:22] <03Crion> 4She covers up a burp.
[11:23] <03Crion> "Damn if that doesn't do it, though. We'll have to buy a bottle before we go." 4She pays the tender and they head out.
[11:26] <03Crion> 4Before they leave Ir asks the pale woman, "Let's say we're looking to see the sights here and we can take care of ourselves. Any suggestions on where to go next?"
[11:26] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Once outside: "So now what?"
[11:26] <03Crion> 4And the tender just says, "Doom Stairs."
[11:26] <03Crion> "What?"
[11:27] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Head outside and keep walking. You'll reach the Doom Stairs."
[11:27] <03Crion> "..."
[11:27] <03Crion> 4She takes the coin and disappears into the back.
[11:27] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Well. We've got some shopping to do." 6He eyes the door. "But first. The six-string?"
[11:27] <03Crion> 4Once outside: "So...Doom Stairs?"
[11:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I was thinking about trying to reverse-engineer who put the contract out."
[11:28] <03VoxPVoxD> "Probably too much work."
[11:29] <03dammitwho> "We have to see those."
[11:30] <03trenchfoot> 6There's an incremental relaxation visible in his shoulders. "Worth a check. Especially if the other thing on the agenda is wandering into another Wyld-blasted hellscape."
[11:31] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I mean, absolutely, but how are we supposed to--" 4Ir stops talking and her eyebrows shoot up. She points down the road behind Blossom. At the corner there is a simple sign, white letters on dark grey background, that reads DOOM STAIRS, with an arrow pointing left.
[11:31] <03Crion> "Was...was that there before?"
[11:31] <03Crion> 4Surely, surely they would have noticed a big sign saying 'DOOM STAIRS.'
[11:31] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Firewander's probably one of the nicer parts of Nexus."
[11:31] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "You wanna get drinks? I bet if we get fucking shithammered we'll bring something way more fun back than Ir and Blossom can manage."
[11:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well... why don't we start with getting drunk and see what stupid shit we can talk each other into after that."
[11:32] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Dude yes."
[11:33] <03Crion> 4When they follow the DOOM STAIRS sign, however, they find it leads them to another, identical DOOM STAIRS sign, pointing down a different road. No one seems to find anything strange about this. This second DOOM STAIRS sign leads to a third, then a fourth, then a fifth and a sixth, and they eventually find themselves deep in the old town (it's all old in Sijan, but this feels older 
[11:33] <03Crion> 4somehow). The city has a way of getting very quiet and empty when you're not paying attention, and Ir realizes with a start that they haven't seen anyone since two DOOM STAIRS---> ago.
[11:33] <03trenchfoot> "Seriously though. They're gonna get like, a permit for an airship." 6He affects an accent that literally no one has. "'Oh, we have obtained, an permit for the sky boat, and we are free to leave now.'"
[11:33] <03Crion> 4But maybe that's fine, because they've just arrived at a staircase.
[11:34] <03dammitwho> "Finally!"
[11:34] <03Crion> 4It's a spiral staircase around a central pillar, and it stretches up to the ceiling of the underground tomb city and then through it.
[11:34] <03Crion> 4Once again, there's no one to tell them they can't...
[11:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Race you up."
[11:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I wonder what the most sugary drink they mix in Sijan is."
[11:35] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom nods sternly. "You're on."
[11:36] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya sniffs. "I bet it tastes really good and also gets me blasted. Winning."
[11:36] <03Crion> 4Ir's moving as soon as "You're" leaves Blossom's mouth.
[11:38] <03dammitwho> 7Ha! Blossom spent her childhood racing other children up and down mountainsides.
[11:40] <03Crion> 4Aw, dammit--
[11:41] <03trenchfoot> 6Hours later, Tatsuya stumbles out of some bar he forgot to check the name of before he got in there. He's stopped pretending to be Eikichi's bodyguard-slash-retainer two bars ago; they've just been on the full-on road to Good Times, together, the way the gods intended. "We gotta, we gotta go shopping," 6he says, slurring and stumbling. "You gotta get Blossom something."
[11:42] <03Crion> 4Ir's so caught up in trying to beat Blossom it takes a second to register when the staircase emerges from the tunnel climbing straight up -- not onto the surface, but into some underground cavern. The walls fall away from them, and it's hard to tell how big the room is: a couple hundred paces across, or a half-league, or more -- infinite blackness. At the very top, Blossom is waiting 
[11:42] <03Crion> 4for her on the small, square platform that ends this strange pillar-staircase.
[11:43] <03dammitwho> "This doesn't seem like doom to me."
[11:43] <03Crion> 4The platform is smooth, plain, maybe ten by ten, and completely empty save a small, round stand with a sign on it, which simply read: PLEASE RESPECT THE BOUNDS
[11:43] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's constantly pulling his hair out of his own face. "But I dunno WHAT to buy her..."
[11:44] <03Crion> 4Ir opens her mouth to say something, and then the shadows turn -- and the room around them lights up with a scene. They stand above some city, Ir can't tell which, and below them Ir can see an invading army breaking down the walls, streaming through the holes and widening them, then pouring in to sack the now-burning metropole.
[11:44] <03Crion> "What the--"
[11:45] <03VoxPVoxD> "Hi Blossom. I got you this piece of funeral jewelery. Or hi Blossom, I got you this really fancy sausage and no I didn't notice the charcuterie was connected to the crematorium."
[11:45] <03Crion> 4Even the platform beneath them seems to have vanished. The two are standing on firm air.
[11:46] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "You can't spell funeral jewelry without fun. Or jewelry. It's super good! And who doesn't like a good sandwich?"
[11:47] <03trenchfoot> "Tell you what. We start hitting shops. And we start getting stuff. That way you get multiple chances to miss, and you can leave it to sober you to sort out the actual winners. Deal?"
[11:47] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No consequences until tomorrow?"
[11:47] <03Crion> "What is this? Have we been--what city is that, even?" 4It's not Sijan or Crystal, or Pneuma...
[11:47] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Abso fucking lutely."
[11:48] <03VoxPVoxD> "That's all you ever have to say to me."
[11:48] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Oh! This is some long-abandoned sorcerous working! The city looks like..."
[11:49] <03dammitwho> 7The mischief in her voice vanishes as a shadow like that of a mountain looms over the city, walls, army and all. "...Thorns."
[11:50] <03Crion> "Thorns? But--" 4Ir steps forward to try and get a better view -- just a little bit further forward -- and almost goes plunging off the platform as the whole scene abruptly vanishes and they're once again in a dark cavern atop a white stone platform.
[11:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12She can tell it's Thorns, because the city's on a cliff's edge, facing the sea, and the first thing that happens is an enormous arm reaches up over the cliff's edge to slam down onto the city's buildings and dig its fingers down into the roads and pavilions.
[11:51] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya draws himself up to his full height and looks abruptly serious. He claps twice and gestures meaningfully. "Abso fucking lutely." 6He even gets the full thing out before breaking out into giggles. "Hee hee! Oh, hee hee hee!"
[11:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Then a second, then a gigantic, misshapen corpse is pulling itself over the side, and tiny bodies are spilling down from it- but you don't get the chance to watch much more.
[11:51] <03dammitwho> 7It's only from this perspective, really, that they could see almost the whole thing at once. A rotting behemoth that almost resembles a man, with scaffolding of wood and black marble built around and through the necrotic flesh.
[11:52] <03Crion> 4There's a horrible noise from above that sounds like some mixture of a moan and a sigh, and a hideous long, thin, spider-leg -- but too jointed to be a spider's leg -- descends from the darkness...
[11:52] <03Crion> 4...and gently taps the sign.
[11:52] <03Crion> "Uh." 4Ir takes a few big steps back from the ledge.
[11:53] <03Crion> 4The leg-thing disappears up into the darkness just as quickly as it had come, and Thorns returns.
[11:53] <03dammitwho> "Eh... we should, go..."
[11:53] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yyyyeah."
[11:54] <03Crion> 4The scene in Thorns plays out a few minutes more, but there's nothing more significant to be learned, and soon they're back downstairs.
[11:54] <03Crion> 4Once they step off the staircase, when they turn around, they'll find a blank white wall covering where they had just been standing.
[11:55] <03Crion> "We're getting two shots this time."
[11:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10There's actually not that many places still open this late, and some of those that remain shutter their doors when the angelic sorcerer comes strolling singsong down the street. "Walks beside me~ walks on by~ gets me to the church on time~"
[11:59] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eventually he goes into three shops and comes out with four bags - one big, one small, and one damp.
[11:59] <03VoxPVoxD> *10two small
[12:00] <03trenchfoot> 6The ones that don't shutter to the voice alone, they might to the accompaniment. "modern love, doot do doot doot, modern love,"
[12:00] <03Crion> 4There seem to be people around now, and they find their way to the Coffin's-Nail, which isn't a terribly imaginative name for a watering hole in the tomb city -- but it's also the third or fourth Coffin's-Nail they've passed today. Are they all owned by the same people?
[12:01] <03Crion> 4This tender's a bit more normal -- biggish dude who looks bored, wearing an apron, nods at them when they enter while perfectly pouring an ale without looking at it.
[12:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12Even odds that it's a franchise or that there are subtle cultural cues you aren't picking up on which render them all distinct.
[12:02] <03Crion> 4Ir drops heavily onto a stool in front of the bar. "Weirdest shit just happened."
[12:02] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Evening, ladies."
[12:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's actually a messenger from the Funeral Order waiting for the Squared Circle at the Circle's lodgings, wheneve the Circle gets back... but they might be waiting a good long while.
[12:03] <03dammitwho> "Whatcha got?"
[12:03] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya's hype-man esque encouragement of Eikichi's purchases might be unappreciated by the shopkeeps that are still open, but he is at this point too intoxicated to care. And hopefully Eikichi's right there with him.
[12:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wouldn't have cared sober, frankly.
[12:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10But he is incredibly not.
[12:04] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Foreign? Red wodka, white wodka, such-brandy, all five of the Nexus rails, and some agincardi. Domestic, it's Rigor, Gull, or the Mastodon."
[12:05] <03Crion> 4Ir: "What's Gull?"
[12:05] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Beer. Got cinnamon in it."
[12:05] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "We should, we should get back. They're prob'ly waiting for us. What time is it?"
[12:05] <03Crion> 4Ir: "And, uh...The Mastodon?"
[12:05] <03Crion> 4Tender shrugs. "Dunno."
[12:05] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You don't know."
[12:06] <03dammitwho> "That's what we want."
[12:06] <03Crion> 4Tender: "Brewer keeps the recipe secret. Kicks hard."
[12:06] <03Crion> 4He nods and flips up two glasses.
[12:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Also, uh. There's a staircase across the--"
[12:07] <03Crion> 4He doesn't look up. "Ain't no staircase."
[12:07] <03Crion> 4He pours The Mastodon for them out of a large, smooth vial.
[12:07] <03Crion> 4It looks like...blue milk.
[12:08] <03Crion> 4Ir: "But we--"
[12:08] <03Crion> 4Tender: "This the first bar you been to tonight, ladies?"
[12:09] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...No."
[12:09] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "They're either still out or already in bed. Either way, I got this bottle of green stuff, you drink it strained with sugar. Anise and wormwood. Probably start in on that when we get back upstairs."
[12:09] <03VoxPVoxD> "I hate that thing where you feel yourself getting sober before you fall asleep."
[12:09] <03Crion> 4Tender: "You tip your last tender well?"
[12:09] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yes?"
[12:10] <03Crion> 4Tender nods wearily. "That's the best you can do about it, then."
[12:10] <03Crion> 4He puts the two glasses in front of them. "On the house. Compliments of the White Lady."
[12:11] <03Crion> 4...Well then. Ir picks up her drink with some slight dread. The liquid doesn't seem to move right in the glass.
[12:12] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "I'm, I guess I'm probably gonna have to deal with that, 'cause for fuckin' hells I'm not dealing with the full hangover." 6He pauses. "What should I give Ying in exchange for dealing with this monster hangover?"
[12:12] <03Crion> 4Ir glances over at Blossom. Bottoms up?
[12:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Tabs are being kept on at least one member of the squared circle, but fearsome and busy as the lot of you are, the authorities of Sijan don't dare to interrupt you. So it is that you'll probably hear Sijan's one petition for you, and decide whether or not to act on it, next week.
[12:13] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Bloody mary mix."
[12:15] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Noooooo. She drinks - wow, this is weird, but it's something that I know anyway - she doesn't drink mixed anything? Why would she...?"
[12:15] <03trenchfoot> "That's just gross."
[12:16] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh. In that case, raw egg, Western Isle sauce, and red pepper."
[12:16] <03dammitwho> 7She's already drinking. COWARDS DIE IN SHAME
[12:17] <03Crion> 4Hooooooooooooo
[12:17] <03Crion> 4oh god that's hideous
[12:17] <03Crion> 4oh
[12:17] <03Crion> 4oh sun
[12:17] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Did I just drink metal?"
[12:17] <03Crion> 4The tender shrugs.
[12:18] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "What is - what is that. I like an egg. But that feels like a trick."
[12:18] <03Crion> 4Ir slams the glass down on the bar. "Then get me and my friend here a pair of Gulls."
[12:19] <03Crion> "And two more shots."
[12:20] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi waves his hand putting on an air of diffident aristocracy. "Old Imperial hangover cure. The Western Isle sauce gives it its color. The raw egg makes it nutritious. The red pepper gives it its bite. I've found it extremely refreshing after a late evening." 10A bell tolls. "An extremely late evening."
[12:21] <03Crion> 4SOME HOURS LATER:
[12:22] <03Crion> 4Errant nickers and sighs as he arrives in front of the hostel bearing two young woman, one of whom is hugging his neck and lightly dozing.
[12:22] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya nods, seriously. "I'll get those. And. And a fancy notepad. To write an apology in." 6He wavers on his feet, unsteady.
[12:23] <03dammitwho> 7Can Blossom carry Ir into the room without waking her up?
[12:23] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi puts a hand on Tatsuya's shoulder. Eikichi's balance is fine, which is remarkable since he keeps falling asleep while standing.
[12:24] <03Crion> 4Ir will start awake as soon as she's touched, tensing and almost flinching away.
[12:24] <03Crion> "Whuh--"
[12:24] <03Crion> "Oh."
[12:25] <03Crion> "Whuh-oh!" 4Here she pretty much falls off the horse.
[12:25] <03Crion> 4Errant bends and moves his weight, though, keeping her in the saddle for an instant before he gently dumps her off.
[12:25] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Let's roll." 6It's all he can do not to literally roll along the ground on his way to his destination(s); he ends the evening back in their room, Eikichi along with him, before he faceplants into a mattress and begins snoring heavily.
[12:26] <03Crion> "Ah, shit." 4Ir stands. "Thought you were some'n else."
[12:26] <03trenchfoot> 6He starts awake after a few moments; no time to sleep, when there's blame to shift. Ying won't like this.
[12:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's sitting on the foot of Tatsuya's bed until he starts awake. "Make sure she sleeps on her side, yeah?"
[12:27] <03dammitwho> "C'mon. They'll. They'll be here soon." 7Blossom's faith that Eikichi and Tatsuya will spend way more time dallying than them is absolute.
[12:28] <03Crion> "Okay. Right. Okay." 4Ir half turns to wave over her shoulder. "Errant, you--you know where the barn is. The tomb-barn. Tombarn."
[12:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Then Eikichi takes his bags and goes and sits in the foyer. The damp one's attracting flies now.
[12:28] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Wh- yeah. Yeah." 6He nods, seriously. "My word is bonds."
[12:28] <03Crion> 4The horse chuffs and shakes his head, making sure they get inside before wandering over to his own bedding.
[12:29] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya shuffles off to a corner and begins meditating; it's strange to do this in a more public space than his own room, but it has to be done. At least, if consequences are to be dodged.
[12:30] <03Crion> 4Ir will half-support, half-be-supported-by Blossom as they make their way inside.
[12:30] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No more The Mastodon."
[12:30] <03Crion> "No more a'that."
[12:31] <03dammitwho> "It wasn't great."
[12:31] <03Crion> "It was poison."
[12:31] <03Crion> "I--I think it was lit'r'ly poison."
[12:31] <03dammitwho> 7If Eikichi's in the foyer, then he sees them first.
[12:32] <03VoxPVoxD> "14buy her furs and pretty things-" 10Eikichi looks up. "Gooooooooooood evening everybody."
[12:33] <03Crion> "Aaaand how."
[12:33] <03Crion> "Word of--word of advice." 4Ir straightens up. "If they ask you to drink The Mastodon. Do not drink The Mastodon."
[12:34] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That sounds like such good advice."
[12:34] <03Crion> "The best advice--is lived."
[12:34] <03Crion> "Or...the opposite of lived?"
[12:35] <03Crion> "Or the opposite of advice."
[12:35] <03dammitwho> "I think there was mold in it. COWARDS DIE IN SHAME"
[12:35] <03Crion> "COWARDS DIE IN SHAME"
[12:36] <03trenchfoot> 6Muffled, 13from 6the 13back 6room: "COWARDS DIE IN SHAME"
[12:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "THANK you."
[12:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Wisdom!"
[12:38] <03VoxPVoxD> "So who won?"
[12:42] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The--*hic*--White Lady"
[12:43] <03dammitwho> "Have you ever had a drink so bad you decide to go home"
[12:43] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Not us"
[12:44] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi curls up in the chair. "Hey do you like spiders?"
[12:45] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya is suddenly extremely glad he didn't stop Eikichi from any of his purchases.
[12:45] <03Crion> 4Ir giggles. "Got one of them mad at me today"
[12:45] <03Crion> "Didn't respect the bounds"
[12:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You gotta respect the bounds."
[12:45] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is standing straight and walking carefully in the way that extremely drunk people who do not want to show that they are drunk do. "What. Spiders? What"
[12:47] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi belches. It tastes like caramel and bile. "No reason."
[12:47] <03Crion> "That's what the spider's sign said, yeah." 4Ir yawns and straightens a bit. "Th'nk they'd mind if I made us some drunk food?"
[12:47] <03Crion> "I'm gonna make us some drunk food."
[12:47] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "As long as it's not demonic drunk food, we're okay."
[12:48] <03trenchfoot> 13A voice comes through from the back: "Save some for me!" 6A followup, shortly after: "...Please."
[12:48] <03Crion> "Pfffffffff. Pork buns, Si-Sijan style."
[12:49] <03Crion> 4They even have the meat in the back. Ir quickly negotiates use of the kitchen with the money she was going to bribe that bureaucrat with.
[12:50] <03Crion> 4She's done five minutes later, with forty-four pork-and-lamb buns steamed to perfection, spiced perfectly with curry powder, coriander and cinnamon.
[12:50] <03Crion> 4It got pretty loud in there for a moment.
[12:51] <03Crion> 4But she marches out of the kitchen with a big, towel-covered basket in hand and leads the way back to their rooms, where they can enjoy them and talk in piece.
[12:51] <03Crion> 4And peace.
[12:51] <03VoxPVoxD> "How did you do that"
[12:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is sitting down next to a wall in their room, snoozing. It'd be pretty easy to wake her up, though.
[12:53] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Some folks c'n fight better drunk than they c'n sober. Me," 4she sets the basket on a table surrounded by divans and flops down on one. "I cook."
[12:53] <03Crion> 4She's already pilfered two of the buns. So good.
[12:54] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nudges Blossom, holding a pork bun out for her.
[12:55] <03dammitwho> "Mmm." 7She takes it. "So what did you guys do."
[12:56] <03dammitwho> "Jump in a hole?" 7She laughs.
[12:56] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We found out about some jobs. We hit some bars. I got you some presents. Three- two presents. Two presents."
[12:58] <03Crion|> 4Ir: "Jobs?"
[12:58] <03Crion|> 4Ir: "They gonna keep us here?"
[12:59] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, they're in Nexus mostly. Or around. We're in the River Province now. The Scavenger Lands! All kinds of stuff here."
[13:00] <03Crion|> 4Ir snaps her fingers and Iscariot jumps into her hand from around her waist, shivering into a six-string, which she idly and softly plays scales and short ditties on while they talk.
[13:00] <03Crion|> "No kiddin'."
[13:04] <03Crion|> "...You know what the deal with Thorns is?"
[13:05] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi lets out a strained half-laugh. "...yeah."
[13:06] <03Crion|> 4Ir closes her eyes and leans back on the divan. "So did the spider. Showed it to us."
[13:06] <03Crion|> "Couldn't make much sense though."
[13:06] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's rough."
[13:06] <03Crion|> "Ehhhhh. Feel like it's what he wants to be doin'."
[13:08] <03Crion|> "Oh" 4She sits up like she just remembered something, but it's just to grab another pork bun. "We got a dock."
[13:09] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Excellent. Where?"
[13:09] <03Crion|> 4She waves a pork-bunned hand. "Nexus. Ask Blossom. She knows all that crap."
[13:09] <03Crion|> "You know there's already docks there, for airships?"
[13:10] <03Crion|> "Yeah. Apparently someone's just been like--sun, these are good--squatting on one."
[13:10] <03Crion|> "Hopin' someone flies into town."
[13:10] <03Crion|> "It's probably old as shit and covered in dumb crap we'll have to move, but it's there."
[13:10] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks at Blossom. She didn't fall asleep with a bun in her mouth, did she? "I'm a little surprised they're still standing, but I guess it's easy enough to keep up if nobody uses it."
[13:15] <03dammitwho> "Hnng?" 7She did, in fact, fall asleep with a bun in her mouth. She takes it out, chews, swallows. "Yeah. We can... can arrange it on the way even."
[13:20] <03Crion> "Man." 4Ir balances her current pork bun on her breastbone as she flops back down. "This is all pretty cool. We're all pretty cool. You all are pretty cool."
[13:20] <03Crion> "S'the part where the assassins jump in the windows."
[13:21] <03Crion> "...Nope?"
[13:21] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi snorts. "Tatsuya's busy."
[13:21] <03Crion> "That's pretty cool too."
[13:21] <03VoxPVoxD> "Sometimes things are cool."
[13:22] <03Crion> "Fucked up, but true"
[13:22] <03Crion> 4She finishes the pork bun. "Gonna get less cool when we reach Nexus."
[13:22] <03Crion> "Enjoy it while we can."
[13:23] <03dammitwho> "Nah. Eikichi knows everything about Nexus."
[13:24] <03dammitwho> 7She waves an arm. "Eyy I'm walkin' 'ere. Eyy I'm walkin' 'ere. Eyy I'm walkin' 'ere"
[13:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi dissolves into giggles.
[13:24] <03Crion> 4Ir breaks out in a fit of giggles, almost choking on her pork bun.
[13:25] <03dammitwho> 7She snort-giggles. "I'm gonna do that the whole time. Wow Eikichi, a meat seller where you have to go inside! Only in Nexus!"
[13:26] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "When you do that every pickpocket in the city is going to descend on you. And it still won't be a fair fight."
[13:26] <03Crion> "I'm gonna, gonna learn the traditional food of Nexus, and cook it every night. I'm gonna call it: gabagool"
[13:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's like the sound a baby makes when they throw up."
[13:28] <03Crion> "Sounds like Octavian's dipshit brother. Gabagool, Demon of the Blurst Circle."
[13:28] <03Crion> "Gabagool. gabagool gabagool gaga--gabagool."
[13:29] <03Crion> 4She's quiet for a moment. Then: "Think my horse is getting smarter."
[13:29] <03dammitwho> "Oh boy thats-a spicy meat ball-a"
[13:30] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Smarter how?"
[13:31] <03Crion> "He's already been pretty smart, but I blessed him--touched him with the Sun--and now he's like, sighing at me and shit. You know he walked us home from the bar tonight? Yeah."
[13:32] <03Crion> "Yep." 4She closes her eyes. "I blessed my horse, and now he's smarter than me."
[13:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Wow."

[13:36] <03dammitwho> "No YOU are!"
[13:37] <03Crion> 4Ir, solemnly: "The dreaded Anthema trade curses, each more powerful than ten thousand killing words,"
[13:38] <03Crion> "Anthema. Antheema. Anathema."

[13:41] <03Crion> "Thaaat'll happen."
[13:44] <03Crion> 4She's quiet for a longer bit now. Then, still leaned way back and staring up at the ceiling: "I'm glad I met you people out there on the ice."
[13:45] <03dammitwho> "Yeah. Yeah."
[13:46] <03Crion> "I'm glad I didn't do what I originally went out there to do."

[13:47] <03Crion> "Just knocked me out, chained me to a wall and preached at me twelve hours a day."
[13:47] <03Crion> "So in retrospect that was just a shitty plan all around."

[13:50] <03Crion> "Yyyyyyyyep." 4She lurches to her feet. "I'm gonna head to bed. Let you two, uh. Exchange gifts. Hopefully remember this conversation in the morning."
[13:51] <03Crion> "Because I find myself happy to be having it." 4Just before she closes the door: "Rest of the pork buns are yours."

[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>   
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:24] <03Crion>  
[10:26] <03Crion> "So how do we get water in this thing?" 4asks Ir, Twice Traitor, wearing a shift and some very abbreviated cotton undershorts, frowning at Blossom's big brass bathtub.
[10:29] <03Crion> 4The Heavensward's essence reactor is in the next room -- actually it's kind of poking into this one a little bit -- but she's used to its thrum by now. Her room's right over it, after all.
[10:30] <03Crion> 4Iscariot is curled around her head like a tiara, holding up her hair; she spends a lot of time braiding it, and that's much harder to do when wet.
[10:31] <03dammitwho> "You fill the cylindrical tank on the other side of this wall here-" 7She pats the bulkhead between the washroom and the essence core. "And let the natural flow keep the water at a pleasant temperature. Then you turn this little valve here-" 7She points at a small copper pipe poking out of the wall. "-to fill the tub itself."
[10:32] <03Crion> 4She frowns. "Do I need to fly us down to the river? Does it have, like, a straw?"
[10:33] <03dammitwho> 7The tub is a utilitarian affair, such that Ir can still see the hammer marks from where it was worked out of raw copper. "Finally, when you're done, you pull out the stopper in the bottom and let the water drain out to the bilges."
[10:33] <03dammitwho> "Oh, I just filled the tank with buckets, like every other bath."
[10:33] <03Crion> 4Ir thought it was weird this thing even had bilges, being that it was an airship. Everything comes in handy eventually.
[10:34] <03Crion> "Oh. Nice."
[10:35] <03Crion> "So..." 4She walks over and hesitantly turns the valve. "Let's see how this--"
[10:35] <03dammitwho> 7Sploosh! Water begins to pour out, steaming a little.
[10:36] <03Crion> 4The water sputters and shoots out from the pressure, making Ir flinch back slightly, but it settles into a smooth pour.
[10:36] <03Crion> "Cool."
[10:36] <03Crion> "Well."
[10:36] <03Crion> "Hot."
[10:36] <03Crion> 4How big is the tub? Can it seat four comfortably?
[10:37] <03Crion> 4Ir's used to the communal hot baths of Pneuma. That far North it's just inefficient to heat a tub for one person, after all.
[10:38] <03dammitwho> 7It can probably manage two. You know, if they like each other.
[10:39] <03Crion> 4Fair enough. They are pressed for space.
[10:40] <03dammitwho> "You seem... disappointed?"
[10:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Oh! Oh, no. I was just thinking of home."
[10:41] <03Crion> "We don't have individual baths in Pneuma. Well, some of the richers do, but not most of us."
[10:42] <03Crion> "It's wasteful to heat a bath just for one, right?" 4She looks around for a towel. "So instead of having tubs at home, we'd have bathhouses."
[10:42] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom thinks for a moment. "Oh, right. Heat at a premium."
[10:43] <03dammitwho> "Well, apart from that, what do you think?"
[10:44] <03Crion> 4Ir turns her back to Blossom, and in one smooth motion she pulls her top up and off while Iscariot whips out, snatches a towel from the rack she'd screwed into the wall a couple hours earlier, and cinches it around her torso.
[10:44] <03Crion> "I think it's marvelous."
[10:44] <03Crion> "No one's ever put a hot bath on a ship. At least not that I've ever heard of."
[10:46] <03Crion> 4The room is starting to fog up. "Maybe we shound add some benches in here or something. You can get a steam bath in here without even getting in the water.
[10:46] <03Crion> "
[10:47] <03dammitwho> 7She shrugs. "The only reason is having to fit 150 men in a space this size. If we didn't have the core I could build a small boiler or something..."
[10:47] <03dammitwho> "Oh, that's a good thought. Maybe a hotter tank and some stones for a sauna."
[10:48] <03Crion> 4She shimmies out of the undershorts underneath the towel, then slips into the tub with her back towards Blossom. As she sinks in, Iscariot whips the towel up and swaddles it around her hair.
[10:48] <03Crion> "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh."
[10:48] <03Crion> "Damn."
[10:48] <03Crion> "You've outdone yourself, princess."
[10:50] <03dammitwho> "There's some soapwort in that little box built out of the floor to your left."
[10:51] <03Crion> "Thanks." 4Ir reaches over the edge of the tub and taps the box open, then removes the waxy substance.
[10:51] <03Crion> "You been in here with Eikichi yet?"
[10:51] <03Crion> 4She leans her head back so she can see Blossom and grins. "Seems like it could seat two."
[10:53] <03dammitwho> 7She flushes slightly. "He hasn't even seen it yet!"
[10:54] <03Crion> "You should fix that."
[10:56] <03Crion> "C'mon, princess." 4Ir leans forward again to use the soapwort. "I'll chaperone."
[10:58] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Footsteps approach! "Blossom? Blossom, did you see where all the soapwort went?"
[10:59] <03Crion> 4Ir: "IN HERE!"
[10:59] <03dammitwho> "IT'S-- uh"
[10:59] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi follows the voice to- "Ah."
[10:59] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yo."
[11:00] <03Crion> "We have a bath now."
[11:00] <03dammitwho> "Finished it on the way over!"
[11:01] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Well don't just stand there, pretty boy. Shut the door."
[11:01] <03Crion> "You're letting out all the steam."
[11:02] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi hesitates just a moment before shutting the door. "How's it work?"
[11:03] <03Crion> "Pretty damn well."
[11:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10He seeks out Blossom in the steam. "When did you finish it?"
[11:05] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Before we landed. I've had that copper sitting around since we first made it to the Hedgehog."
[11:06] <03dammitwho> "Ir's suggested we add a hotter tank for a sauna..."
[11:06] <03Crion> "Feels good, doesn't it?"
[11:06] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, that's a good idea."
[11:07] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Plus, gonna be honest, we were kinda starting to smell like shit."
[11:07] <03Crion> "Even through the perfumes."
[11:08] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I never should've given Blossom that collar."

[08:28] <03Ferrinus> 12Everything's arranged. Blossom's put a long-range requisition for a defunct airship dock together, Eikichi and Tatsuya have checked in with the Velvet Room and appraised themselves of a big bundle of potential sidequests, and Ir got extremely drunk.
[08:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10She made pork buns!
[08:29] <03Ferrinus> 12It remains now to simply decide how much longer you'll stay in Sijan before moving on. They haven't given you any kind of time limit, although it'll probably become awkward if you laze around for more than a week.
[08:29] <03Ferrinus> 12Also, sometime between the first morning and first afternoon since you stay in the city, a robed official arrives to let you know that the Funeral Order has a request for you.
[08:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's pretty much ready to go when he wakes up that next morning.
[08:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Okay, okay, he's pretty much ready to go when he wakes up that next afternoon.
[08:30] <03Crion> 4Ir's ready to roll that night, but yeah, probably wiser to wait until she's sobered up, then killed the hangover.
[08:30] <03dammitwho> 7What? What does the Funeral Order want?
[08:31] <03Crion> 4Ugghhhhhh.
[08:31] <03Ferrinus> 12Official: "It seems... well, it seems that some unknown force has been stealing bodies."
[08:31] <03Crion> 4Well, Ir's gonna pack and get Errant ready to head out while Blossom deals with the bureaucrat.
[08:31] <03Crion> 4You gotta be--
[08:32] <03Ferrinus> 12Official: "Sometimes crypts are smashed and traps demolished... other times no means of entry or egress can be detected. We don't know if it's a man or a demon."
[08:32] <03Crion> 4This isn't our problem...
[08:32] <03Ferrinus> 12Official: "We would be in your debt if you could determine what was going on, or put a stop to it..."
[08:32] <03Crion> 4...but something tells Ir it's about to be.
[08:32] <03Ferrinus> 12It actually isn't, but they've got to try.
[08:33] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm."
[08:33] <03Crion> 4Frankly, it's up to Tatsuya.
[08:33] <03Crion> 4He's the guy who could run this down.
[08:33] <03dammitwho> 7She prods Eikichi with a finger. "How quickly do you think your sorcerer's sight could narrow that down?"
[08:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying looks almost as rough as she feels. There's an extremely wobbly "SORRY - T" in a notebook that was in her lap when she came to, and a weird-looking drink that probably used to be an egg nearby, but these are not enough to make over for the head-splitting hangover Tatsuya left her to deal with.
[08:34] <03Crion> 4...Or Eikichi.
[08:34] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi squints at Blossom: "I'd have to catch them in the act. That means staying at least another night."
[08:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10That is Blossom, right? Her face is so swimmy...
[08:36] <03Crion> 4Ir's down for helping the random commonfolk out as asked, even if that means staying a bit longer, but obviously it's the call of the people actually able to resolve this issue.
[08:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, for her part, has just come back from a brisk run through the streets around their lodgings.
[08:36] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Oh fuck off.
[08:36] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying just moans piteously. "Whyyyyy..."
[08:37] <03Crion> 4Now that's some dedication.
[08:37] <03dammitwho> 7That's how you cure a hangover! Austere self-improvement!
[08:37] <03Crion> 4Ir, meanwhile, has commandeered the kitchen to make Hangover Eggs.
[08:37] <03Crion> 4They're just normal eggs.
[08:37] <03dammitwho> "That's up to you. And Tatsuya, I suppose."
[08:38] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's words come out slowly. "We can do it if you want. I do want to stress, though, that every extra day you ask us to stay, and every favor you ask us, greatly multiplies the risk that the low profile you wanted us to keep will, uh, rise."
[08:38] <03Crion> 4She offers the managers the option of cooking for the whole building. Do they accept?
[08:39] <03Ferrinus> 12It takes them a moment to determine that this isn't some kind of deliberate social trap, but no one in the River Province is going to turn down free real estate. Ir has the floor, if she needs it.
[08:42] <03Crion> 4Ir steps into the kitchen and runs it like a boss. The eggs come out every five minutes like clockwork, distributed evenly amongst the guests and then the staff.
[08:43] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "Tatsuya's busy, being a big dumb idiot, who just-- grrrr!" 13She huffs, smooths out her skirt, and calms slightly. "What for, even. Like, even aside from us being in a hurry."
[08:44] <03Ferrinus> 12The funerary official winces slightly, but doesn't look as though they've been made to reconsider. "Well... yes, we know. It does help that the great graveyard itself is up on the surface, out of sight of Sijan's actual denizens."
[08:44] <03Crion> 4Once the cooking is done, Ir emerges from the back with a two-foot-long peppermill in hand, and walks around the common room peppering the eggs to taste.
[08:44] <03Crion> 4To Eikichi: "I can prep the Heavensward to go either way. We could give it a night, and if there's nothing, we could move on."
[08:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Uggggggghhhhhhh. Fine. Fine. Whatever. I'm going back to bed."
[08:45] <03Crion> 4She salutes him lazily with the peppermill and finishes her garnishes.
[08:46] <03Crion> 4Then it's off to the Heavensward with Errant to make good on what she said.
[08:47] <03Ferrinus> 12Official: "The Order will be extremely grateful if you can clear this matter up, of course. Your cadre will be able to count on financial and diplomatic support, insofar as it is practical."
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Works for Ir.
[08:47] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Practical," 13she echoes.
[08:48] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We'll need to bring our airship atop the mound to do this, at least at some point. Is that okay?"
[08:48] <03Ferrinus> 12Official: "An air- ...you won't be landing it ON anything, will you? Some of the statuary is quite delicate."
[08:49] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'll put it up in the cloud cover so as not to scare off our quarry."
[08:49] <03Crion> "Just a question of airspace rights."
[08:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi staggers back up to his bed, and at the foot of it sees the three bags, two that contain gifts and one that, uh, used to. Oh well, they can roll exterminator fees into whatever financial support they're offering. The two still-intact bags that aren't covered in slime end up on Blossom's bed before Eikichi crashes for another couple of hours.
[08:50] <03dammitwho> 7Eh? What're these?
[08:51] <03Ferrinus> 12Unless any of you challenge multiple city blocks to a duel or something, the day should pass without incident. Let me know if or when you move for the necropolis.
[08:53] <03Crion> 4Ir heads out with Errant, returns to the Heavensward, stables her mount, says hi to Ami, chats with Sondok for a half-hour or so, then takes the helm and brings the airship around.
[08:55] <03Ferrinus> 12This is a tricky problem... but, thankfully, the necropolis is a proper necropolis, one in which no expense was spared. You can't hide a ship in a normal graveyard, but you could probably slide the Heavensward veerrrrry carefully between that towering ziggurat on one side and that forest of dread obelisks on the other.
[08:55] <03Ferrinus> 12Between the shadows, obstructions, and inexplicable eerie mist, you'd be nice and hidden.
[08:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10The smaller bag holds a pendant, white and yellow gold covered in age-smudged ideograms. A symbol of the sun recovered from some old ruin, with hundreds of marks on them. Blossom'll recognize that this is some dialect of Old Realm or other, but the meaning of the marks might take some effort to puzzle out.
[08:56] <03Crion> 4Ir's very careful, especially when it comes to other people's ships.
[08:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10The larger bag holds a fine wooden box, which contains three pieces of shaped Western tree rubber resting on felt. Two of them are cylindrical - Blossom finds that they fit nicely in the palms of her hands. The third is shaped like a crescent.
[08:58] <03dammitwho> 7How sweet! Oh no, Blossom needs to start making gifts for the others...
[08:59] <03dammitwho> 7Is Eikichi awake yet?
[08:59] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sound asleep.
[08:59] <03dammitwho> "Uh- Ying?"
[09:00] <03trenchfoot> 13She's lying on the floor, but is still awake. "Wuzzat?"
[09:01] <03dammitwho> "Do you know why Eikichi gave me these tiny sacks of dead beetles, labeled 'Just in case'?"
[09:03] <03trenchfoot> 13She moves to sit up and look at Blossom. "He gave you -- what? Why would he- I guess that's why you're asking me, huh."
[09:04] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "They were tucked into the bags that had the other gifts..."
[09:04] <03trenchfoot> "No idea. I don't think Tatsuya knows either, but it's kinda hard remembering last night..."
[09:04] <03dammitwho> 7She shakes one of the bags dubiously. "Are they... special beetles?"
[09:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "They must be, right? It'd be weirder if they were just, normal beetles."
[09:05] <03trenchfoot> "Dead normal beetles. In a bag."
[09:09] <03dammitwho> "Right."
[09:11] <03Crion> 4Ir spends some time among the tombstones, playing sad music.
[09:13] <03Crion> "Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire..."
[09:14] <03Ferrinus> 12Will the rest of the circle simply hike their way up and meet Ir at the Heavensward?
[09:15] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi probably won't wake up naturally on his own until after dark, but other than that, yeah!
[09:15] <03Crion> 4Well, they won't meet her by the Heavensward. That's the whole point of hiding the damn thing.
[09:16] <03Crion> 4She's not particularly hard to find, though.
[09:16] <03dammitwho> 7Yeah, Blossom can ask Eikichi what the deal is when they're done with work.
[09:17] <03Crion> "When you're sad and lonely / And you haven't got a friend / Just remember, that death is not the end..."
[09:17] <03Ferrinus> 12So will you first meet together prior to or post-sunset, and what'll you do? You've been told the locations of all the known recent break-ins/corpse thefts, if that helps.
[09:17] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Any pattern?
[09:19] <03Crion> 4Hopefully Blossom wakes Eikichi up a bit early so they can meet before sunset. They probably want to scope all this out before they lose the Sun.
[09:19] <03Ferrinus> 12Good question. You pore over the notes...
[09:27] <03Ferrinus> 12...yes, there's a definite pattern here, Eikichi can elucidate.
[09:28] <03VoxPVoxD> "The grave robbery sites are just a mishmash that doesn't mean anything... from this angle." 10Eikichi rotates the map 90 degrees. "Can anyone see what our thieves are drawing now?"
[09:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10No? "These correspond to the stars that make up the constellation 'The Mask', tied to Jupiter. Intrigue, deception, trickery..."
[09:29] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't bother glancing over. He's flirting with Blossom anyway.
[09:29] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm."
[09:30] <03Crion> "Don't say goodbye to me / Describe the sky to me / And if the sky falls, mark my words / We'll catch mockingbirds."
[09:30] <03VoxPVoxD> "My guess is, the next site they'll hit will be here." 10He points at the spot where the Mask's second eye will be.
[09:31] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Whose tomb is that, anyway?
[09:32] <03dammitwho> "A moment." 7She steps aside and begins concentrating on the Essence-forms that make up the Infallible Messenger.
[09:32] <03Ferrinus> 12It's very old. If you ask the Funeral Order, they'll send a runner off to the house of records and return to you with the information that a Lookshy general who died two hundred years ago was buried there at great expense.
[09:33] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Was she buried with anything that will explode when the tomb is breached?"
[09:36] <03Ferrinus> 12Mortician: "We-e-e-llll...." 12In truth there are most certainly sorcerous and geomantic traps laced through the structure, ones which should still be holding. Of course, traps haven't stopped any of the other attacks.
[09:36] <03Ferrinus> 12They're loathe to give you any of the details, unfortunately.
[09:36] <03Crion> 4That's fine. We're not going inside.
[09:36] <03Crion> 4...We're not going inside, right?
[09:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You're going to make us protect a tomb and not tell us what's inside? I hope you don't expect us to actually enter it, then."
[09:37] <03dammitwho> 7That depends on whether Blossom gets a response.
[09:38] <03Ferrinus> 12Blossom doesn't receive a response for several hours, but she does get one. A six-winged cherub carved from chrome comes flitting in through a window to whisper into her ear in Yara's voice: "Not that I know, and I can't imagine why they would. I'll check, though."
[09:40] <03Ferrinus> 12No further word, though. Who knows how long it could take to check, or if there's anything to find?
[09:40] <03Crion> 4We agreed to give them one night. Let's just stake the damn tomb out and see what happens.
[09:40] <03dammitwho> 7To the others: "Probably not the Star-Chosen. That's good."
[09:42] <03Ferrinus> 12If Ir leans on the Sijanese before heading off to grab the Heavensward, she can make sure that the Squared Circle is furnished with a jade slip that should unlock the tomb in question, command words that will disable some of the traps, and knowledge of where to step so as to not trigger others.
[09:42] <03Crion> 4The next time the mortician comes by, Ir corners him alone over near some mausoleum from a few hundred years before. It's hard to hear what she's saying, but her body language is very...forceful.
[09:42] <03Crion> 4Never say she never did nothing for ya.
[09:43] <03Ferrinus> 12Anything else before you actually go up there? And once you do, what's the plan, a stakeout?
[09:43] <03Crion> 4She's sure as shit not going in there, though. That's on Tatsuya and Eikichi. That's their whole thing, isn't it?
[09:44] <03VoxPVoxD> 10If Ying doesn't want to disturb Tatsuya, Eikichi'll bring Sondok at least.
[09:45] <03Crion> 4Hell yeah.
[09:45] <03dammitwho> 7Agreed, a stakeout.
[09:46] <03Crion> 4Once Blossom, Eikichi, and Sondok meet up with Ir, she snaps Iscariot from a six-string into a spear. If she's doing this without the Sun's plate, she'll do it with her most familiar arm.
[09:55] <03Ferrinus> 12The great necropolis of sijan isn't exactly a wilderness, but a lot of the principles of hunting in, say, craggy mountains can easily be made to apply here when it comes to finding sight lines, covering positions, and quietly settling in for the long wit. Blossom's able to find the Circle a somewhat uncomfortable but completely circumspect perch atop the tomb of some rich merchant, 
[09:55] <03Ferrinus> 12one that blocks sight of she and her fellows with statues of of the province's river gods.
[09:56] <03Crion> 4Ir pushes up against one of the statue's sides, holding Iscariot behind her and between herself and the statue. Just so no light glints off the moonsilver.
[09:56] <03Ferrinus> 12Attuning herself to the spirits, Blossom's increasingly certain that she's come to the right place - or, at least, that Eikichi's found some separate weird thing to investigate. There are lots of ghosts up here in the necropolis, shuffling through the streets and alleyways, sitting or praying at their own or others' tombs, examining or exchanging trade goods. Some of them see you 
[09:56] <03Ferrinus> 12and follow you for a time; others are so vibrant that even the other members of the Circle catch glimpses.
[09:57] <03Ferrinus> 12But tonight, many of the unquiet dead look antsy, shifty, paranoid. They keep eyeing the sky fearfully or staying close to walls and tight alleyways. Around the tomb of the old general that you're staking out right now, almost none are in evidence - they're either all avoiding it, or those that would normally be present have been sealed or banished or something.
[09:58] <03Ferrinus> 12Eikichi and Ir, meanwhile, spot something of note in the world of the living: one of the living.
[09:58] <03Crion> 4Well shit.
[09:58] <03Ferrinus> 12You see, there hasn't been so much as a rat up here for all the hours you've been prowling around or sitting still and watching.
[09:59] <03Ferrinus> 12But, its shell glinting in the moonlight, a large bug of some kind - a beetle, maybe - has come crawling across the paviliion and up the door of the tomb. As you watch, it wriggles and pushes and struggles until it's squeezed itself through the crack between door and wall to disappear into the structure.
[09:59] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Oh Gods. It's not one of-
[10:00] <03Crion> 4The fuck is that?
[10:00] <03Ferrinus> 12You don't know - you're not an entomologist and anyway it was quite far away.
[10:01] <03Crion> 4Ir looks over at Eikichi. Are we just gonna wait for it to come out from here, or...?
[10:01] <03Ferrinus> 12You really had to strain your eyes to make it out at all, really. You just know that something small and rounded and shiny just squeezed its way into the tomb, and that it moved in the kind of scrambly way you associate with insects.
[10:01] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nudges Blossom. Did she see that?
[10:03] <03dammitwho> "What?"
[10:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A bug just squeezed into the tomb."
[10:04] <03Crion> "...I can guess how it's gonna get the body out."
[10:05] <03Crion> 4Ir pantomimes a goofy zombie walk.
[10:05] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "As long as it doesn't eat whatever's left of the corpse."
[10:05] <03VoxPVoxD> "That'd be gross."
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...If it hijacks the corpse, are we allowed to like, hurt it?"
[10:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "No sense in pursuit. It has only one way out."
[10:07] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It wasn't supposed to have any way in."
[10:09] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Are we going in after it, or...?"
[10:10] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "They asked us to save the tomb, right? Not just catch the tomb raider."
[10:10] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Eikichi makes a good point. Ir, you and Sondok should stay at the entrance and keep it from escaping. Eikichi and I will go in and investigate."
[10:11] <03Crion> 4Ir steps away from the statue and stretches. "Works for me."
[10:11] <03Ferrinus> 12We-elll, you're supposed to just put a stop to this. Technically if this was the last body stolen, rather than the first saved, you'd still have done your job.
[10:11] <03Ferrinus> 12And it's not like they're your bosses.
[10:12] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Yeah but Eikichi's butt hurts sitting on this statue.
[10:14] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "What about me?" 13She's been pretty quiet - first thing she's said all night, actually.
[10:14] <03Crion> 4To Ying: "You're with Blossom and Eikichi."
[10:14] <03Ferrinus> 12Yes, Ying is there, too.
[10:15] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Works for me."
[10:15] <03Crion> 4Ir goes over everything she learned from the mortician with Blossom, Eikichi, and Ying a second time. Just to be sure.
[10:15] <03Crion> 4She hands over the jade talent for the door, too.
[10:16] <03Ferrinus> 12Anyway, if you want to gain entrance, you're to press your slip of white jade against the exact center of the door with the palm of your right hand, and then splay your left palm across the tips of your right hand's fingers.
[10:16] <03VoxPVoxD> 10By instinct, Eikichi lets Blossom handle the jade.
[10:17] <03Crion> 4Ir hangs back from the others as they approach the tomb, finds a tall headstone to put her back against, and slides down to wait.
[10:18] <03Crion> 4She's no more than forty paces from the tomb's entrance, and anyone who walks out will see her waiting for them.
[10:19] <03dammitwho> 7Alright, Blossom presses the slip against the door as instructed.
[10:20] <03Ferrinus> 12Nothing happens for a full minute, but that's how it's supposed to go - the activation's low-key, meant to deter and discourage. There's a faint vibration under Blossom's hands then, and finally the portal slowly grinds open - it doesn't swing in or out, but sinks into the floor.
[10:20] <03Ferrinus> 12You're given to notice, as it moves, that it's totally flush with its frame... except for a little spot on the right side that's been a teensy bit eroded or chipped or something. Guess that's how the bug got in.
[10:21] <03VoxPVoxD> 10How recent is that?
[10:21] <03Ferrinus> 12Good question-
[10:21] <03Crion> 4To Sondok: "Anything special about tomb robbers?"
[10:21] <03Crion> "Or are they just like any other thieves."
[10:23] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok, who bled into the world after the kids vanished, scowls. "It's ugly."
[10:23] <03Crion> "No one dies forever in Hell. That's what they say, at least."
[10:23] <03dammitwho> 7Extremely untrue.
[10:24] <03Ferrinus> 12Anyway, the tomb extends before you. There's all kinds of jade inlay in the walls, and you can only see that by virtue of the moonlight behind you and any torches or caste marks you've chosen to light your path with because it's otherwise pitch black. It is, you're well aware, a hellish maze in which one wrong step will get you incinerated, electrocuted, or bisected by gigantic hidden 
[10:24] <03Ferrinus> 12blades.
[10:24] <03Ferrinus> 12Fortunately, you know all the right turns to make and the Old Realm phrases to intone. If you want to make your way straight for the sarcophagus itself, you need merely do so.
[10:26] <03Crion> 4Ir's quiet for awhile. Then: "These people. Sijan. Do they know what the fuck they're on about?"
[10:26] <03VoxPVoxD> 10What phase is the moon in, anyway? Might be astrologically relevant.
[10:26] <03Crion> "Can they make the dead truly pass on?"
[10:27] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "So..." 13She's whispering, which doesn't really help when it's the only noise other than their footsteps. "Spooky place, huh."
[10:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "They can make the dead behave. For anyone living, that's good enough."
[10:27] <03Ferrinus> 12Waning crescent.
[10:28] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Is it?"
[10:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Yes."
[10:28] <03VoxPVoxD> "Sijan does it through bribery. An exorcist might do it by force."
[10:29] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm only here because of the dead."
[10:30] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi keeps going deeper. "It's fine."
[10:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "As you say."
[10:32] <03Ferrinus> 12So as you head in, how do you light your way, do you keep weapons at the ready, and otherwise what is your demeanor?
[10:32] <03Crion> 4Ir: "As I say."
[10:33] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom has her caste mark lit and is ready for anything.
[10:33] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi has no visible armament. He does have a torch or something, though - lot of experience being the one responsible for supplies in an expedition.
[10:34] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I guess. What if it isn't though." 13She's looking a little more animated than she was outside the tomb, but mostly just looks uncomfortable and flinches occasionally at whatever noises they can here. She's unarmed, but prepared.
[10:34] <03Crion> "My horse is behind me a half-league and up another. Other than him, everyone I care about in this world is in that tomb." 4She gestures with Iscariot. "I killed all the others."
[10:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "These ones are still alive."
[10:35] <03Ferrinus> 12Something's awry. The tomb-diving party hasn't been hit by a trap or made a wrong turn yet... but they're pretty sure that when they intone the command words that'll turn off this fire trap or that lightning barrier or whatnot, they should be able to hear and feel the destructive essence subside. You know, a sort of descending vvwheeeooooo.... note.
[10:35] <03Ferrinus> 12Is it already off?
[10:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "One smart bug?"
[10:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "They're going to stay that way."
[10:36] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Or they'll need to find us tombs as well."
[10:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No."
[10:36] <03Crion> "They're going to stay that way."
[10:36] <03Ferrinus> 12Last question: how quiet are you being as you approach?
[10:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Or not a bug at all."
[10:37] <03Ferrinus> 12Approach the sarcophagus itself, I mean. It's just a few turns away.
[10:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Well, we're talking.
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 13Talking quietly! But, yes.
[10:37] <03dammitwho> 7Oh. In that case, Blossom will at least be walking quietly. Possibly whoever is there could have heard them talking anyway?
[10:39] <03Ferrinus> 12Blossom, Eikichi, and Tatsuya turn a corner to find... a figure in a robe. He or she is wearing the silver manacles of the Funeral Order and is holding a glowing, purple crystal up in the course of examining an elaborate, jade-trimmed sarcophagus.
[10:40] <03Crion> 4To Sondok: "Do you know my full name?"
[10:40] <03Ferrinus> 12Fierce, snarling faces representing lions and tigers decorate the walls of the room, weapons, suits of armor, and various glittering treasures hang or sit arrayed around the chamber, and so forth.
[10:41] <03Ferrinus> 12A male voice you don't recognize: "What are you doing here?"
[10:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok shakes her head. "Should I?"
[10:41] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No."
[10:41] <03Crion> "I've never said it before."
[10:41] <03Crion> "I've only heard it once."
[10:41] <03Crion> "'Ir, Twice Traitor."
[10:41] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You know who gave me that name?"
[10:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok shakes her head again.
[10:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We should be asking you that question."
[10:42] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The Sun Himself."
[10:43] <03Ferrinus> 12Will Ying remain in the shadows or reveal herself?
[10:43] <03Ferrinus> 12Oh, or Blossom?
[10:43] <03Ferrinus> 12Either of them was quiet and light enough on their feet that they could've caught on and stayed out of sight while Eikichi strode on in.
[10:43] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom will reveal herself! Looking stern as heck and standing side-by-side with Eikichi.
[10:44] <03Crion> 4She closes her eyes. "First thing He said to me, and last. Likely the only."
[10:44] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying will stay hidden and see if she can't get an angle on this guy. Besides, Blossom's visible now for the "we," he'll never be expecting a second hidden person.
[10:45] <03Ferrinus> 12Well, then, the robed figure visibly blanches. "...Solar?!"
[10:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Harsh."
[10:45] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Well-earned."
[10:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yes. What manner of creature are you?"
[10:46] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...But yes. Harsh."
[10:48] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "Have you forgiven him?"
[10:48] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The Sun?"
[10:49] <03Ferrinus> 12He draws back a bit, then paces around the sarcophagus, still keeping it between himself and you. He doesn't lower his hood or anything, though, and takes a while to respond. "...I'm loathe to say. Little reason to trust you as yet."
[10:49] <03Ferrinus> 12Robed man: "You are... robbers? Looters?"
[10:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh, fuck off."
[10:49] <03trenchfoot> 13Come on.
[10:50] <03Crion> "I never blamed Him."
[10:50] <03VoxPVoxD> "We came in here to follow you and you know it. What, are you going to chew a hole in empiricism now?"
[10:51] <03trenchfoot> 13That would be a hell of a trick. Hmm. 6Something to practice later.
[10:51] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "What obeisance can you possibly owe this corpse-city that you'd follow me here on its orders?"
[10:51] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Real question is, have I forgiven myself."
[10:52] <03Crion> 4She's quiet for a moment. "Answer's no."
[10:52] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Unless... you are here at Heaven's request?"
[10:52] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi shrugs. "We were just passing by and they asked us for help. The real question is, why are you trying to lure Heaven here?"
[10:54] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Lure - no, no. I didn't plant these bodies. I'm removing them."
[10:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok's silent for a while, and then: "...how did that go, earlier? 'There's going to maybe be a few things you'll find very hard to forgive'."
[10:55] <03VoxPVoxD> "One of the songs you sang to the dead."
[10:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We can see that. Why do it in the shape of the Mask?"
[10:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That's what made you interesting."
[10:57] <03Crion> 4Ir laughs and shakes her head. Iscariot snaps into a six-string in her hand. "There'll always be a few things, maybe several things / That you're going to find really difficult to forgive."
[10:57] <03Crion> 4It snaps back into a spear.
[10:58] <03Crion> "I stand by that song."
[10:59] <03Crion> "Especially the part about killing all the judges."
[11:00] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Sondok: "I don't blame you."
[11:00] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "The shape isn't mine! Listen."
[11:01] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You should. I killed my best friend for no better reason than orthodoxy."
[11:01] <03Crion> "My punishment was to take up her spear."
[11:01] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "The chosen of the- the agents of- ahhh, useless. The heavens, they are working their will on... most things. The world entire. But in discrete ways, you see?"
[11:02] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "There is some plot of theirs here - an attempt to worm their way down, down, down into the netherworld. I don't know the specifics."
[11:03] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "You're talking about the Chosen of the Stars."
[11:03] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "But certain graves, certain bodies... they must be dealt with."
[11:04] <03Ferrinus> 12He starts. "You know of them! Then I can speak more plainly. Yes, the chosen of the stars, the chosen of the maidens, the" 12An hour later, you realize that you just don't remember the next phrase he used. ", those schemers, those-" 12What else did he say? It was pretty shocking... "They must be stopped!"
[11:05] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah, obviously, but what are you doing?"
[11:06] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "I'll devour the living, and the dead. Mostly the dead. Certain graves... I'm nearly done."
[11:06] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying's hanging out on the ceiling now. Clinging on up there, ready to drop down at the first sign of combat. Also, gross.
[11:06] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "See, I knew he was eating them!"
[11:07] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom wrinkles her nose in disgust.
[11:08] <03Crion> 4Ir will give the area a good once over while they wait. Just to make sure nothing's creeping up on them.
[11:08] <03dammitwho> "But once you've finished with this tomb, you'll be done?"
[11:09] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Almost. There's one more. But it will stop the-" 12Some kind of epithet, you think it was, later. "-building their bridge to below. Slow them, at least, I'm told."
[11:09] <03dammitwho> 7She tilts her head. "Told by whom?"
[11:10] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "An augur. Not one of theirs, obviously."
[11:11] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "But you trust them enough to crawl into tombs to eat corpses?"
[11:12] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Obviously. Now... do we have a problem?"
[11:12] <03trenchfoot> 13He's eating dead bodies. That's hell of gross.
[11:12] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi rubs the back of his neck. "See, we agreed to stop you. This is awkward."
[11:13] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "But he will actually stop after the next body."
[11:13] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What are we telling the Sijanese, then?"
[11:14] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Don't cross me, solar! It'd be folly to defend those who-" 12Later, you remember it being pretty bad, whatever they did. He had a point.
[11:16] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, patiently: "Yes, we're past that. The question is what we tell the Sijanese, to avoid being rude."
[11:17] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "I will be finished... the following night. Just use your golden tongue."
[11:17] <03trenchfoot> 13From the ceiling: "So we're not fighting, then?"
[11:18] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks briefly angry before he parses the statement fully. "Easy for you to say."
[11:18] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "...!!" 12He hisses - buzzes? - and kind of darts backward to put his back against the wall, feet spread and arms out in the beginnings of a combat stance.
[11:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "It would seem not. Could you tell the others?"
[11:19] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Others? You number... three or four at least? An entire Circle?"
[11:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying's hanging upside down and waving. "Hey! Insurance, sorry." 13She somersaults down to the ground and steps back behind Blossom and Eikichi.
[11:19] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You haven't heard of us?"
[11:19] <03VoxPVoxD> "Oh, I simply must send you back to your friends with a copy of our book."
[11:20] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "I have not. Who are you? You can call me Azer'jol."
[11:22] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I am Eikichi Sho. This is Excessively Righteous Blossom and Sunlit-Dreaming Ying. Outside and elsewhere are Ir and Tatsuya the Golden Hand."
[11:22] <03VoxPVoxD> "We're the Squared Circle."
[11:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hello."
[11:22] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Hey, speaking of, I'm gonna go grab Ir - she probably oughtta be here for this, right? Sitting out there's gotta be getting boring."
[11:23] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "If she's cooking, don't interrupt her. I skipped dinner."
[11:23] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "A Circle. An entire Circle. Another entire Circle. Troublesome. Ominous. Where are you based? Or going, maybe?"
[11:23] <03trenchfoot> 13She nods, the picture of seriousness. "If she's cooking I'll grab you something on my way back." 13Then she's off to fetch Ir.
[11:23] <03Crion> 4Ir's not cooking. She and Sondok are along shortly.
[11:24] <03Crion> "Yo."
[11:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Another?"
[11:24] <03Crion> 4Ir looks at the guy. "Hey, bugman."
[11:25] <03dammitwho> "Ir, this is Azer'jol."
[11:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Hey, Azer'jol." 4Looks a lot more normal than she'd have guessed.
[11:26] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "He eats corpses and hates Heaven."
[11:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Well I'm all about half of that."
[11:27] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying nods. "The corpse-eating thing was a real turn-off, yeah."
[11:27] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Oh, yes. Lots of trouble your kind have been making in the - hello - in the river province. Poking at the nameless lair, blasting the top off Metagalpa, making some kind of bid at Nexus... noisy."
[11:27] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Not that I mind. Draws attention away."
[11:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A bid at Nexus?"
[11:27] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Our kind? You gotta be--"
[11:27] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "I don't spend much time there. There is some kind of... disagreement."
[11:29] <03Crion> "You're the same as us; you just fuck with the Moon."
[11:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "They're aggravating Ma-Ha-Suchi?" 10He's been getting a lot of mileage out of his incredulous voice tonight. "I suppose afterwards they'll be soliciting Raksi as a nursemaid?"
[11:33] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol barks out several laughs. "Hah! Yes. But in all seriousness, probably so."
[11:33] <03Crion> 4Ir blinks. "Metagalpa -- the big-ass bird mountain? The floating one? That's actually real?"
[11:33] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol: "Yes. Though I have never been, I've seen it from a distance."
[11:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What's it look like from a distance?"
[11:34] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods along thoughtfully.
[11:34] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol: "Big mountain, but you can see trees and things behind it because of the gap."
[11:34] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Imagine a mountain that's been ripped out of the ground and shoved up half a league."
[11:35] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol: "At any rate I do not have all night. You will leave me be, I trust?"
[11:36] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying says nothing, but... weren't they just talking about this? Although I guess the mountain probably doesn't move...
[11:36] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol: "If so, and if you tell me where you'll be found in the coming months, I can... pass your names along. Allow for contact."
[11:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "My guy, you have just as long as we decide you have. Let's be real."
[11:36] <03Crion> "That said..."
[11:37] <03Crion> 4To the Circle: "Which one of us is dealing with the morticians? It ain't gonna be me."
[11:43] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We can just tell them we've made sure it won't continue past tomorrow."
[11:43] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi sighs theatrically. "I'll do it."
[11:46] <03Ferrinus> 12Azer'jol: "Many thanks. The Pact will know of your agreeable... ness... here."
[11:46] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Take it easy, bugboy."
[11:46] <03Ferrinus> 12Later, Eikichi finds himself being cross-examined by a series of anxious Sijanese bureaucrats. Did you find it? What was it? Did you stop it? How did you stop it? How can we be sure you stopped it? What if-
[11:46] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying waves with both hands. "Bye!"
[11:47] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi is breezy and arrogant. It's fine, he says. We weren't able to save this corpse, and the next one's good as gone, but after that this particular blight will trouble the Funerary Order no more, and they can, aheh, put the matter to rest.
[11:48] <03dammitwho> 7Much later, when the cross-examination is over and the Heavensward is lifting off, bound for Nexus: "Okay, now that's done with- what's with these bags of dead beetles, Eikichi?"
[11:48] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi tries to pretend the question surprises him. "I'm sorry?"
[11:49] <03trenchfoot> 13Oh! Oh this is going to be good. Tatsuya was curious too but he's not going to get to find out because he was rude.
[11:49] <03dammitwho> 7She holds one up, the 'Just in case' tag still tied on it.
[11:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh."
[11:49] <03VoxPVoxD> "Ah."
[11:49] <03VoxPVoxD> "Well."
[11:49] <03VoxPVoxD> "...did you like the gifts I got you?"
[11:50] <03Crion> 4Ir's at the helm, wearing the robed smock that she's become accustomed to wearing around the ship in lieu of armor. She's marked out a course south-by-southeast.
[11:51] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Yes! They were very nice."
[11:53] <03Ferrinus> 12The Sijanese are convinced, for the most part, and those that aren't get shouted down or shooed by their superiors. And, indeed, the rash of graverobbings does stop by the following night - clearly, it was some kind of autonomous curse that the solars' magic was able to dissipate, or something like that.
[11:53] <03Crion> 4All's well that whatevers well.
[11:53] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well... originally there was a third gift. I thought it'd be nice to keep some docile pets on board, who'd eat all the sawdust and little unmeltable shavings that come from your projects."
[11:54] <03VoxPVoxD> "But, I wasn't... I wasn't thinking clearly."
[11:54] <03VoxPVoxD> "So the ultimate conclusion, of giving you a bag of smith's friend eggs that would eventually hatch and crawl all over the ship,"
[11:54] <03Ferrinus> 12So it is that the Squared Circle leaves in high spirits and good standing. It's only a matter of days before they can see Nexus in the distance, mostly by the haze of smoke and steam above it, and the closer they get the more they apprehend the great city's sheer size and noise and density.
[11:54] <03VoxPVoxD> "Didn't... occur to me, exactly, until later."
[11:55] <03Crion> 4Ir will call out "land ho" when the city's in sight.
[11:55] <03VoxPVoxD> "I guess some of them ended up in the other bags, somehow."
[11:55] <03Crion> 4After all, she doesn't know where the hell they're landing. That's on Blossom.
[11:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is nobly repressing laughter. "Well... that was... thoughtful."
[11:56] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Aaaaugh."
[11:56] <03VoxPVoxD> "They didn't get on the mouth guard, right? Please tell me they didn't get on the mouth guard."
[11:57] <03Ferrinus> 12You can see the yellow river stretching from your right to your left, all the roads and rivulets by which trade of every sort runs into and out of the metropolis. Once you're close enough to follow the river through 12the city, you're close enough to start using the landmarks and measurements Blossom's been appraised of, slowing and lowering the Heavensward so that it's wendings 
[11:57] <03Ferrinus> 12its way over the normal trading vessels below it and searching for the dock that's been made ready for it.
[11:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom chortles. "It's fine. Oh, relax. I'm only teasing you. Tell me about the pendant!"
[11:57] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying is cackling as she flees, stealth abandoned because oh my god. Now to figure out how Tatsuya will never learn of this, as a form of revenge.
[11:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Nexus. What a pisshole.
[11:58] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Oh! I was hoping you'd be able to corroborate, actually, but I think the pendant is a calendar."
[11:58] <03Ferrinus> 12Your approach to the city isn't all that scandalous, it seems. Some people look up and gasp, sure, but the streets are unusually empty, the crowds unusually thin, as you approach. As you get deeper into the city, you realize why - masses of people are clustering closer and closer to a particular city square still a little ways ahead of you - a city square which, it must be said, 
[11:58] <03Ferrinus> 12appears to house a miles-high pillar of golden light.
[11:58] <03Crion> 4Ir's keeping an eagle eye on the buildings and sky around them.
[11:59] <03Ferrinus> 12Perhaps more than one? It's hard to count with all the associated visual noise, since there are elemental animas and the contrails of what seem to be active sorcery, too.
[11:59] <03Crion> 4Would be kinda fucked up if the Heavensward went down because someone lit arrows on fire and took a shot at her sails.
[11:59] <03dammitwho> 7Neat.
[11:59] <03Ferrinus> 12Actually, the closer you get the more convinced you are that there's some kind of knock-down, drag-out fight going on.
[12:00] <03Crion> 4Well then.
[12:02] <03Ferrinus> 12Soon you're close enough to get distant images of some of the participants - a thin woman with purple robes and grey hair, a hugely muscled and heavily scarred shouting man, an old bald guy with a sword. It's hard to tell what's been going on, what with the destruction all around them - looks like some kind of debate or speech turned into a performance turned into a fight with various 
[12:02] <03Ferrinus> 12Dragon-Blooded, some of them dynasts, and Guild guardsmen, and a gigantic golem, or something, and there's just crowds and crowds of onlookers... but there is, also, a cloaked figure striding into the scene around whom the animas are parting like seas before a sorcerer.
[12:03] <03Crion> 4Ir, into the inter-deck piping: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nexus. Take off your safety belts and get out on deck, because we're coming in hot."
[12:03] <03Ferrinus> 12A thin, cold voice echoes throughout the city, perfectly audible even at your altitude and even through the shouting and violence: "None shall obstruct trade."
[12:03] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Ohhhhh dear."
[12:03] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "It's fortunate that absolutely none of this has anything to do with us."
[12:03] <03Ferrinus> 12There's a terrible shrieking, tearing sound, and everything's searing crimson and painful to look at, and the entire battlefield's suddenly nothing more than smears - red gore and black ash.
[12:04] <03Ferrinus> 12...ah, and there's your dock. Welcome to Nexus!
[12:04] <03Crion> 
[12:04] <03Crion> 4FUCK
[12:04] <03Crion> 4Okay, okay, didn't hit anything.
[12:04] <03Crion> 4Ir spares a glance over her shoulder, back towards that square. Is that golden pillar of light...?
[12:04] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, staring at the carnage, eyes wide and shining: "Wow."
[12:05] <03VoxPVoxD> "That's the Emissary."
[12:05] <03Ferrinus> 12The Squared Circle lands, finds accomodations, and gets comfy in the center of the River Province... next week.

[22:22] <03Quaker> KJ gets a text early in the evening. <you up?> It’s Frances. 
[22:23] <03Quaker> Tommy wakes up from a strange dream. He’s on his back, in the basement of the church in San Juan. The room is dark, as usual. Something’s changed. 
[22:26] <03tom> "Oof." 14He opens his eyes, scans the darkened room, and picks himself up off the floor.
01[22:27] <03banana> 6KJ's up. She'd like to stay up more, though the Mekhet blood objects - now that sleep is such an artificial thing it feels wasted, a missed opportunity for- whatever
01[22:27] <03banana> 6KJ: <Yeah!>
01[22:27] <03banana> 6KJ: <Just thinking about how to do ESP, get revenge on my enemies, etc 📯>
[22:29] <03Quaker> In the dark place beneath the Columbia Building, Cav readies himself for a sort of proving. The great wide garden is empty. There are only five people besides him down here, and only four who have any official standing. The last is a guest. The four give him a wide berth. What will he attempt to do here, tonight? 
[22:30] <03Quaker> The fifth, a Nosferatu baron, politely declines to be seen. 
[22:30] <03tom> 14The deacon makes it up the stairs before too long. What's changed?
[22:32] <03Quaker> Before he goes, Tommy notices something. There’s several broad beams running across the length of the basement floor. Nobody ever bothered to cover it up…but he can see that someone has written something up on one of them, in the corner of the room. He’s not tall enough to just walk over and look clearly at it. 
[22:33] <03tom> 14Well, he can get a chair.
[22:33] <03tom> 14And in fact, does so.
[22:35] <03Crion_> 4At first he had considered doing something ill-advised and painful. To show his devotion.
[22:35] <03Crion_> 4But frankly, that doesn't prove anything, and no one wants to see that.
[22:37] <03Quaker> Frances: <I got kind of a strange…message…an invitation?> 
[22:38] <03Crion_> 4So instead, he's brought an acoustic guitar. "I've never played this instrument before in my life."
[22:38] <03Crion_> "I've seen it played. I know what it looks like, when it's played properly."
[22:38] <03Crion_> "But I've never played it before myself. Never practiced it. Never touched it before tonight. If I'm lying, I'm dying."
[22:39] <03Crion_> 4Leisurely can attest to this if she pleases. Cav's telling the truth.
01[22:40] <03banana> 6KJ: <Please, F, tell me it wasn't from a weird old stoner called Leisurely.> 6Tonight KJ has vague plans about checking in on the administration of the barony, maybe activating the bug on Baron Laguna's computers or maybe deleting it, sending messages of thanks to some people for she's not even sure what..
[22:41] <03Quaker> Nobody looks to doubt him. It’s not the kind of place where you dare to lie. 
[22:43] <03Crion_> "My studies have been concentrated in the field of spontaneous phenomenal autodidactism. The art -- the act -- of learning not through practice over time or from a teacher, but through altering my consciousness to rapidly apply observed skills to my own neural and muscle memory."
[22:44] <03Crion_> 4He pauses. "Previous to this, my greatest success has been learning to use chopsticks."
[22:44] <03Crion_> "So this is a step up, in difficulty."
[22:44] <03Quaker> When Tommy pulls the chair up, he can see that something’s been carved into the wood. At first glance he can just see the first clumsy attempts, all gouged out with something dull. When he looks closer, he sees the three words have been carved over and over, in waves and spirals, all following the grain and whorls of the wood. The words repeat over and over, along the length of the beam. The words are: 
[22:44] <03Quaker> YOU CAME BACK
[22:45] <03Quaker> Frances: <No…it didn’t say who it was from. Just an address and a time. I’d go, but…I’m afraid to go by myself.> 
[22:45] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "If this goes well, you'll know it. If it doesn't go well, you'll also know that."
[22:46] <03Crion_> 4Deep breath. "I'm going to begin."
[22:46] <03tom> 14Tommy grabs his phone off the nightstand and begins taking pictures.
[22:49] <03Crion_> 4At first it doesn't look like Cav's doing much of anything, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that he's blinking almost too fast to track. Then his lips begin moving, mouthing words without making sounds, and his hands shudder as he reaches out and runs contorting, seizuring fingers up and down the neck of the guitar.
[22:49] <03tom> 14He climbs down off the chair and thumbs through his photograph roll, trying to puzzle it out.
[22:49] <03Crion_> 4It becomes obvious what this is after a few moments: this is some strange form of Frenzy.
[22:51] <03Crion_> 4Suddenly he jacks knife once, twice, and falls off the stool.
[22:52] <03Crion_> "I'm okay!"
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ isn't sure where the hell she's going thesedays - sorry, thesenights. She rolls her eyes at an inner Teresa. But she's pretty sure it involves taking friends with her, or vice versa, so- <I'm 100% on the way. You sure it isn't just a secret admirer?>
[22:52] <03Crion_> "That hurt."
[22:53] <03tom> 14He's still trying to wrap his head around it as he's coming up the stairs onto the main floor of the mission.
[22:53] <03Crion_> 4Cav coughs. "I think...I think it worked."
[22:53] <03tom> 14Soria might be willing to help him out.
[22:53] <03Quaker> Soria isn’t around. 
[22:53] <03Crion_> 4He gets up and sits back on the stool, picks up the guitar...
[22:53] <03tom> 14Hm.
[22:54] <03Crion_> 4..And expertly, efficiently checks the tuning, adjusting the pegs until the instrument is back in tune.

[22:56] <03Crion_> "Okay. Alright. Here we go." 4He looks up and around the room. "Now, keep in mind: I didn't teach myself to sing."
[22:56] <03Crion_> 4He takes a deep breath and begins to strum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21exnGWN-uI
[22:56] <03Quaker> Frances: <idk. usually they don’t tend to leave business cards on your nightstand.> She texts KJ a picture. It’s a plain and white square of cardstock. 1280 Leiden Street. 1 A.M. You may bring two guests. 
[22:57] <03Quaker> Frances: <you wouldnt know anyone who’s pretty big and fierce and would want to go, would you>

01[23:02] <03banana> 6KJ: <Ugh, I haven't got enough minions yet. We could invite Wesley, or there's a carmelite I met who is into some metal shit (spells made of bird skulls)>
[23:02] <03tom> 14Tommy ambles into the freezer room and comes out with a chilled, mercifully opaque bag covered in obscure medical nomenclature. He returns to the main kitchenette and pokes a hole in the bag with a toothpick.
01[23:02] <03banana> 6KJ: <Like I assume you want people who're trustworthy here, that cuts things down a lot.> 6She's thinking about the mysterious gifts left on her own doorstep, too. Maybe there's a reason electronic surveillance seems disregarded in this town.

[23:03] <03Crion_> 4He lets the last notes hang, then puts the guitar down. "And...that's spontaneous phenominal autodidactism. I'm still working on the name."
[23:04] <03Crion_> 4Clinton Cavanaugh looks utterly, absolutely drained, and is soaked in sweat.
[23:04] <03tom> 14He spends a longer-than-average amount of time staring at the fine sheet rock making up the mission's counter while the bloodbag thaws.
[23:06] <03tom> 14He picks up his phone, swipes out of the photo rolls and goes to make an audio recording: "Reminder: need to speak with Father Soria on the topic of 'grace'."
[23:06] <03Crion_> 4He could also mention that it doesn't last -- when he wakes up the following night, he'll once again be unable to play the guitar -- but no reason to volunteer the kinks that still need to be worked out.
[23:06] <03Quaker> The Nosferatu baron, the only one here from the outside, watches. The performance appears, at first, to be painfully unskilled. But the others don’t move, even when he convulses and falls to the floor. It seems that this is in the realm of expected things for them. The Gangrel’s music begins to form together into something pleasant. The walls of the room seem smaller. As he gets to the second verse, the Nosferatu can smell 
[23:06] <03Quaker> something. And hear something, behind the music. 
[23:07] <03Quaker> The walls convulse, too. 
[23:08] <03Quaker> Frances: <bird skulls seem like it’s appropriate for this. and it’s better if they’re not…connected. this isn’t exactly approved of. you should keep it to youself btw> 
01[23:09] <03banana> 6KJ picks up a second phone and her curiosity.
[23:10] <03Quaker> The sound from the guitar seems to be quieter and quieter. For Wilson, at least, the other sound seems to be growing, drowning it out. If he looks around, he can see that the garden around him looks…faded. Fading, actually. What’s going on? Cav seems too focused to notice. The noise grows louder. 
[23:10] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyP9_O4RuSw
01[23:10] <03banana> <I'm looping him in. You know more than you're telling me Frances ☢☢☢>
[23:11] <03Quaker> Frances: <ive gathered that its the kind of thing that the less you know, the better. but no reward without risk. they have some interesting things, i’m told. bring money if you’re curious> 
01[23:11] <03banana> 6To Saldana: <Hey we were going to do the book thing. I've got something slightly odd which might not be related, whatever, tonight good?>
[23:13] <03VoxPVoxD> 10That's unusual.
[23:14] <03Quaker> Cav and Wilson are the only things not changing. The world seems to be going away. At one moment, they can smell the fragrances of the garden, and see the Ordo members sitting in the pavilion. The next, they’re alone. The sound remains. The garden begins to disappear. 
[23:14] <03VoxPVoxD> 10uh
[23:15] <03tom> <into it> 14Comes the first text, followed by like twenty others each no longer than a handful of words, and never approaching a complete sentence.  <when> <im using lyft now> <did you see the news> <i cant get anywhere it sucks>
[23:15] <03Crion_> 4Cav is almost too tired to react.
[23:15] <03Quaker> They’re in a new place. 
[23:16] <03Quaker> Cav and Wilson are on a broad tiled road. The tile continues on in front of them. 
[23:17] <03Quaker> In front of them, the small road lies between two fields, each full with withered vermilion flowers. It ends at the beginning of the marble balustrades and facades of the pavilion.
[23:18] <03Quaker> The white columns and walls of the main building reflect the bright light of an absent sun. The temple glitters, and from a distance Wilson can see the fine gold tracery in its eaves and edges. Its roof rises, in a thin column, into the pale red sky, until it disappears from sight.
[23:18] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Can Cavanaugh walk?
[23:20] <03Quaker> Sure. Neither of them are injured. 
[23:20] <03Crion_> 4Yyeah.
[23:20] <03Crion_> "Woah."
01[23:21] <03banana> 6KJ sends Tommy the image of the business card, rather than OCR the address. She doesn't bother to repeat the thing about bringing money, even though she's grabbing a credit card and a few wads of cash out of a safe herself, because she assumes he hasn't got any.
[23:21] <03tom> 14At any rate, Tommy will be there at- well, roughly around the designated time. Plus or minus a few.
01[23:21] <03banana> <News? What news?>
[23:21] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Then he sees Wilson there, hands in his pockets, face carefully set. "I'm guessing this wasn't part of the show."
[23:21] <03Crion_> "Not the one I was putting on."
01[23:21] <03banana> 6Frances, too, gets interrogated as to whehther something's up with traffic. KJ's kind of appalled that she's this far out of the loop of 'normal person' news.
[23:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks ahead, at the temple. "But where have we come, and where shall we end?" 10He starts walking forward.
[23:24] <03Crion_> 4Cav just follows him in silence, still looking around.
03[23:25] * Joins: Crion| (Crion@sorcery-00t34t.fios.verizon.net)
[23:26] <03Quaker> The road leads to a short staircase.The steps are wide and flat. After twenty, they’re standing in the only room in the building.

[23:29] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Are we...still underground?"
[23:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "No idea."
[23:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Are Wilson and Cavanaugh alone in here?
01[23:31] <03banana> 6Oh, they got Kalanick. Whatever, the writing was on the wall there.. but it's funny, thinking about SF. This address KJ's on the way to, the card, the wink-wink-nudge-nudge nobody's supposed to know thing- it reminds her of the Latitude. Of the Bak-Ra.
[23:32] <03Quaker> No. There are four things and one person in here. On three marble plinths there are three figures reclined on their back, not moving and covered with white shrouds. On the fourth, there is a rotary telephone. Sitting in a chair aside all these things is Clinton Cavanaugh, or at least a perfect double of him. His eyes are closed, and he only sits and breathes. 
[23:33] <03Crion_> 4...
[23:34] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Okay.
[23:35] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Before you ask. No. I don't have a twin."
[23:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That's concerning."
[23:43] <03Quaker> Frances: <I’ll pick you up. just forward his address and i’ll have the driver stop by there too> 
[23:45] <03tom> 14Tommy's at the curb when the car pulls up, in a thick cloud of vapor, pulling out his earbuds and quickly stuffing them into his baggy hoodie's pockets.
[23:46] <03tom> 14He climbs into the car and shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
[23:46] <03Quaker> The limousine stops by the curb. When Tommy opens the door, Frances and KJ are already inside. 
[23:46] <03tom> "Hey."
01[23:47] <03banana> 6KJ won't object to the lift. This is Frances' show to some extent, and hey, she could always run home. She speculates about what may be on Leiden Street until it's time to introduce- wait, will Yuan object to a Nosferatu? Maybe this was a bad idea.
[23:47] <03Quaker> The other baroness looks him over, and doesn’t seem too put off. “Hello. You’re Baron Valentine’s friend? Oh, right. You were at the…thing, earlier.” 
[23:48] <03Quaker> The phone rings in the pavilion. 
[23:48] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Which one of us do you suppose that's for?"
01[23:48] <03banana> "Hey, Saldana! This is Frances Baron Garden Grove. She's" 6(meaningfully "cool."
[23:49] <03VoxPVoxD> "Dunno. I'll answer it."
[23:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10He does.
[23:51] <03Quaker> The loud noise seems to die down for a bit. “Cavanaugh.” It’s a voice only one of them has heard before. 
[23:52] <03Quaker> The voice on the other end comes from the air. They can both hear it as if someone were in the room with them. 
[23:52] <03tom> "Tommy Saldana," 14he rasps, taking a final puff on the pen before tossing it and extending a hand.
[23:52] <03tom> "I'm a Deacon now, so they've gotta re-do all the lettering in the office."
[23:52] <03tom> 14He neither has an office or any lettering that would need re-doing.
[23:53] <03Quaker> Frances shakes it. “I don’t think there will be any need for any rough-and-tumble stuff, you know? But it pays to be prepared. And you’re into the whole…occult…thing, right? KJ said you were.” 
[23:53] <03tom> "I've seen some weird shit, yes."
01[23:54] <03banana> 6KJ looks to be in a good mood. She's wearing something like a upmarket onesie and an ankh earring (to get into the spirit of things). "Superstition is the new faith, right?"
[23:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Okay.
[23:56] <03Quaker> The last time Cav heard this voice, Kevin McMahon was saying his goodbyes. 
[23:57] <03Crion_> "Hello, Kevin."
[23:57] <03Crion_> 4Cav glances over at Wilson.
[23:58] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's face is blank.
[23:58] <03VoxPVoxD> 10He offers Cav the phone, as if that means anything.
[23:58] <03Crion_> 4He'll take it.
[23:59] <03Crion_> "Where are -- where are you calling from, Kevin?"
[23:59] <03tom> "Yeah," 14Tommy nods. "I can appreciate a bit of mysticism-chic, or whatever, y'know-" 14he gestures at the ankh earrings. 
Session Time: Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 2017
01[00:01] <03banana> 6KJ: "I mean, this might be entirely inappropriate. Ffffrances. You said 'the less you know the better..' I've got to say, I have spent my entire life living by the opposite credo."
[00:02] <03Quaker> The voice on the other line: “How…am I talking to you? How…am I…Cavanaugh?” Wilson can still hear everything, as if there were a person instead of a telephone. 
[00:02] <03Crion_> 4Cav turns to look at 'himself.' Has that guy moved at all?
[00:03] <03Quaker> Frances: “I don’t think there’s a dress code.” 
[00:03] <03Quaker> He has not. 
[00:04] <03tom> "Oh, yeah, I guess... I'm not really a suit guy, y'know?"
[00:04] <03tom> "That's not a problem, right?"
01[00:04] <03banana> 6KJ: "If it's good enough for Mass.."
[00:04] <03Quaker> Frances sits back in the plush seating. “I think that at a certain point, you either have what they want, or you don’t.” 
[00:05] <03Crion_> "Are you Kevin McMahon?"
[00:06] <03Quaker> McMahon: “…Yes…” It comes out as a gasp. “I’m…I think I’m bleeding…where…are you…” 
[00:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "I don't know."
[00:06] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Did you ever leave, Kevin?"
[00:07] <03Crion_> "Did you ever get out of the city?"
[00:07] <03Quaker> Frances: “We’ll be there soon.” 
01[00:07] <03banana> 6KJ: "I don't really like being.. judged."
[00:08] <03Quaker> McMahon: “Back…to New York…a few days…I saw them, Cavanaugh. Without…” 
[00:08] <03Quaker> The voice seems to crack, as if it’s failing to hold back tears. “The fog…Listen, Cavanaugh. The fog…it’s all a lie…” 
[00:11] <03Crion_> 4Cav throws up his hands in frustration. "What fog, Kevin?"
[00:12] <03Quaker> The limousine stops in a quiet strip mall. The phone GPS says its somewhere in Santa Ana. At this time of night, there doesn’t seem to be anyone out on the streets. 1280 Leiden is an unmarked storefront between a chinese restaurant and an accounting office. 
[00:15] <03Quaker> McMahon: “When you get old enough. Listen.” The voice seems to make an effort to pull itself together. “Can’t make sense of anything anymore. I’m…gone. Listen to me, Cavanaugh. The torpor. When you get old enough. It’s not true. There’s nothing. It’s inside us. The Shepherds are…not our shepherds. They work for the thing inside us. I’m…sorry…” 
01[00:16] <03banana> 6Is there a door? Most of the shops around here have grates or rollups over them at this time of night.
[00:16] <03Crion_> "Torpor -- what --"
[00:19] <03Quaker> There is. It’s not barred or anything, except for the man standing outside. He raises an arm and directs them inside. The foyer is bare of any decoration, and quite shabby. The floor seems to be stained carpet. There’s a faint odor of cigarette smoke. Behind a glass aperture, a bored-looking woman looks up. “Invitation?” 
01[00:21] <03banana> 6It's Frances's show. KJ's barely visible, in fact, out of habit and caution.
[00:21] <03Quaker> McMahon: “You have to take it out of you. I don’t know how. I don’t….oh, christ…I think I’m…” 
[00:21] <03Quaker> The voice on the line screams. The line disconnects. 
[00:22] <03Crion_> "Kevin!"
[00:22] <03Crion_> 4Well, shit.
[00:22] <03Quaker> Frances looks back at her two companions and slips the card to the secretary. “Yuan, and two guests.” 
[00:23] <03Quaker> The secretary slides the card into a folder. “Wait here until your name is called. Then it’s just through the door.” 
[00:23] <03tom> 14The Deacon makes sure to leisurely roll down the window and rest an arm tapping the outside of the door.
[00:24] <03Quaker> Blood is leaking from the receiver of the telephone. 
[00:24] <03Crion_> 4For a brief, insane moment, Cav is seized with the urge to taste it.
[00:24] <03Crion_> 4Instead he throws the thing across the room.
01[00:24] <03banana> 6KJ raises her eyebrows. If this whole thing's a trap, it's a very professional trap.
[00:25] <03Quaker> Frances sits back down on a beaten metal folding chair. “Well. This seems pretty…okay.” 
01[00:26] <03banana> 6KJ: "Secret society of dentists."
[00:26] <03tom> "Is that what this is."
[00:28] <03Quaker> Frances: “I think it’s more of a…well. The person who tipped me off said it was a place where you could buy certain things. Hard to find things. I was curious. And then - I mean, its not like I called them. It just showed up yesterday night. The card.” 
[00:28] <03Quaker> The speakers in the waiting room sound. “Yuan.” 
[00:28] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson watches it go.
[00:29] <03Quaker> There’s a click behind the door they’re waiting for. Frances looks at Tommy. “Maybe you should go through first. Just in case.” 
[00:29] <03VoxPVoxD> "Fog of Ages, is what he meant. Torpor dementia."
[00:30] <03Quaker> In the pavilion, it’s just them, and the four bodies, three covered and one sitting. 
[00:30] <03tom> 14Tommy sniffs, nods, adopts a serene expression and brushes some errant lint off his hoodie. "But of course."
[00:31] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Well, I feel plenty demented."
[00:31] <03tom> 14Tommy turns and, half-expecting to receive a shotgun blast for his efforts, politely steps through the door and holds it open.
[00:31] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah."
01[00:32] <03banana> 6KJ's grinning at Tommy as he goes. It's a chance to show off, right? And they're just dentists probably. 
[00:33] <03Crion_> "And what the fuck are all of--" 4Cav strides over and pulls the sheet off the nearest body.
[00:36] <03Quaker> Some of the occupants of the room turn to look. They can see: a large room, quite unadorned, with cheap linoleum floors and bare white walls. In the center of the floor is about forty or so metal folding chairs. Half of them have occupants. They seem…a bit off. There’s a…man? With a grinning skeleton’s skull where his head should be. He nods politely. A woman with huge, rough stitches traveling up and down her neck and 
[00:36] <03Quaker> face, dressed in a nice business suit. A huge wolf, its head wreathed in mist and smoke, laying down to the side of the chairs. A man that seems to be a large number of rats in a jacket. 
01[00:37] <03banana> 6It's real, then.
[00:37] <03Quaker> At the front of the room, another man stands in front of them, his hands raised and his fingers extending and bending, like a composer. He seems to be waiting a few seconds between each twitch. He has no features on his face. 
[00:37] <03tom> 14Tommy makes finger pistols at Skull-guy.
[00:38] <03tom> 14The deacon murmurs something about 'Monster Mash'.
[00:38] <03Quaker> To his side, watching the audience, is a young woman in a long black dress, with short blonde-red hair. She looks a bit detached from it all. 
[00:39] <03Quaker> The shroud comes off the body. Wilson and Cav look down at Wilson Frost, before his disfigurement. His eyes look up sightlessly at nothing. 
[00:39] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson stares.
[00:39] <03Crion_> 4Cav goes over to the next. And the next.
01[00:40] <03banana> 6KJ's face and posture are totally different from the moment before they stepped through the door. She thanks Tommy politely for holding the door open, nose up and smile gone, and goes straight for the chairs intended for the audience (the auctionees?). 
[00:42] <03Quaker> The skull-guy makes a clacking noise that might be laughter, and turns back, raising his hand. The faceless man’s last extended finger lowers. From the…well, somewhere, a man’s voice comes out through speakers. “The bidding on this item has ended. Please allow us a few minutes while we prepare the next sale. Mr. de Blancy, please speak to our manager’s assistant for collection information. The Auction will resume 
[00:42] <03Quaker> shortly.” 
[00:43] <03Quaker> The second body is Clinton Cavanaugh, still boyish. 
[00:43] <03Quaker> The third is
[00:44] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson hisses and recoils as if from the sun itself.
[00:45] <03Quaker> Skull-guy gets up to speak to the woman in the black dress. The rest look around and either talk to each other or browse their phones. 
[00:49] <03Crion_> 4As soon as he takes the sheet off the third body, he makes a guttering, choking noise and puts it back on. She's a beautiful brunette in her late thirties. Dressed up like a lawyer.
[00:51] <03Crion_> 4Do any of these...things have Beasts?
01[00:52] <03banana> 6To Frances: "In case we need to combine forces- are you expecting any particular item?"
[00:52] <03Quaker> None of them do. They seem…inert. 
[00:54] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "Okay. Okay."
[00:55] <03Crion_> 4Cav: "First, we get out of here. Maybe this is some sort of...Ordo test, or something."
[00:55] <03Crion_> "Hopefully that's all it is."
[00:55] <03Crion_> "But if it's not--"
[00:55] <03Crion_> "We don't tell anyone about this. Not until we figure out what's going on."
[00:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sure."
[00:59] <03Quaker> KJ peers into the people around her, and sees…not much. They all seem to have their energies hugged close. Except the manager’s assistant at the front, who doesn’t make any effort at all to conceal hers. Her black aura seems to regularly shift to a lighter gray before darkening back, and both are shot through with a galaxy of sparkling, glittering shimmers. 
[01:05] <03Quaker> Cavanaugh in the chair moves. Or rather, his mouth opens in a silent scream. He doesn’t say anything, though. His eyes seem to be narrowed in anger. 
[01:07] <03Crion_> 4Cav takes a few steps back. He's trying to keep his eyes on these...dolls? Mannequins? While he looks for a way out.
[01:12] <03Quaker> Frances: “No - well, I’ve never been here. I don’t really know what they have.” 
[01:16] <03Quaker> The disemodied voice sounds again. “Welcome to the new arrivals. Our next item is the collected journals of the mage known professionally as Phocas. The bid will begin at a small portion of your love for yourself.” A small murmur runs through the audience. They seem to be slightly embarrassed. The faceless man raises a hand, and a card table with some leather-bound books seems to slowly materialize on the cleared stage. His 
[01:16] <03Quaker> hands raise, and the fingers are all extended. 
[01:17] <03Quaker> “Bidding on this item has begun.” 
[01:17] <03Quaker> In every direction he looks, Cav can only see the endless red fields. 
[01:20] <03Quaker> The young woman raises her hand repeatedly. The faceless man ignores her. No one else bids. 
[01:21] <03Crion_> 4This better not be a thing where he has to kill himself. The other himself.
[01:25] <03Quaker> The collection of rats next to KJ clear their throats. 
[01:25] <03Quaker> “Bidding on this item has ended.” The young woman looks like she’s heard this before. She seems to shrink, and takes her place beside the faceless man once more. 
[01:29] <03Quaker> The roar of the fans seems to rise once more. Cavanaugh in the chair turns his head from side to side. Cav can see his eyes more clearly now - small dark irises in enormous yellow pupils. They are blazing blanknesses. He can feel things from them. Rage. Insanity. The smell of blood is very strong here. Cavanaugh’s eyes seem to glitter in the dim light of the red sun. 
[01:30] <03Quaker> Cavanaugh speaks. 
[01:31] <03Quaker> “It is strange,” he says, “that the eye can love what the mind and body hate.”

[08:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12The bedding at the Scarlet Palace would really be living up to the place's name if it wasn't for the diligent and concerted efforts of Eikichi and Ying at changing dressings, applying medicinal herbs, and generally displaying good bedside manner.
[08:19] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, for her part, has fallen asleep next to a book or journal she had been drawing in most of the night, which is presumably helping in some way.
[08:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12As is, the room you've sequestered the sleeping "Swan" in is basically clean and livable, and you might even be safe to leave the man alone for the rest of the night. That means the Circle is free to discuss their next moves, or advance time to the following morning such that their guest has hopefully woken up, or whatever else. What's the plan?
[08:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's probably going to end up sleeping in shifts with Ying, and taking first shift by falling asleep at Swan's bedside.
[08:24] <03trenchfoot> 13That's... going to have to be fine! Ying will busy herself sketching ideas for an outfit, making sure to keep her notepad well-hidden when it comes time to switch with Eikichi. Hopefully Swan rests easy until then.
[08:26] <03Crion> 4Ir's been hanging out in the common romm, and keeping an eye on the door.
[08:26] <03Crion> 4Someone's bound to come looking sooner or later.
[08:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's a good instinct, but one that isn't necessary yet. The night passes without incident, what with the hotel being empty aside from your circle, your guest, and a few employees, and the following morning the staff are ready with breakfast and other amenities.
[08:28] <03Crion> 4Ir will be snoring on a divan near the door until sun up, and then as soon as the Sun starts clearing the eastern horizon, she'll be up and poking around the kitchen to help with breakfast.
[08:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's probably going to be asleep until someone prods him, or lunch, whichever comes first.
[08:29] <03dammitwho> 7When Blossom wakes, she'll help Ying keep an eye on their guest.
[08:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan first stirs a little ahead of noon. He's in a bad way - no arm, right side of face, torso, and right leg grotesquely mangled. Thankfully, he's still got use of his right eye and seems to be able to hear out of his right ear, though not as well. All the injured(?) tissue is still liable to bleed, ooze, and agonize, though.
[08:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan mutters in what you think is the seatongue in his sleep, though I'm not sure if any of you speak it. Eventually, he groans and wakes. "What... what day...?"
[08:33] <03Crion> 4Ir helps get breakfast prepared and served, and ferries food up from the kitchen to their patient's ersatz room. She's pretty unperturbed by the extent of the injuries.
[08:34] <03Crion> 4You see a lot of shit up North.
[08:34] <03dammitwho> 7What day is it, anyhow?
[08:35] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying hurries to wake Eikichi when Swan begins to stir; she's spent half of the morning organizing their supplies, ensuring they have plenty of balms, bandages, etc. 
[08:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10After Ying wakes Eikichi, they work together to ease his pain and keep him stable. The sorcerer spends some time prodding and studying the wounds. "Remarkable..."
[08:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12I'll say it's Moonday, the second day of Resplendent Water unless I remember it should be different.
[08:39] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Hm?" 13She didn't notice anything particularly unusual... bad burns, but nothing remarkable.
[08:39] <03Crion> "Moonday, second day of Resplendent Water," 4says Ir, delivering a soup.
[08:40] <03Crion> "You. Uh. Need help with it?"
[08:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Whoa, you say it Moonday? Not Moon's Day?"
[08:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "His injuries. Look for the contusions, the burns, the signs of any contingent physical trauma."
[08:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There aren't any."
[08:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan's strong enough to take and drink from the cup, though there's a moment when it shakes in his hand and you begin to intensely regret letting him try. "...thank you. Uggh..."
[08:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12"...thank you. Uggh..." 12
[08:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12Oh come on.
[08:41] <03Crion> 4Ir shrugs. "Not sure there's so much difference. Whoa there." 4Ir's nimble enough to catch the cup.
[08:41] <03trenchfoot> 13Come quickly, nurse, patient's trapped in the narration
[08:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What's the use of feeling, blue?
[08:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi goes on: "These injuries, it's like someone just scrambled him up. Like he was a piece of the Wyld corroded by a raksha."
[08:43] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Effective."
[08:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Unusual."
[08:44] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Repeatable?"
[08:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "We weren't - weren't ready. ...did you find anyone else?"
[08:44] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Have you heard of something like this before?" 13Ying hasn't, but Tatsuya's knowledge of medical history is woefully lacking.
[08:44] <03Crion> "My dude, if you came from where I think you came from, you're a long way from touch-down."
[08:44] <03Crion> "We didn't exactly go looking for anyone else."
[08:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "...then where am I?"
[08:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Not really. I could see it happening in theory, but I've never heard of it happening this way."
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Swan: "You're in the Scarlet Palace, a hotel at the end of the Grand Canal. You crawled out of the Canal last night. We took you in."
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What's your name?" 10Testing his memory.
[08:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "Pretty... pretty far. Thrown...?" 12He blinks hard. "Swan. Told you, didn't I?"
[08:47] <03Crion> 4That's a name?
[08:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods. "Yeah."
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Well, whatever.
[08:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Who else should we be looking for?"
[08:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "P-Panther. He was there with me. He's a big guy, a southerner - I think he took the brunt of it."
[08:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Just you two?"
[08:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "The others weren't there. They should be, should be safe. ...has the council said anything?"
[08:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12You haven't heard anything from the street, but then, you haven't gone looking either.
[08:51] <03Crion> 4Big guy, huh?
[08:51] <03Crion> 4...Probably not so much, anymore.
[08:52] <03dammitwho> "I can find out," 7Blossom offers.
[08:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We're going to go check that right now."
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "I'd ask you to tell Arianna I'm alive... I'm just not sure how you'd find her. Probably gone to ground."
[08:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Someone's got to look for Panther, someone's got to find out what the Council's proclaiming, someone's got to get in touch with the rest of his friends."
[08:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And someone should stay here with him, in case people come looking."
[08:54] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Arianna of Rylea? You're with her? She's one of us?"
[08:54] <03Crion> "Hrrrm."
[08:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'll send a Messenger to Arianna."
[08:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Let me do it. I sold her the coins and left a line of contact, so it won't be out of the blue. She'll be understandably nervous."
[08:57] <03Crion> 4To Swan: "Anyone besides this Panther going to be looking for you?"
[08:57] <03dammitwho> 7To Swan: "Can you tell us enough about her to let us send her a message?"
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12He shuts his eyes for a moment. "She's one of us... a Twilight caste. From the river province. Tall, with silver hair, deep blue eyes..." 12It's fairly clear after the next minute or so that Swan himself isn't really sure what the magic you intend to use requires, and is extremely taken with her.
[09:02] <03dammitwho> 7Aww.
[09:02] <03Crion> 4Hope she's the accepting type.
[09:02] <03Crion> 4Or, you know, Eikichi and Ying are really good.
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12That said, a title like 'Arianna of Rylea' and the knowledge that she's a sorceress in the area should be enough to make sure your Messenger doesn't infallibly deliver your words to someone else.
[09:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's a little disappointed that Blossom's the one making the call here. Oh well, there'll be some other opportunity to meet her.
[09:03] <03Crion> 4No doubt.
[09:03] <03Crion> 4What's that old saying? 'Shooters shoot?'
[09:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What's shooting?
[09:04] <03Crion> 4Blossom will tell you when you're older.
[09:08] <03Crion> 4Ir's still waiting for an answer from Swan. Would be nice to know what flavor the thugs that come looking for him will be in, and whether they'll have warrants.
[09:09] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I'll stay here with Swan. See if I can't help a bit while you guys are gone. If there's three things that need doing, that is."
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan, to Ir: "I don't know. Depends on what they know. It's - this is what happened."
[09:09] <03dammitwho> 7It takes a second, but soon a six-winged miniseraph is speeding away, carrying a message that introduces Excessively Righteous Blossom, and states that Swan is alive but badly injured, being cared for at the Scarlet Palace.
[09:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "We've been... we've long wanted to end the slave trade in Nexus. Among other things. The Guild doesn't like that, obviously."
[09:11] <03Crion> 4Uh oh.
[09:12] <03Crion> 4She glances at Ying. Might be time to get Tatsuya out of his semi-retirement. To what degree is this place Guild-owned?
[09:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "I had plans... but Panther had enough, after a while, couldn't stand waiting any longer. He smashed an auction up, started preaching, wouldn't listen to me... things got out of hand. Especially given... things I'll stay quiet on, for your sake, for now. Just in case."
[09:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "The upshot is, I may be guilty of nothing more than obstructing the Council's justice... and already have served my sentence. But I can't be sure."
[09:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...Well, that presents a problem."
[09:14] <03Crion> "Not for you."\
[09:14] <03Crion> "Well, kind of for you."
[09:15] <03Crion> "But more for us."
[09:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Now that Swan is stabilized, Eikichi flounces into a big chair by Swan's bed, and flips through the book on the table. He squints. He turns the book slightly at an angle. Eventually his eyebrows go up.
[09:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12As far as Tatsuya and Eikichi can tell, this place is not Guild-owned. It's likely that some fraction of their supplies are bought from and perhaps even delivered by the Guild regularly - towels or lamp oil or something - but that's largely insignificant because it's true for many, many places.
[09:18] <03Crion> 4To the two crimesters: "What's our damage look like, in terms of the Guild having access to this place?"
[09:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan nods to Ir, in the meantime. "Yeah, I know what you're thinking. ...might want to just send me back down the river, frankly. But if they haven't started shouting my name or putting up posters you aren't in any danger."
[09:18] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I think we're fine, actually. Unless I missed something...?" 13She glances to Eikichi.
[09:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Oh, it's not what they're going to do to us."
[09:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Urden owns this place outright. Unless it's underwater because of Guild debts, they've got no more access to this place than they do every other building Guild laborers light the lamps and wash the linens in."
[09:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "That's still access. I'll keep an eye on the staff without intruding, but they shouldn't be fool enough to send some mother of two against us with a poison knife. That's just disrespectful."
[09:20] <03Crion> "At least in Pneuma, though, that'd mean we're on the clock."
[09:20] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We're in a reasonably good position. People might search for fugitives before they're hit by the Emissary, but after?"
[09:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "I don't think the Guild knows to look for me, or look out for me. If they do I've screwed up somewhere."
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Unless we find out the Council's calling for their fugitive heads, he's pretty safe."
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Not totally safe but..." 10he shrugs.
[09:22] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "When's the last time we were totally safe, anyway?"
[09:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Golden pillars in the sky. You think the Hunt won't go to the Guild for information?"
[09:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What hunt?"
[09:23] <03Crion> 4Ir: "...what Hunt do you think?"
[09:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Over the next hour or so, the newly awake Swan finishes his soup and makes halting, largely unsuccessful attempts to get out of bed and move around. He's lost a great deal of blood, and Eikichi and Ying deduce that the damage to his torso goes deep enough past the skin that some of Swan's viscera might be molten and tangled to the point of being inoperative. If he doesn't improve, 
[09:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12or worsens, in the next day or so it might mean he needs surgery.
[09:23] <03Crion> "Do y'all not have the Hunt in Nexus?"
[09:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A Wyld Hunt in Nexus is more like than Anathema to get liquefied by the Emissary."
[09:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "No wanton violence means no wanton violence."
[09:24] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "It's super convenient!"
[09:25] <03trenchfoot> "'Cept for the part where, you know." 13She gestures to Swan.
[09:26] <03Crion> "Point is, people like us are currency to the Guild. Even if the Hunt doesn't come walking around, they'll want eyes on us."
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So they have eyes on us. We're not hiding."
[09:26] <03Crion> "No. We're not."
[09:27] <03Crion> 4Ir glances out the window. "That just means it's a matter of time until things go sideways."
[09:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Demons and monsters can't exactly strut through Nexus with impunity because the city has its own bylaws which can be interpreted flexibly if need be, and because the word "wanton" is debatable enough that an ambush or assassination that actually works quickly and effectively is like to slide beneath notice, but the Council of Entities has a definite chilling effect on the kind of 
[09:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12no-limits supernatural brawls that you saw in e.g. Crystal.
[09:30] <03Crion> "Two fellow servants of the Unconquered Sun got blown the fuck up trying to end slavery, a grotesquerie and abomination on mankind's souls. I know where I stand on that."
[09:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Anyway, it's when Swan has gotten back into bed to rest that a shape begins to resolve itself at his bedside. It's vaguely serpentine, but is only visible by virtue of stuff getting sucked into it in order to define its volume - you can see it because of the steam of a nearby kettle, and ashes drawn in from the fireplace in the side of the room, and so on. It's as tall as a man and 
[09:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12has a pair of glowing blue eyes at about the height you'd expect.
[09:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi just watches placidly, Blossom's book in his lap.
[09:31] <03Crion> 4Ir snaps her fingers, and Iscariot coils into a whip around her arm. But she doesn't stop leaning against the wall.
[09:32] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying steps back in an approximation of a fighting stance, bouncing from foot to foot. What's this?
[09:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A familiar. We've gotten a sorcrer's attention. Is this the famous Arianna?"
[09:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12The creature nods. It has a faint and whispery voice: "Can hhhhe be moved?"
[09:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Not wisely. Not yet."
[09:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Though, here's a fun fact: according to the legal custom of Nexus, Swan is currently able-bodied enough to work."
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "That fact isn't fun at all!"
[09:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan manages a single bitter laugh before wincing and clutching at his side with his intact arm. He looks at the elemental, then. "You're all right?" 12It nods. "The others?" 12It shrugs.
[09:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm not sure I like this city of yours."
[09:37] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "It's... got its moments."
[09:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12The elemental turns to the rest of you. "My master... cannot visit safely. She must wait and watch. She bids you care for this one."
[09:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Hang on. Has your master found Panther?"
[09:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elemental: "No. He may not have survived."
[09:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wrinkles his nose in disgust.
[09:40] <03Crion> 4Pity.
[09:40] <03Crion> 4Sounded like he had his head on right.
[09:40] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "...I'm sure we can find him!" 13He might even be alive when we get there!
[09:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Someone should at least look."
[09:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We should look, at any rate."
[09:40] <03Crion> "I volunteer."
[09:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elemental: "Criers... emissaries... I heard no shouts for this one's capture on my way here. I will keep listening, as ordered."
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You should bring Ying, in case he needs medical help."
[09:41] <03Crion> "Will do."
[09:41] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What about Swan?"
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I can stay here with Swan."
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To the elemental: "Oh, before you go."
[09:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Did you curse the hotel?"
[09:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Like, for money?"
[09:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12There's a pause. "My master doesn't know what you mean."
[09:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "An Emerald working to gather up all the foulness and channel it at this spot at the end of the Grand Canal. Emerald working, but Sapphire finesse. It's not something just anyone could've done."
[09:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Another pause. "My master finds this strange. Why bother?"
[09:44] <03Crion> 4Good question.
[09:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't know, maybe you owed someone a favor. I wasn't asking why you did it, just if you did."
[09:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Elemental: "My master hhhhhdenies responsibility."
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, fair enough!"
[09:47] <03Crion> 4Ir closes her eyes. "Guess that means more than one petty sorcerer in town."
[09:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12On the topic of Swan's crusade, here's what the learn-ed members of the Squared Circle know: slavery it outlawed in Nexus, as Nexus is a free city, founded on the principles of liberty and free association.
[09:47] <03Crion> "Should've seen that one coming."
[09:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wellllllll
[09:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Enslaving someone is outlawed in Nexus. You just can't do it. You can, however, bring pre-existing slaves into Nexus, take those slaves back out of Nexus, put those slaves to work in Nexus, sell those slaves to other denizens of Nexus, etcetera.
[09:49] <03@Ferrinus> 12If your slave, in Nexus, does get away, then fair's fair - they beat you and you can't just re-enslave them, as that is illegal. But simply entering Nexus does not render a slave free, and, in practice, even the escape clause (heh) is a moot point because what people do is have their slaves sign contracts of indentured servitude right before going through the gates.
[09:49] <03Crion> 4Ah, contracts.
[09:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi idly wonders what Sondok and Usagi are doing back on the ship.
[09:50] <03@Ferrinus> 12A contract is a contract, after all. To what extent Swan and his people have been opposing this isn't immediately clear, although you're free to ask for the nitty-gritty details.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4There's a real fun thing Ir learned about contracts, back in Pneuma, when she got screwed out of wages for playing at this one tavern.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4They burn.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4And then it's just who's got the bigger sword.
[09:51] <03Crion> 4That night, she didn't. Now? Iscariot's pretty versatile.
[09:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12At any rate, Arianna's elemental servant shakes the soot and steam out of its body such that it's able to melt invisibly back into the air, and then glides back out the window. Presumably it'll be sniffing or listening or something around the hostel grounds.
[09:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "She totally did it."
[09:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Impossible, as she said she didn't.
[09:52] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Yeah. Rude to lie about it."
[09:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Or, at least, her elemental familiar said she didn't.
[09:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't know why she'd deny it, it's really impressive work. I'd love to talk shop with her."
[09:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Probably she thinks we'd be upset about it, 'cause we're staying here."
[09:54] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So I'm guessing freeing the slaves is going to be a four or five step process, so I won't go doing anything about it in the streets unless they break the...what's it called?"
[09:54] <03Crion> "The thing where I goad them into popping off and then can legally kill them."
[09:54] <03Crion> "NA...?"
[09:55] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "The NAP?"
[09:55] <03Crion> "Yeah."
[09:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That's not a real thing."
[09:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's the Fourth Dogma."
[09:55] <03Crion> "Honey, nothing here's a real thing."
[09:55] <03Crion> "That's what's so fucking dangerous about this city. And the Guild."
[09:56] <03Crion> 4To Swan: "Anywhere you can point us to start? Any place Panther might have crawled to on his own?"
[10:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan tries to think. "He'd- ...no, they're still out of town. I guess he was staying at the Rusting Plow most recently but I can't imagine he'd just go back. Honestly, I don't know much about the... you know, the contingencies, the nitty-gritty of his life. He was always a priest of the sun first, everything else a distant second."
[10:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "He came up through the arena, though - I know that. Maybe someone there could tell you more about him."
[10:05] <03Crion> 4Ir grins. "Arena. Seems like a fun place to start."
[10:05] <03Crion> "We'll hit up the Plow, too, if it seems relevant. That a Guild place?"
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks up. "Ying, you should stay here with Swan. I'll go with Ir."
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Ir arches an eyebrow, but doesn't object.
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Been awhile since that's been the split.
[10:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "Not directly. But you know how it is."
[10:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "If I don't, I'm sure I will."
[10:06] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Okay!" 13She doesn't seem surprised by the switch.
[10:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I wonder if they've heard about Crystal down here yet."
[10:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The Guild, I mean."
[10:08] <03Crion> 4Ir: "If they haven't, I'm sure they will."
[10:08] <03Crion> "You ready to go?"
[10:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah." 10He hands Blossom her book.
[10:09] <03Crion> 4Ir snaps her fingers again, and Iscariot slithers back into an intricate lattice of jewelry covering both her otherwise bare arms.
[10:10] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Then let's mosey."
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi just sort of shakes his left arm out like it had fallen asleep, and then he follows Ir out.
[10:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Technically he's still wearing his pajamas but his pajamas are downy turquoise robes that look passably like outside clothes.
[10:12] <03dammitwho> 7She starts a little when she realizes Eikichi has been reading it, but doesn't say anything.
[10:13] <03dammitwho> "Do you want me to stay, Ying? Otherwise I was going to see if Nexus has a legal library."
[10:13] <03Crion> 4Once outside: "You ever heard of any of these guys?"
[10:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I've seen Panther. He won the Rose Grit Games!"
[10:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Just quit the arena one day, walked off with all his winnings. Maybe this was why."
[10:17] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yeah? What's that?"
[10:17] <03Crion> "Huh."
[10:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He was a gladiator. Best I ever saw."
[10:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Kind of like Bergsveinn, but not as pale and with less clothes."
[10:18] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Ooh."
[10:18] <03Crion> "Well."
[10:18] <03Crion> "Probably too late for that now."
[10:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Let's find out."
[10:19] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yep. You take the lead, or don't. Your city. But I'm gonna be real direct."
[10:19] <03Crion> "Seems like this city rewards that to some extent."
[10:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I'd love it, but... more information's probably better. I'll check Swan over again, maybe I'll be done by the time you get back?"
[10:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah. Especially when we're at some kind of disadvantage."
[10:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So, the arena and then the Plow?"
[10:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Or the other way around. Your call. I'd like to see the arena, though."
[10:21] <03Crion> "So I'm fine with that being first."
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Me too."
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To the arena!
[10:22] <03Crion> 4By the time they get there, the moonsilver jewelry will have crept over Ir's knuckles. Like, well. Knuckles.
[10:22] <03dammitwho> "Sure." 7She nods, and heads for the door. She's looking for some place that stores past decisions by the Council and Emissary, ideally with scholarly commentary. There must be one- Nexus' highest laws are simple, and when a law is simple that means most of it is unwritten.
[10:22] <03dammitwho> 7They need to know what the actual rules are, so they know when they're skirting and when they're breaking.
[10:23] <03dammitwho> 7It'd also be nice to know if the Emissary plans on finishing the job.
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't seem to be armed at all, except for the orbs of glass spinning around him at roughly arm's length.
[10:23] <03Crion> 4Don't think anyone's buying that as unarmed, kiddo.
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's a shame.
[10:24] <03dammitwho> 7Maybe he's a juggler.
[10:24] <03Crion> 4Second most dangerous boy Ir ever met was a juggler.
[10:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi definitely can't juggle.
[10:26] <03Crion> 4Can he command the spheres with his mind?
[10:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's never really tried, except to hide them.
[10:26] <03Crion> 4Then when he's ready, he won't need to.
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ah, the arena. The arena, I assume, since Nexus has a few fighting grounds of varying repute littered around but only one actually suited to a gladiator of Panther's stature. It's a great cylinder of crenelated stone with roads radiating out in all directions, and even as they approach Eikichi and Ir can hear the roar of the crowd over even the comparably raucous roar of the Nexus 
[10:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12streets.
[10:31] <03Crion> 4Badass.
[10:31] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So you know how these stories go."
[10:31] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We go to an arena asking questions..."
[10:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12There are relief carvings all around and across the outer walls of the colosseum depicting warriors and beasts in various stages of combat and death; the grounds immediately around it are swarming with ticket scalpers, food carts, and souvenir sellers. In fact, on their approach, Eikichi and Ir have repeated opportunities to buy little portraits and toys depicting Panther himself.
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's heart leaps into his throat. He loved coming here when he and Tatsuya were working out of Nexus full-time, but now he's cagey. The orbs slide up one of his sleeves and they're gone. "Yeah."
[10:32] <03Crion> "...you want first?"
[10:32] <03Crion> "'Cause I'm fine taking first."
[10:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'll go first, we can do a carrot-and-spear thing."
[10:32] <03Crion> "Nice."
[10:32] <03Crion> "How are we playing the Sun thing?"
[10:33] <03Crion> "Trump card, or quiet?"
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Long lines lead to every visible door into the arena, so congested as to barely leave room for a child to actually slip into the structure from ground level. Must be a big event coming up. What do Ir and Eikichi want to do?
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Let's try being quiet if we can."
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Though who knows if we can..."
[10:33] <03Crion> "Will do."
[10:34] <03Crion> 4We're not here to spectate. Ir's first instinct is to ask a bouncer to see management.
[10:34] <03trenchfoot> 13Once the others have all left, Sunlit-Dreaming Ying turns back to Swan, who's hopefully still conscious. "So! How're you feeling, now that you're up?"
[10:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom, meanwhile, heads for the heart of Nexus's government bureaucracy. Well, Nexus's "government" bureaucracy. Nexus, of course, is run by the Council of Entities, a group of variously mortal and variously explicable figures who collectively set public policy. It's not immediately clear how one actually gets onto the Council or if there's any mechanism to kick them out, although 
[10:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12one supposes that'll be found in some book somewhere.
[10:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Where do business inquiries go?
[10:39] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Council's offices are in the center of the city - just a few blocks from the big arena, actually - and are a blocky white First Age building topped with a shining, mirrored dome and surrounded by auxiliary structures of very high-quality mortal make, incorporating lots of granite and marble in an attempt to blend in with the Hollow architecture they surround.
[10:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom finds that anyone is free to peruse the Incunabulum... for a modest fee, of course. One paid by the hour, although you can buy time in bulk at a slightly cheaper rate. There are helpful signs - it seems that a full week of eight-hour days is best value!
[10:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom wants a working knowledge of the current and most common civilities and, what, enough of a grasp of the Emissary's past actions that she can predict what his next steps are likely to be w/r/t blowing Panther and Swan the fuck up?
[10:44] <03dammitwho> 7Right.
[10:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "Like shit. This is - it feels like there are a dozen swords in my side. My neck and face burn. My arm-" 12He visibly calms himself. "Arianna... she's a miracle worker. But not medical miracles, usually. I don't what- I've never been this hurt. Never lost like this."
[10:47] <03Crion> 4Eh, you're projects. This crew loves projects.
[10:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Business inquiries, Eikichi knows, are usually right across the street. There's a small galaxy of enterprises that comprises the Nexus Arena, and enterprises that serve those enterprises, and so on, and so forth. The formal owners, the owners and/or agents of various fighters, the architects, the cleaners, the merchandisers, the advertisers... you don't need to travel more than a 
[10:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12block to find at least a representative of any of these concens.
[10:48] <03@Ferrinus> 12Concerns*
[10:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan, to Ying: "The... four of you. Four, right? Are there others?"
[10:52] <03Crion> 4We could walk. Or we could threaten a bouncer. The representative of those concerns is down the street, yeah -- but the concerns themselves? Probably inside, where the money's made.
[10:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Well... I'm not gonna promise anything, but we've been known to work miracles. Medical included." 13She pulls up a chair to the side of the bed. "There's five of us, actually. You've seen me, Ir, Eikichi, and Blossom, there's Tatsuya, and... we used to have Bergsveinn. Miss that guy." 13She never actually met him, but Tatsuya misses him, which is good enough for her.
[10:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "What happened?"
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The people we want are probably in the locker rooms right now. We probably want to wait and catch them on the way out."
[10:54] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Works for me."
[10:55] <03dammitwho> 7Irritating, but not surprising. Scribes aren't free.
[10:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10In the meantime, Eikichi's casually trying to figure out how someone actually gets into this business.
[10:55] <03trenchfoot> 13She turns away. "He said he had to go north."
[10:56] <03trenchfoot> "Hope he's doing okay. Not sure what he'd make of me now, actually."
[10:58] <03Crion> 4Probably the same way you get into managing a singer. Insinuate yourself into a position with someone with the juice, and then cajole or abuse them until they work for you.
[10:58] <03Crion> 4Not a great line of work.
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's not trying to hide that he's doing this from Ir, but there's some furtiveness in his movements that suggests a fear of being caught or seen.
[10:59] <03Crion> 4Ir will tolerate his bullshit, and watch the crowd.
[11:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan nods slowly. "I know how it is. It's hard to keep a Circle together... so much pulls on everyone's attention at once. So many old scores or old promises are suddenly within reach. Dace, Jade... they're both out of town, and maybe if they hadn't been this wouldn't have happened."
[11:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "You four been at this long?"
[11:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12So Eikichi and Ir are formally going to wait for the day's fighting to finish so that they can try to get hold of some example of the talent, but also, low-key, figure out how one gets into the show?
[11:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Do we have enough time to check the attack site before the fights let out?
[11:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Five," 13she corrects automatically. "Half a year, I think. Little more, maybe? I came in later, but the others... it's been a journey."
[11:09] <03trenchfoot> "How about your Circle? This must not have been the first scrape y'all ran into."
[11:12] <03Crion> 4If we do, Ir's more than amenable to hanging over. Better than hanging out at the meat market.
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Well, there's a lot of fights - it looks like they're scheduled long into the evening for today. Right now it just sounds like some poor bastards are getting mowed down by a manticore, so if Ir and Eikichi head off on some other errand it shouldn't prevent them from being back in time to hound down some actual popular gladiators.
[11:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "It's been maybe a year since we got together for the first time. I think Panther might've been Chosen for two or three by now... less for me and the others. But we've been up and down the River Province."
[11:22] <03Crion> 4Time to scope the crime scene, then.
[11:22] <03Crion> 4That's what an ex called it.
[11:22] <03Crion> 4You know, where a guy got dead.
[11:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "Fought our way in, and back out of, the Nameless Lair... dug Dace's old Daiklave up out of a tomb in this very city... guess our biggest concern has been Thorns."
[11:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10One wonders how much evidence'll be left there.
[11:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "I think a lot of the slaves that move through Nexus wind up there. Not that that's the main reason for our concern. ...most of our concern."
[11:27] <03Crion> 4What's up when they reach the place where it all went down?
[11:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12Having marked the time that the biggest-name match today will be ending, and figured out who they need to talk to if they want to enter someone into the games (or enter themselves), Ir and Eikichi move on through the city to the scene of the crime, as it were. It's not hard to remember where it was, since you got a bird's eye view on your approach, and you know you're going the right 
[11:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12direction when you start running into unusually large numbers of street cleaners, masons, painters, etc.
[11:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Actually investigating the Emissary's handiwork is a longstanding Nexus taboo, so Eikichi and Ir don't actually have to worry about too much competition when it comes to scouring the scene. They will have to worry about the effects of repair and foot traffic, though.
[11:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Seen from on foot, the area in question seems to be - to have been - a market square. Wide, joined by multiple avenues, surrounded by banks and storefronts and food shops. Lots of bustling stalls, and a wide area in the middle that's currently basically empty but which probably held more stalls or maybe platforms or a big tent or something like that.
[11:30] <03Crion> 4Time to start looking around.
[11:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12The ravages of magical combat are still visible along what's left of the cobblestones and in the various burn marks, craters, and cracks running through the facades all around the market square, of course. At a glance, it's clear that immense force and elemental power of various kinds was loosed here... followed by, obviously, a great tide of soot and gore.
[11:32] <03Crion> 4They managed to scrub that latter bit out yet?
[11:32] <03Crion> 4There's probably not gonna be a proper blood trail, but...
[11:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Does anything look scrambled like Swan was?
[11:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "We were up in Crystal, mostly. Some other things, too, but... I'll see if 'Kichi has a copy of the book to spare, if you're interested." 13She grabs her sketchbook and starts working away. "What was it about Thorns, if not the slaves?"
[11:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12Quite probably something does. Ir and Eikichi will have to look around...
[11:37] <03Crion> 4Sounds like we'll do just that.
[11:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "Everything about Thorns, really. It's ruled by a psychotic monster, and there's no indication he'll stop at one city. Every slave sent that way is at least one soldier that'll one day march against us - maybe three, if Arianna's right."
[11:46] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "The Confederation needs to act as one to, to blast the Mask from Creation's face... but as of right now, it can barely be persuaded to stop sending him fodder."
[11:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Maybe three? Does this clown know anything.
[11:48] <03Crion> 4*in minor, ominous voice* One, two, a three four five, everybody in the square so come on let's ride
[11:50] <03Crion> 4Well, it's hard to tell if the preacher lived through his meeting with the hand of...trade interdiction. Someone was left standing, Ir can tell; and people are more than willing to affirm that it wasn't just the Emissary. But then he told them to start walking, and they did. So it gets confusing after that.
[11:51] <03Crion> 4At least there's something all the merchants and passers-by are willing to agree on: clean up crew was Council's own. The privy boys. So if there's a body, either it dragged itself out, or those fuckers carried it out under tarps.
[11:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying, more lighthearted than she feels: "Oh, three is right, if that's his aim. I guess we'll be talking about that when the rest of my Circle gets back." 13'My' Circle, huh? That feels... good. "Gosh! Everything's happening all the time, there's just so much to do."
[11:54] <03dammitwho> 7It's around that time that Blossom gets back, knocking quietly on the doorframe before entering. "Everything all right in here?"
[11:55] <03Crion> 4One thing's for sure: the Guild's loud and proud angry. Good. Fuck 'em. Makes them easier to find, and easier to negotiate with.
[11:55] <03Crion> 4Everything's a negotiation, right? Even this.
[11:55] <03trenchfoot> "Hey, Blossom!" 13Ying's chipper as usual. "Swan and I were just trading stories. Talkin' about stuff around Nexus. Thorns, too."
[11:55] <03Crion> 4This bloody square.
[11:55] <03Crion> 4Negotiations will be fun.
[11:56] <03dammitwho> "Thorns? Why?"
[11:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi doesn't talk to anyone, looking like an overgrown but extremely pretty child in his pajamas, scraping his feet over cobblestones and periodically sitting on the ground as if tired while studying the blast marks.
[11:59] <03Crion> 4Ir talks to everyone. Better they're chatting with her while they're distracted by him. Oh, those pajama bottoms. If they only had a door. Get over yourselves, women. And men.
[12:00] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "They're a big buyer in slaves, apparently. Might be makin' themselves an army? Swan's Circle's been workin' that beat, 'til. You know." 
[12:00] <03Crion> 4Otherwise, she'll be mainly circumspect but curious, like she's trying to find a business angle.
[12:00] <03Crion> 4These shitheads will eat that up.
[12:03] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That's low, even for the Guild."
[12:04] <03Crion> 4By the time they're done, Ir's convinced the next stage of things is as follows: they've got to come up with a venture, and express an interest in working with the Guild.
[12:04] <03Crion> 4And through the Guild, then, they've got to access the Council.
[12:04] <03Crion> 4And maybe that venture's about bodies. Using their connect in Sijan.
[12:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan nods. "That's what I thought. Then I came around. I think it's business as usual for the Guild."
[12:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Swan: "I'm not sure if they think they can curry favor with the Mask or just... can't think ahead, institutionally. But it's perfectly normal for them."
[12:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi gets a couple people tossing him coins as he sits at the side of the square, and he has to wave off one or two people offering to shelter him, but a while later he pops up and walks over to Ir like he'd been sitting around waiting for her. "Alright, ready to go?"
[12:14] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Been ready. You?"
[12:14] <03Crion> "Got enough addresses?"
[12:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "People here are really nice!" 10He's got a smile plastered onto his face like he saw someone throw up and is trying not to make them feel weird about it.
[12:16] <03Crion> 4Idiot.
[12:16] <03Crion> 4She gives him the run down on what she's learned, and her plan for it. "So I'm thinking we get disruptive."
[12:16] <03Crion> "Specifically, we disrupt the body industry."
[12:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Good."
[12:17] <03Crion> "First, we figure out if anyone else is in that niche. We undercut them, fuck them up, push them out. Then we get Tatsuya doing his Wicked impersonation as our front man."
[12:18] <03Crion> "You're trying to sell these clowns on dead people, pretty dead boy is the best sales pitch."
[12:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "...sure."
[12:18] <03Crion> "Then we present ourselves to the Council as contractors. Get rid of the bodies, no ghosts guaranteed, no shadowlands, nothing the Emissary needs to deal with."
[12:19] <03Crion> "And that gives us our in, to either find Panther's body, or maybe the rest of him."
[12:19] <03Crion> "But probably the body."
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It might not be a body, exactly."
[12:20] <03Crion> 4Ir sighs. "Anyway I hate myself now, but this is how the Guild in Pneuma would think. Seems like it'd work doubly well here."
[12:20] <03Crion> "Explain?"
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Blowing the square up wasn't what the Emissary intended to do. He was trying to do something subtler or more complicated and it either failed or he gave up and did this instead."
[12:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "How's that relate to bodies?"
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The cart that rolled out had something much heavier than a body in it. Even Panther's body."
[12:21] <03Crion> "Aha."
[12:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So we have Tatsuya play up the special considerations pitch. If the Emissary fucked up, then they're worried about knock-on effects, right?"
[12:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I guess..."
[12:23] <03Crion> "Like if he, I don't know, turned him into a big ol' steel slab or something."
[12:23] <03Crion> "We know how to deal with that."
[12:23] <03Crion> "Gets us in the door."
[12:24] <03Crion> "I mean if you're not comfortable with it we could do something else. But this gives us the out of claiming people trying to stop us are obstructing trade."
[12:24] <03Crion> "And that seems pretty strong."
[12:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Eikichi and Ir plot and scheme while waiting to meet their heroes, all the while Blossom and Ying get to know Swan better and so learn about the River Province's outstanding political and supernatural concerns. We'll see where it goes... next week.
[12:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I don't think we should put the slave of a Deathlord forward as our face. We're almost as close to Thorns as we are to Sijan."
[12:25] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Then I'll do it, or you will."

[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi, distracted: "That makes sense." 10He stops at a market stall, a florist. After a little back-and-forth he comes away with two bouquets of flowers, one of wild roses and one of something delicate that hasn't opened yet. "So we're in the body business, huh?"
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "My parents would be proud."
[12:30] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Mine would hate me for it."

[12:30] <03Crion> "Nice flowers."
[12:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah. Do you want a rose?"
[12:31] <03Crion> "Not from you." 4That comes out harsher than perhaps she means. "That's got associations where I come from."
[12:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Suit yourself."
[12:32] <03Crion> "I have."
[12:32] <03Crion> 4She does buy a rose for herself.
[12:32] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Anyway. Figure out a new name. We don't need Eikichi Sho in the corpsing business until you're writing it up."
[12:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Am I going to be in disguise?"
[12:33] <03Crion> 4Ir: "If not disguise, then dress-up that suits you. I'm sure Tatsuya or Ying can square you away. Me too, if you want me along as a bodyguard or what not."
[12:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Yeeeess
[12:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Alright, I guess I have to come up with another character then."
[12:35] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm gonna assert veto power over whatever you give me. Not that I don't trust you, but, too many dudes have asked me to dress up as a harem girl for shows for me to trust you."
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No hard feelings."
[12:36] <03Crion> "Not unless your slacks are cut for them."
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wow."
[12:36] <03Crion> "Yep."
[12:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "We're going to have to set up double lives at another address, too. Preferably with sewer access -- does Nexus have sewer access? I just assumed it did, because of you Velvet boys."
[12:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi stops walking abruptly. "The Undercity's its own thing."
[12:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Okay. Can I catch up with you back at the Scarlet Palace? I need to do a couple things."
[12:39] <03Crion> 4Ir: "So long as we can move through it. Yeah, I've gotta go leer at bodybuilders for a bit. Establish my whole deal."
[12:40] <03Crion> "Say hi to Blossom for me."
[12:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Okay."
[12:42] <03Crion> 4Ir wanders off into the crowd, not really caring about the scene, moonsilver jewelry glittering. Make 'em look one way...
[12:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's going to do a little shopping. First he's going to buy a hat, then he's going to get a haircut, then he's going to go register someone at the Arena.
[12:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Or, in the entry level arena league, anyway.
[12:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Looks like most of that work will have to happen tomorrow, though. They need the combatant in person.
[12:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anyway, where's Blossom when Eikichi gets back at the hotel a little while before dusk?
[12:48] <03dammitwho> 7Still in Swan's room. Both he and Sunlit-Dreaming Ying are snoozing from exhaustion, and she's quietly writing in her notebook.
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi pops his head in the door and whispers "Hey!"
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Hey!"
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> \
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> http://i.imgur.com/xw2vdGl.jpg
[12:50] <03dammitwho> 7She looks up. "You cut your hair!"
[12:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, I didn't, but- yeah." 10He comes fully into the room, holding a bouquet of flowers. "How was your day?"
[12:52] <03dammitwho> 7What kind of flowers are they.
[12:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Incense lilies. They haven't opened for the evening yet.
[12:54] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom stands and quietly slips out into the common room with Eikichi - presumably - following, before she says: "Oh, incense lilies! Did I ever tell you that these are my favorite?"
[12:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You did! I was wondering if I could find them this far east this time of year and here they are, like they were picked fresh from the slopes of the Mountain."
[12:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So I thought you'd like some." 10He holds them out for her.
[12:59] <03dammitwho> 7She smiles and clutches the bouquet. "I didn't do much work today, only the studying the Incunabula."
[13:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Studying is work! You can tell because I avoid it whenever possible."
[13:05] <03dammitwho> 7She snorts. "Anyway, I think we're going to be okay with regards to the Emissary or the Council hunting down Swan, but we should still deliver him to wherever Arianna is hiding soon."
[13:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah. Ir had an interesting idea for how to find Panther, since we think we know where he is, or where what's left of him is."
[13:07] <03dammitwho> "What?"
[13:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We'd bid on corpse disposal contracts and undercut everyone else."
[13:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's not something we'd want to put our own names on, but Ying can help us with that."
[13:09] <03dammitwho> 7She sighs. "You're going to make us wear themed disguises."
[13:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm not, but do you remember how disappointed Ying was when we had to break character in the Hedgehog?"
[13:11] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom winces at the memory. "It's inevitable, then. At least we'll be making some decent money, minus cart rental and sundries."
[13:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You can pick your own costume, as long as it's all black and mysterious and spooky. I'm probably going to look like Magistrate Billowing-Cape's-Rose."
[13:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I bought a hat and everything."
[13:13] <03dammitwho> "I'll have to let Ying do it. I am not 'spooky'."
[13:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Spooky just means you're intimidating and wearing too much eyeliner."
[13:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So you're not naturally spooky, but I bet you could make it work."
[13:16] <03dammitwho> 7She scowls. Eikichi can tell there's something deeper about this bothering her.
[13:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi sits down by whatever vase Blossom puts the lilies in. There's a bundle of roses on the bed. "What's on your mind?"
[13:19] <03dammitwho> "I don't- I don't want to dress like Still Orchid."
[13:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Still Orchid?"
[13:19] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "She was one of my best friends when we were young. She's Mnemon Caras now."
[13:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And she was... spooky?"
[13:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Yeah... quiet, liked knives, dressed in dark clothes, always wore a scowl. She acted like the whole world bored her, unless you knew her."
[13:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi shifts, suddenly uncomfortable.
[13:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "When did you last hear from her?"
[13:25] <03dammitwho> "She's dead to me."
[13:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Ooh, what happened?"
[13:32] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Just like Joyous Spring and all my other friends. She exalted, I didn't. She turned on me."
[13:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Turned on you? Do you mean she blew you off or did she actually go out of her way to make you feel worse about it?"
[13:35] <03dammitwho> 7She gives him a look that's equal parts baffled and annoyed. "What do you think?" 7Then she softens. "I guess it's different for the patricians."
[13:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I honestly don't know. Sorry."
[13:39] <03dammitwho> "We're soldiers, generals, and statesmen. Nobody's allowed to fall behind."
[13:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What did they do?"
[13:44] <03dammitwho> "Made it clear that I wasn't good enough to lead them anymore. To me and anyone who would listen. A litany of failure and mockeries."
[13:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's barbaric."
[13:48] <03dammitwho> 7She shrugs uncomfortably. "Like I said, they're dead to me now."
[13:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, okay."
[13:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But if you ever need help exactly a horrible vengeance, I insist you let me know."
[13:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> *exacting
[13:51] <03dammitwho> "I'd settle for never seeing them again."
[13:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Okay."
[13:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If it helps, my friends and family will all love you."
[13:52] <03trenchfoot> 6Will, 13nothing.
[13:54] <03Crion_> 4If it helps, my friends are dead and my family has disowned me.
[13:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We're not dead.
[13:55] <03trenchfoot> 13It's 6true!
[13:55] <03Crion_> 4True.
[13:55] <03Crion_> 4Well, not yet at least. Let Ying work.
[14:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10By now, the sun's all but set, and the lilies in their vase open and bloom. It happens over a couple of minutes, and as they do they release their sweet pollen into.
[14:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10into the air.
[14:05] <03dammitwho> 7Silently, Excessively Righteous Blossom places the vase on the windowsill, so the dusty pollen can rise in its signature column into the skies.
[14:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks at the blossoms, and then at Blossom.
[14:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10...no. The moment's not right. He thought the flowers would help but then he went and screwed it up. Oh well. Another time.

[09:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 
[10:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I liked your sketches." 10Eikichi sounds kind of drowsy. It's been a long day, whatever day this is. "What are they for?"
[10:03] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, startled: "Which sketches?"
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "From your notebook. With the essence diagrams?"
[10:08] <03dammitwho> "Oh." 7She's sitting in one of the more elaborate Nexus chairs that's shaped like a lopsided cup, so she's able to lean back into the cushions. "It's not for anything, yet. It doesn't work. I'm trying to sketch out the essence flows for the central structure on the estate we're going to have."
[10:09] <03dammitwho> "Getting aesthetics, function, and spiritual nature to work together in harmony is frustrating."
[10:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's stretched out over the entire length of a puffy red-and-gold sofa that he had demons carry in from another suite, where it matched the decor. "It's magic, is what it is."
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Our estate? For the circle?"
[10:15] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Right. There's not enough room for things on the Heavensward."
[10:15] <03dammitwho> "Most of Creation isn't owned by anybody in any serious sort of way, so..."
[10:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We'll still need money though, surely?"
[10:25] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Not as much as you'd think. Wood actually does grow on trees, elementals can find good stone and metal, and as far as food goes... we can summon up something to till the soil for us, or I'm sure we can find some destitute Reach peasants who'd be delighted to work fields where they're protected and their lands blessed."
[10:25] <03dammitwho> "Money's not hard to get, anyway. Just make something and sell it to people."
[10:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Do you have any locations picked out?"
[10:29] <03dammitwho> "No. Somewhere in the East, over a small river?"
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Mmmmm... we could look for a demesne."
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We could make one, too."
[10:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That would be useful." 7After a moment, she passes the battered notebook over to Eikichi. "Have a look."
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi sits up and takes the notebook. 
[10:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10After a moment: "Is this a laboratory?"
[10:45] <03dammitwho> "Not yet. I need to learn about alchemistry equipment. So far all it does is ruin the feng shui." 7She says irritably.
[10:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods. "You should consult with a geomancer, or an alchemist. Obviously someone who knew both disciplines would be better... especially if they also had some grasp of architecture..."
[10:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He sighs. "Imagine light coming in through the glass, catching water as it flows down all these pools, inflecting the essence every step of the way..."
[10:55] <03dammitwho> 7She snorts. "Look. You see?" 7She points to a set of tentative formulae scrawled in the margin. "The fertility essence is important. I've heard of herbalists growing entire plants from a leaf or stem cutting of an old one, so why not with animals or people? Or parts of people, anyway." 7She gestures with her chin at Swan, still sleeping. "Like an arm, or a few innards."
[10:55] <03dammitwho> "Grow replacements from a drop of blood."
[10:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Huh."
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'd never thought of it that way. There must be some way... and this is exactly what we need some place of our own for."
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Part of it, anyway."
[11:02] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Right!"
[11:03] <03dammitwho> "See, I've got two full essence cycles going. One horizontal, in a circle with the main tower at its center, and one vertical throughout the tower. Earth/Fire at the bottom, Water/Wood above that, and Air at the top."
[11:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A tower!"
[11:07] <03dammitwho> "Yeah, I thought it should look a bit like the Imperial Manse..." 7Her drawings are indeed of an imposing pagoda.
[11:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "When we're not busy, we could sit in the pagoda and pose challenges to journeying heroes."
[11:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What kind of elemental should we make them fight to prove themselves?"
[11:14] <03dammitwho> "Stone golem."
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's still looking at the layout of the estate when "Where's the school?"
[11:21] <03dammitwho> "The what?"
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You said we'd have people, working and living on the land, and even if you hadn't planned for it we certainly will. We're going to need a school."
[11:29] <03dammitwho> "I see. Yes, all right. Perhaps a broad, one story building like the Gymnasium?"
[11:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That would be nice. Is something wrong?"
[11:33] <03dammitwho> "Hmm? No, you're right. I'm annoyed that I hadn't considered it."
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi makes a face.
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Wait. Hang on."
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You visited the Gymnasium?"
[11:36] <03dammitwho> "Yes."
[11:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You should've told me! I would've come, I haven't visited since we got here."
[11:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Don't worry, I left behind one of your books for them."
[11:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Really?"
[11:44] <03dammitwho> "Yes! They hadn't heard of us."
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Ha!"
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...I wonder how much longer that will be true."
[11:45] <03dammitwho> "They have heard of us now," 7Blossom explains patiently. "I said I left the book."
[11:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You know what I mean. How much longer will we be able to walk around Nexus without getting recognized?"
[11:47] <03dammitwho> "Ir's going to be joining the Arena." 7She points out. "Her face will be on walls throughout the city."
[11:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi makes a big show of settling back down on the sofa. "Oh really?"
[11:50] <03dammitwho> "They know how to advertise."
[11:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah... what do you think it'll be for you?"
[11:54] <03dammitwho> "Who knows? We didn't seek fame in Crystal, we did what we thought was right and the fame took care of itself. As it should be."
[11:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "There was that time I made a huge glass sculpture for no real reason."
[11:58] <03dammitwho> "It was a thoughtful gesture for the people of Crystal. They had very little public art."
[11:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Maybe you're right."
[11:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You know what I think?"
[12:00] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom puts her chin in her hands. "Tell me."
[12:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I think you should preach."
[12:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "If not in Nexus, then certainly when we're out in the provinces. But you should preach in Nexus."
[12:03] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "You know what?"
[12:04] <03dammitwho> "You're right. I should."
[12:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yes! I'm so glad to hear you say that. It means I can start asking you for help with my next book."
[12:05] <03dammitwho> "What's that?"
[12:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's something I've been working on as a sort of all-ages ethical treatise. I've been working on how to fold art into the writing. But my idea is a series of short stories where someone comes to you for help or tries to get one over on you, and you teach them a lesson."
[12:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm calling it The Thousand Correct Actions of Excessively Righteous Blossom."
[12:11] <03dammitwho> "A good try, Eikichi, but it is impossible to fool me."
[12:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Blossom."
[12:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> "When have I ever tried to fool you?"
[12:13] <03dammitwho> "Never. The wisdom of the Sun told you that you would fail."
[12:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "So... do you want to see what I have so far or not?"
[12:17] <03dammitwho> "Yes. Absolutely. Immediately. What do you have?"
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you want to see a simple story, a true story, or a grand story?"
[12:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Tell me all the stories in turn."
[12:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi smiles. He knew she was going to say that. "Fiiiiiiiiiiine. I'll get my notes."
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He sits up, stretches, and reaches under the sofa cushion where he's got a stack of papers stashed. "See, that's why you didn't know about it."
[12:36] <03dammitwho> "Because you were sitting on them?"
[12:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Because I hid them, cleverly, away from all the other notes you snoop through."
[12:39] <03dammitwho> "I don't snoop."
[12:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What do you call it, then?"
[12:43] <03dammitwho> "Keeping up with the interests of my friends and sworn brothers."
[12:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, I suppose I've kept this under wraps for too long. I'm interested in you."
[12:46] <03dammitwho> "As you should be." 7She gestures imperiously. "Continue."
[12:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi clears his throat. "This one's called Blossom the Peacemaker."
[12:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> Two kingdoms in the River Province were on the verge of war for the possession of an embankment. And Excessively Righteous Blossom, seeing the kings and their armies ready to fight, asked to hear the cause of their quarrels.
[12:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> Having heard both sides, she said: "I understand that the embankment has value for some of your people; has it any inherent value aside from its usefulness?"
[12:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> The kings were confused by this. "None," was the eventual reply.
[12:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> Blossom continued: "When you go to battle, isn't it certain that many of your soldiers will be slain and that you yourselves, kings, are liable to die as well?"
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> They said: "It is sure that many will be slain and our own lives endangered."
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Your blood, then, and theirs," said Blossom, "has it less inherent value than a mound of earth?"
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "No," the kings said, "The lives of people and above all the lives of kings, are priceless."
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> Blossom concluded: "So you stake something priceless against that which has no inherent value at all?"
[12:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> The wrath of the two monarchs subsided, and they came to a peaceable agreement.
[12:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi looks up. What's Blossom's reaction?
[12:52] <03dammitwho> 7She looks thoughtful. "This makes me sound like a pacifist."
[12:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You think?"
[12:54] <03dammitwho> "A bit. I like the peacemaking in general..."
[12:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I was trying to make you sound practical. You wouldn't fight for a petty reason."
[12:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The moral's supposed to be, have some perspective."
[12:59] <03dammitwho> "Maybe make it clear that the embankment doesn't actually have any practical use, and the kings are fighting for point-scoring reasons? One of the endless squabbles of the Hundred Kingdoms, that kind of thing?" 7She offers.
[13:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Hmmm."
[13:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Yeah, that makes sense." 10He doesn't have a pen so he just makes a mental note to change it later. "Anyway, that's roughly the idea."
[13:05] <03dammitwho> 7She nods. "Good."
[13:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I'm still trying to decide on the art style..."
[13:15] <03dammitwho> "Traditional?"
[13:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Traditional is so boring though..."
[13:18] <03dammitwho> "Well, what kind do you want?"
[13:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you remember my doodles?"
[13:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi holds a piece of paper out to Blossom. "I've been messing around with those a lot."
[13:22] <03dammitwho> 7What's he got there? Blossom examines it.
[13:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> http://i.imgur.com/qfKnynu.png
[13:23] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Oh, that's cute! It even has my armor!"
[13:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah!"
[13:30] <03dammitwho> "Okay, what's next?"
[13:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi, pretending he's forgotten: "Next what?"
[13:32] <03dammitwho> "You said a simple story, a true story, or a grand story. You've only told one so far."
[13:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Which one do you want to hear next?"
[13:33] <03dammitwho> "The true story."
[13:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Okay."
[13:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This one is called Blossom and the Sorcerer."
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> Excessively Righteous Blossom met several demons while on a long voyage. And though the demons were strange and frightening, she loved them all the same, and saw they were badly mistreated by their master. So she sought out their master, a powerful sorcerer with an indolent heart.
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> She asked: "Why do you treat your demons so poorly? They are graceful and well-mannered, and bring no one any harm."
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> The sorcerer would have ignored her, but they were entranced by her beauty and the shock of the question.
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> The sorcerer replied: "Because I have bound them, and have dominion over them. They are my inferiors and respect is wasted on them."
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> Blossom said: "What of a peasant farmer? She is less powerful than you are. Should you treat her so badly as well?"
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "No," the sorcerer said, "for a peasant is still human, and all men and women are my brothers and sisters."
[13:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But you have dominion over them," said Blossom, for she was insistent. "They are your inferiors just as the demons are."
[13:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> The sorcerer was angry. "No!" they said. "I am no better than the barest or weakest among us."
[13:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> Then Blossom said: "Do you not live as a laughing prince among them? Do you not bask in their regard?"
[13:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> The sorcerer replied that this was so. "But I should not look at them as inferiors!"
[13:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> Blossom pinched the sorcerer's face. "Fool! Hypocrite that you are, for the truth is plain and you ignore it!"
[13:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> With a stinging cheek, the sorcerer acknowledged her wisdom. "Forgive me!"
[13:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It is not my forgiveness you need," said Blossom. "Seek the forgiveness of those you wronged and neglected from your cruelty."
[13:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> The sorcerer did, and strove ever after to walk the path of the virtuous lord.
[13:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom claps. "Good! Good!"
[13:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I thought you'd like that one."
[13:57] <03dammitwho> "I notice you've declined to give the sorcerer's name or gender. Modesty?"
[13:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi hesitates, but only briefly. "I have to assume that at some point you'll teach a lesson to some other wastrel of a sorcerer, and I want to keep my options open."
[14:01] <03dammitwho> 7She hmms, amused. "Now, the grand story!"
[14:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The grand story's not finished, and it's... different from the other ones. I think it might be better off as its own thing, or just, I don't know. Forgotten."
[14:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Do you want to hear what I have so far?"
[14:07] <03dammitwho> "Ooh, now I have to hear it."
[14:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "This is called Excessively Righteous Blossom and the Three Masters (And The Lessons She Never Learned From Them)."
[14:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> https://pastebin.com/Zt2LN9jp
[14:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Or at least, it will be," 10he says before he begins reading. It's quite long, much longer than the others.
[14:17] <03dammitwho> "A small, evil thing? A nasty red coal?"
[14:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "The tone of the narration is contemptuous of this version of you. It's meant to be from the perspective of someone who wants to see you fail."
[14:19] <03dammitwho> "Still..."
[14:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Imagine, though."
[14:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Imagine if you were petty and ugly and hateful and selfish, and the Sun still loved you best. Imagine if you still had it in you to achieve enlightenment."
[14:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Imagine..." 10he looks down at his writing. "Imagine a love that doesn't overlook our flaws but holds them up and renders them shining."
[14:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, quietly: "Are you sure this is about me?"
[14:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "What do you mean?"
[14:24] <03dammitwho> "You're a little hard on yourself, sometimes."
[14:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi giggles.
[14:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You think I'm too hard on myself?"
[14:30] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, indignant: "You are!"
[14:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You are."
[14:33] <03dammitwho> "No, you are."
[14:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You forgot a building on your first draft for our new home which you're designing from scratch by yourself and you seized up like you'd just knocked a glass elephant over."
[14:46] <03dammitwho> "Of course they're going to need a school, I can't believe I- no, you won't turn it back on me!" 7She taps the paper Eikichi's holding with a finger. "Two of these are stories about you not measuring up, so: No, you are."
[14:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's not true."
[14:47] <03dammitwho> "It's extremely true."
[14:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "One of these stories is about you teaching me to be a better person. That's not 'not measuring up'. That's just being alive! You do dumb things and you learn from them. If you're really lucky, people you love can help you do it."
[14:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "And the other story is about the part of us that does that, which everybody has."
[14:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's human to feel jealous or angry or mean. It's human to be petty or selfish."
[14:54] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "You're not petty or selfish, you're so caring that it bothers you to consider the least peasant farmer or drunkard in the street as your inferior, even if it's true. And not because you're afraid of the responsibility for them! You shouldered that first!"
[14:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi makes a frustrated noise.
[14:55] <03dammitwho> "Y-" 7Her eyes narrow and she points an accusing finger at Eikichi. "You, are putting yourself down in order to trick me into talking about how great you are. Fiend! Trickster!"
[14:56] <03dammitwho> "Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--" 7She launches herself across the room towards where Eikichi is reclining on the sofa!
[14:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm not putting myself down! It's not- ?!!!"
[14:59] <03dammitwho> 7It's close-- They're both quick and Eikichi is cunning, but Blossom is stronger, and soon she he has him pulled off the couch and pinned to the floor by the shoulders. She gazes down at him, hair framing her face. "Ha. Victory."
[15:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I- you-"
[15:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Then Eikichi's looking up at her. "You..."
[15:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> "...win."
[15:01] <03dammitwho> "Don't sputter." 7She leans in to kiss him. "It was inevitable."

[22:24] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WrruFyhtVw
[22:28] <03Quaker> Frances and KJ probably didn’t notice when Tommy kind of slumped over and stopped moving. He’s not the talkative type, after all - what’s one more night of not speaking up?
[22:28] <03Quaker> They probably noticed when his chair started to scoot across the floor with an awful metallic scraping noise, though, since everyone started to look. So KJ might have seen the glazed over look in his eyes. 
[22:29] <03Quaker> They definitely noticed when his chair suddenly flung itself sideways, and he sprawled on the floor…next to Cav and Wilson?
[22:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Hooboy.
01[22:30] <03banana> 6What, what are THOSE guys doing at the auction?
[22:31] <03Crion|> 4Yo.
[22:31] <03VoxPVoxD> 10That's a, uh. Where are we, exactly? What's going on?
[22:31] <03Quaker> Some chairs go skidding out of the way when they crash onto the floor. A soft red spotlight descends on them from the ceiling. The Auctioneer taps his throat, and quickly mentions that sales will resume in a moment, please bear with us as we sort things out. 
[22:33] <03tom> 14Tommy Saldana wakes up on his back.
[22:33] <03Quaker> Cav finds himself looking up into a familiar face. 
[22:33] <03Crion|> 4Yeah?
[22:33] <03Crion|> 4Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhh.
[22:33] <03Quaker> Trubee gently prods Tommy with her foot to see if he moves. “Hm.” 
[22:34] <03Crion|> 4Well, this is awkward.
[22:34] <03tom> "Guh."
[22:34] <03Crion|> "Hey there, kid."
[22:34] <03Quaker> Then, she motions at Frances and KJ to come over. 
01[22:34] <03banana> 6Well, it's not the face of KJ Valentine. She's invisible, because some shit is going down, and you want to start shit on your OWN terms.
[22:34] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson groans, mainly for effect, as he stands.
[22:34] <03tom> "What the fuck," 14the nosferatu mumbles.
01[22:34] <03banana> 6She'll still follow the gesture, whether it was directed at Frances or whether this.. girl? can see her..
[22:34] <03VoxPVoxD> "You should see the other guys."
[22:35] <03Quaker> Frances: “Should we go-“. She realizes KJ has vanished. “KJ?” Frances walks over to the little crowd. 
[22:35] <03tom> "I think someone spiked the punch."
[22:36] <03Crion|> 4To Wilson: "Ha. That's funny. You should see the other guys."
[22:36] <03Crion|> "Anyone ever tell you you should go into TV?"
[22:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts.
[22:37] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Don’t call me that. You should come with me. You look like you could use someplace to recover.” She glances around at the annoyed faces of the other patrons. “Like, now. All of you. Including whoever’s cloaked themselves that I’m not remembering to address.” 
[22:37] <03tom> 14Tommy Saldana knows when he's been beaten, and so does not attempt to get off the floor.
01[22:37] <03banana> 6Just outside of the spotlight, KJ is trying to read this woman's aura as fast as possible. 
[22:37] <03tom> "What the fuck," 14he repeats, "just happened."
[22:38] <03Crion|> 4Yeah, that sounds good to Cav. "Lead the way."
[22:38] <03Crion|> 4To Tommy: "You ever see a show called the Magic School Bus?"
[22:39] <03tom> "Yeah?" 14The Nosferatu sits up, rubbing his temples. 
[22:39] <03Crion|> "Real popular when I was a kid on public television. Sort of like an educational thing. Conceit was instead of using textbooks, the teacher was a wizard and her school bus would take them into outer space or inside a volcano or whatever."
[22:40] <03Crion|> "Anyway, there's one episode where they get really, really small, and go inside the human body."
[22:40] <03Crion|> "And long story short, it's alien and disgusting and they all want to get out as soon as possible."
[22:40] <03Crion|> "Wilson and I just did that, but with my soul."
[22:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Are we out of the big room now or are we having this conversation in front of all the weirdos?
[22:41] <03Quaker> KJ can see the woman’s aura pretty easily. In the excitement, she hasn’t bothered to do much to hide it. Valentine can see swirling patterns of red and brown shift slowly into a light blue…all the colors are emphasized by bursting and tiny constellations of sparkles. 
[22:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10All the not-us weirdos.
[22:41] <03tom> "So what the fuck happened to me?"
[22:41] <03Crion|> 4Cav won't start in on the PBS explainers until they're clear and it's just them and Trubee.
[22:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10I knew I should've stayed home today.
[22:42] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Well the good news is, you weren't with us. But that leaves a whole lot of other places you could have been."
[22:42] <03tom> 14For his part, Tommy crawls over to something steady enough to support his weight before trying to prop himself up.
01[22:42] <03banana> 6That's not how auras work. What the hell kind of emotion is 'starbursts and swirling'?
[22:42] <03Quaker> In front of all the weirdos. “Hang on,” says Trubee, bending over the new arrivals. She fastens plastic wristbands, the kind you see at carnivals and music shows, to their wrists, and the red spotlight goes away. Then, after having pulled Tommy to his feet, she leads them over to the side of the room, in front of a door that reads EMPLOYEES ONLY. 
[22:43] <03tom> "Thanks," 14 is about all the nosferatu can muster.
[22:43] <03Quaker> There’s a caged light next to it, glowing red. She takes out a key and puts it into the door’s lock, turning it. The light goes green, and then she pulls it open and motions for them to go through. 
[22:44] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Hopefully she actually works here and didn't lift that key off somebody.
01[22:44] <03banana> 6Ultimately, in the Brilliant Court you learn to kind of go with it. KJ's not going to bother remaining hidden since Frances and the others are clearly being.. collected.. for some purpose that likely includes her anyway. There's too many of them to actually be in danger, except from their own Beasts snarling.
[22:45] <03VoxPVoxD> 10How many of us even have audible Beasts? Like, two? One of whom is Ma's kid?
01[22:46] <03banana> 6KJ, appearing as she passes through the doorway: "This should be more surprising."
[22:46] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Watch your step.” 
[22:47] <03Quaker> They should, too, since it’s a very short flight of metal stairs from the door leading down to asphalt, and a…parking lot. 
[22:48] <03tom> 14Tommy stumbles down the steps after Trubee, pausing for a moment to collect himself before continuing: "So uh, what.. what the fuck was that?"
[22:48] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Magic."
[22:48] <03Crion|> 4To Trubee: "It was some kinda magic, wasn't it?"
01[22:48] <03banana> "She's no Kindred."
01[22:49] <03banana> "..of ours, anyway."
[22:49] <03tom> "Okay, yeah, but is it bad form to come back into a party after everyone's seen you passed out in a closet?"
[22:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Depends on the party."
[22:49] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Huh? How should I know?” She waits until the last of them have passed through the door, and then closes it behind her. 
[22:50] <03Crion|> 4Cav rolls his eyes.
01[22:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "Have we participated in some sort of spiritual rescue? What were we, homing beacons? What are you?"
[22:51] <03Quaker> The little party is standing in an empty parking lot, lit only by a distant set of streetlights running down its center. A good half-mile off, they can see the beach and ocean. It’s very quiet out here. The only sound is crickets and waves. 
[22:53] <03Quaker> They’ve just come out of what looks like an enormous and run-down RV. On the back, items like folded card tables and bone white plastic patio chairs are held in a big rope net. Someone’s nailed an amateurish painting of the beach at sunset next to it. 
[22:53] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson looks back at the RV.
[22:53] <03VoxPVoxD> "So, uh..."
[22:53] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I guess my main concern is figuring out just how far out the ripples from what just happened in there are gonna go."
[22:54] <03Crion|> "Unfortunately, I've got no fucking clue what that is."
[22:54] <03Crion|> "And my guy who knew those sorts of things skipped town a few months back."
[22:54] <03Crion|> "So I'm flying blind."
01[22:54] <03banana> 6You know what would be a good accompaniment to crickets? Answers!
[22:55] <03VoxPVoxD> 10How's the mortal girl holding up? She seem stressed? In over her head?
[22:55] <03tom> 14Tommy stares back at the RV: "You know what? I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of being weirded out by this."
[22:56] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Hold on.” She puts her key back in the door, and - another caged light is out here, and it turns from red to green again when the key is inserted - grabs hold of a lever next to it. She pulls, and a little icon next to the keyhole spins, going from a bag of money with a dollar sign on it to a picture of two swords crossed. She pulls again, and the icon changes from swords to a stylized hamburger. She pulls another 
[22:56] <03Quaker> lever next to the first. 
[22:56] <03VoxPVoxD> 10That's pretty good.
01[22:57] <03banana> 6KJ: "'Howl's Moving Castle'."
[22:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ha."
01[22:58] <03banana> 6A brief smile. "Okay, does anyone know who she is?"
[22:58] <03tom> 14Tommy, bent over, clutching his stomach: "No."
[22:59] <03Quaker> The panels of the RV closer to the driver’s window start to spin like a slot machine, whirling and blinking until they slow and settle on a glass screen plastered with pictures of food and menus. WE TAKE DEBIT is pinned up next to the window for the cash register. Immediately, they can smell onions cooking on a grill. Trubee takes the key back out and puts it in her pocket. “Okay. Sorry. Chairs are back here if you want to 
[22:59] <03Quaker> sit down.” She points at the chairs and tables in the rope net. 
[22:59] <03Crion|> 4To KJ: "Yeah. Yeah, we've met."
[22:59] <03Crion|> "Played pool against her once."
[23:00] <03Crion|> "She's human, but she's not mortal. Or she's mortal, but she's not human."
[23:00] <03Crion|> 4He shrugs. "She's a wizard or something."
[23:00] <03tom> 14Finger guns. "Into it."
01[23:00] <03banana> 6KJ sits on a table. "You know some really weird people, Cavanaugh. Like, you realise this is why half the city is having you watched, right?"
[23:01] <03Quaker> The mortal seems fine. She sits down in a patio chair. “So…feel free to chill out here for a while. I can’t let you back in to the auction tonight. But you’re not banned or anything.” 
[23:01] <03tom> "Why," 14croaks Tommy as he collapses into the plastic chair across from Trubee.
[23:01] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I could do without people telling me how great my social life is right now. No offense to present company."
[23:01] <03tom> "I mean, it's like.."
[23:01] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Speaking of which. Been awhile, Trubee."
[23:01] <03Crion|> "You, ah, been in touch with Rollie at all?"
[23:02] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Hello.” She doesn’t seem especially happy to see him. But she doesn’t seem unhappy, either. 
[23:02] <03tom> "What grim shit just happened to me? Am I having visions or am I being hazed on night one of the monster mash auction party?"
[23:02] <03Quaker> “Oh. Um….not really. Just letting each other know we’re okay, occasionally.” 
[23:03] <03Crion|> 4Cav's smile is polite but forced. "Glad to hear it."
[23:03] <03Crion|> "So that auction in there, was that one of ours or one of yours?"
01[23:04] <03banana> 6To Frances: "I hope there wasn't something you really wanted to buy."
[23:04] <03tom> "I didn't even get to see what was for sale."
[23:04] <03Quaker> Trubee looks at Tommy: “What? We don’t haze customers.” She looks back at the window where aromatic smells are coming out. “There’s food if you guys want it. I, uh…well, they just have tacos and stuff. No blood.” 
[23:05] <03Quaker> Frances is startled out of thought. “Oh, no!” she replies, excited. “This is much more interesting.” She grasps Tommy’s arm. “Did you see something?” 
01[23:06] <03banana> 6KJ: "I prefer avec-sang, but thanks."
[23:07] <03Quaker> Trubee: “It’s just a job. I’m pretty sure my boss has all his paperwork in order. But they’re not, um…they’re not wizards. I am, though, yeah. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We get all kinds, though. You saw.” 
01[23:07] <03banana> 6If this is the degree of answers the wizard(?) is going to share, she's getting a phone out to look up where they even are on GPS.
[23:08] <03Quaker> They’re on a beach between San Clemente and Dana Point. 
[23:08] <03tom> 14Tommy looks down at his arm and very gently attempts to tug himself free without allowing any of his skin to slough off in the woman's grip. "I mean, look, that's pretty personal."
[23:08] <03Quaker> Trubee: “So…why did you suddenly appear in a private auction? It’s warded against teleportation pretty well.” 
[23:09] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson sits down with a tray of tacos. He hasn't eaten solid food in a while, and not sober since he died. "Tommy let us in. Would be my guess."
[23:09] <03Quaker> Frances lets him go but stays close. “But…you did see something, didn’t you? Like in- oh! Your hands…they’re bleeding…” She motions at his wounds. 
[23:10] <03tom> "Holy fucking shit."
[23:10] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Does Tommy have stigmata?
01[23:10] <03banana> 6Could be worse. WHAT is happening to Saldana though? Has he caught this same weirdness-magnet issue?
[23:10] <03Crion|> 4Cav just stares at Trubee. "You know I don't want to appear ungrateful but as it turns out I'm feeling a little bit ungrateful. I don't mind if you're running game in my backyard -- you've got no cause to respect our territorial ambitions -- but given that none of the dead people in this room know how to Star Trek ourselves around California, I'd like a straight answer to this 
[23:10] <03Crion|> question: are your people fucking around with forces you don't understand in my neighborhood?"
[23:11] <03Quaker> It looks like someone has taken a giant three hole punch to his palms at the moment. Or he ran into an accident with a hydraulic press that wouldn’t quit. 
[23:11] <03Crion|> "Because you're right. People don't teleport."
[23:11] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Yikes.
[23:11] <03tom> "Gahhhh," 14the nosferatu burbles, his hands shaking, stumbling out of his chair.
[23:11] <03Quaker> Trubee: “By ‘my people’, do you mean other wizards? Or the people I work for?” 
[23:12] <03VoxPVoxD> "Deacon?"
[23:12] <03tom> "It's okay, I'm okay, just a second here folks." 14He takes one hand in the other and massages his palms. "Should be going away any minute now."
[23:12] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Is he getting worse or is he just still recoiling from how unbelievably fucked this all is?
[23:12] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'd please ask you to answer the first, then the second."
[23:12] <03Crion|> "A straight yes-or-no will do."
[23:12] <03Crion|> "But it's been months since we've seen each other and this is a hell of a reintroduction."
[23:14] <03tom> 14The Deacon somehow didn't seem to notice the injuries on his hands until Frances pointed them out.
[23:14] <03tom> "Okay, so, that part of the vision was real."
01[23:15] <03banana> 6KJ: "The rite you used to still whatsisname's blood. Can you perform it on yourself? Maybe with help?"
01[23:15] <03banana> "You know, the fucker with the sack head thing.. like, the dead birds in the bowl."
[23:16] <03tom> 14He continues to press his palm between thumb and forefinger as the holes shrink and fill into a twin set of divots on the Deacon's palms.
[23:16] <03Quaker> Trubee: “I mean. I’m not the wizard police. But I think I’m the only one south of Anaheim and west of Corona at the moment. So no. And I don’t think my bosses are doing anything they don’t usually do. But who knows? They’re pretty private.” 
[23:17] <03tom> "I'm gonna have to talk to my boss about this," 14Tommy grumbles. "I'm pretty sure I just had some sort of epiphany."
[23:17] <03Crion|> 4Cav sighs and closes his eyes. "Okay. Thank you."
[23:18] <03Crion|> 4He pauses. "Should probably talk to the werewolves, too."
[23:18] <03tom> 14Looking at KJ: "What, the thing with Sponger?"
01[23:18] <03banana> "Yeah, is this.. not the same kind of perpetual bleeding as that?"
01[23:19] <03banana> 6KJ: "It's getting hard to keep track."
[23:19] <03Quaker> Trubee: “How’s the whole Vampire Cop thing going?” 
[23:19] <03tom> "I don't think this is the same thing." 14The divots in the man's palms shrink and smooth over. "I... I mean, maybe?"
[23:19] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That was a curse. This was a blessing."
[23:19] <03tom> "Probably not."
[23:19] <03Crion|> "You know what's really fun though, you guys."
[23:20] <03Crion|> 4Cav's voice doesn't sound very fun.
[23:20] <03VoxPVoxD> 10It'd be worse if it did, probably.
[23:20] <03Crion|> "If it turns out that was all us -- just pure weird vampire horseshit -- you've got a case of a Chrysalis crossing streams with what I assume is either Theban Sorcery or some second-order sort of blood magic."
[23:21] <03Crion|> "I mean, right? We were able to see and hear Tommy in my soul, looking out."
[23:21] <03Crion|> "He was the door we left by."
[23:21] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Sorry, I’m being rude. Who are all of you? I’m Trubee. I’m a w-“ She thinks. “Well, I guess you could say I’m a wizard. But that’s, you know…” She waves her hand. “Other people’s names for what you are. I’m sure you know” She gets up and returns a few moments later with a styrofoam cup of horchata. 
[23:21] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I guess the soul is the soul no matter how you get there."
[23:21] <03Quaker> Frances: “What’s a Chrysalis?” 
[23:21] <03VoxPVoxD> 10To Trubee: "Wilson Frost."
[23:22] <03VoxPVoxD> 10He'd offer her a hand but he's dual wielding tacos.
[23:22] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Instead he offers her a taco.
[23:22] <03Crion|> 4To Trubee: "Hey there, Trubee. I'm Baron Clinton Cavanaugh. Yep, got a promotion."
[23:22] <03tom> "Tommy. Tommy Saldana," 14He's rubbing his palm absently. "Can you even eat those?"
[23:22] <03Quaker> She takes it. “Don’t worry about the bill, by the way. On the house. Get whatever you want.” 
[23:22] <03VoxPVoxD> "That's kind of you."
[23:23] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Can I?” She shows him that yes, she can. 
01[23:23] <03banana> 6KJ: "KJ." 6She's trying not to be jealous of this woman's spotlight-grabbing capabilities, but they're so literal.
[23:23] <03Quaker> Frances nudges KJ. “What’s a Chrysalis?” 
[23:23] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's already eaten one. "I don't usually eat sober. But it's been a long night."
[23:23] <03Crion|> 4To Frances: "You know how caterpillars turn into butterflies via coccoons? It's a coccoon for the soul. Specifically, the Beast -- when you're in Chrysalis, you're like, directly editing the nature of your vampirism."
[23:23] <03VoxPVoxD> "Carnitas here are pretty good."
[23:24] <03Crion|> "Beyond that is probably above your pay grade."
[23:24] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Now who’s doing stuff they don’t understand?” 
[23:24] <03Crion|> 4Kind of remembered the whole "secret society" thing a bit too late.
[23:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Eh. It happens.
[23:24] <03Quaker> Frances: “So what did you edit?” 
[23:25] <03VoxPVoxD> "That's kind of a personal question, isn't it?"
[23:25] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'm constantly doing shit I don't understand, Trubee, but you have my cellphone number and you know where my office is if you have questions about it. I'm just asking that we keep our lines of communication open if we're going to be bumping elbows in Dana Point."
01[23:25] <03banana> 6KJ mumbles a blatant falsehood about all being on the same paygrade, but listens.
[23:25] <03tom> 14Tommy, for his part, returns from behind the RV with a burger.
[23:25] <03tom> "Fuck it, man."
[23:26] <03VoxPVoxD> "There it is."
[23:27] <03Crion|> 4Is there some secret codephrase or sign that LA Ordo members know to give each other to tell who's in and who's out?
[23:27] <03Quaker> There isn’t, as far as Cav knows. 
[23:27] <03Quaker> Trubee shrugs. “I just work here.” 
[23:28] <03Crion|> 4Seems like we should work on that.
[23:28] <03Crion|> 4To Frances: "What's your rank?"
[23:29] <03Quaker> She hesitates. “Hey, it should go both ways, right? What’s going on in San Francisco? I keep hearing weird stuff, but nobody really seems to know what happened.” 
[23:29] <03Quaker> Frances: “In what? I’m a Baron…” 
[23:29] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yeah, well, you and me both."
[23:30] <03Crion|> 4To Frances: "Not the answer I was looking for, I'm afraid. If you can answer that question, then I can answer yours. Until then, I've already said more than I should."
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ turns her attention back to the 'wizard' sharply. "San Francisco?"
[23:31] <03Quaker> Frances nudges KJ: “What’s he talking about?” 
[23:31] <03Quaker> Trubee puts her feet up on the card table, which falls over. “Yep. Frisco. The Big Easy.” 
01[23:32] <03banana> 6To Frances: "I don't know, I haven't managed to uncover all Cav's secrets yet. Should've kept his wifi password."
01[23:32] <03banana> 6To Trubee: "Well, do you want to know anything newer than four years old?"
[23:33] <03tom> "Didn't the Carthians roll into S.F. a few years back?"
[23:33] <03tom> "Dunno, haven't been."
[23:33] <03Quaker> Trubee: “No, I mean what happened like…last month. Maybe more recently.” 
01[23:35] <03banana> "No idea, then. Hopefully it was disruptive."
[23:36] <03Quaker> Trubee: “That’s the sense I got.” 
[23:36] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "When it comes to court business, they might as well not have invented telephones yet, let alone the internet. We don't hear what's happening in San Francisco until months afterwards."
[23:36] <03Crion|> "Could try asking the secret police, if you can find them."
[23:36] <03Quaker> She sips her horchata for a moment. “Oh, you meant like in the tech way. No, I mean like…bad disruption. It was bad.” 
[23:37] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Are any of you in the secret police?” 
[23:37] <03Quaker> Wilson’s phone rings. 
[23:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson checks it.
[23:37] <03tom> 14Tommy: "Uh yeah, got me."
[23:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Who's calling?
[23:37] <03Quaker> It’s Blythe. 
[23:37] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I gotta take this. Excuse me."
[23:38] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Okay. So what happened in San Francisco?” 
[23:38] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "He's not being serious."
[23:38] <03Crion|> 4Cav turns to look at Tommy. "Tell me you're not being serious."
01[23:39] <03banana> "We'd be talking, like, the Carmelite secret police."
[23:39] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Are they still a thing?” 
01[23:39] <03banana> "That's not VERY secret, or at least not very police. But if you know something cool and want to share, we're basically having a weird nightanyway.."
[23:39] <03VoxPVoxD> 10He'll head around out of earshot (unaware that some people can just psychically spy on cell signals). "Evening."
[23:39] <03tom> 14Tommy has a burger half-wedged into his mouth, revealing an entire row of needle-like upper teeth. "Nhhh, shhry."
[23:40] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Hello, Wilson. Are you having a pleasant evening?” 
[23:40] <03tom> "I wanted to be the one dropping bombs for once."
[23:41] <03tom> "Nobody tells me anything, man! I live in a basement, dude."
[23:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Not really. You could call it 'interesting', maybe. How are you?"
[23:41] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Oh. I’m getting the sense that maybe I know more than you do about this.” 
[23:42] <03tom> "I'm dumb as shit, friend."
01[23:43] <03banana> 6KJ: "I mean. You seem to be basically aware that we're undead vampires, right."
[23:43] <03tom> "Yeah uh, we're cool, right?"
[23:43] <03Quaker> Blythe: “I’m doing well, thank you. I have good news!” 
[23:43] <03tom> "You're not gonna like, tell anybody about that, right?"
[23:43] <03Crion|> 4Cav meanwhile is on his phone, texting Santiago, the last guy he has who passes for a friend in court life that isn't in the room here with him.
01[23:43] <03banana> "Due to various vampire things, we have pretty segregated territories and SF's a long way away. Also it hates us."
[23:43] <03Crion|> 4He's trying to run down this San Francisco thing. Has Santiago heard anything?
[23:43] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I would love some good news."
[23:44] <03tom> "I'm just saying that like, officially, we're not supposed to talk to people about that, y'know?"
[23:44] <03tom> "But if we're all on the level, here.."
01[23:44] <03banana> 6KJ: "I think tonight is a holiday from normality."
[23:44] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Huh? Oh, yeah. No, I know about it. Don’t worry, I’m not going to tell anyone.” 
[23:45] <03Quaker> Santiago: <Hold on let me ask teresa. weve both been kind of keeping our heads down so idk if shes heard anything> 
[23:45] <03tom> 14Tommy raises his arms. "It's cool, you know. I mean.. I've always wanted to just tell someone, you know. Be all just like, 'Psyche, assholes!"
[23:46] <03Quaker> Blythe: “You sound like you could use a vacation. Somewhere tropical, with nice beaches.” 
[23:47] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Ohhhhh yes."
01[23:47] <03banana> 6KJ isn't interested in eating tacos but the smell is kind of nice. Reminds her of college. "So how did you become a wizard exactly? Do you have to get bit by another one?"
[23:48] <03tom> "But ah, you know," 14murmurs the Deacon while wiping his chin with a napkin. "Frowned on,"
[23:49] <03Quaker> Blythe: “Well, that’s the good news. I might have volunteered you for some relaxing sinecure duty.” 
[23:50] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Nobody knows. It’s kind of a lottery thing. People have their theories.” 
[23:52] <03tom> "Lucky."
01[23:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Is it? Surely there are some mystical drawbacks, deadly banes and stuff like that."
[23:52] <03Quaker> Santiago: <some kind of comms blackout? they haven’t assigned a new ambassador up there since abigail gannon came back. thats odd> 
[23:53] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "When and where? I'll start walking on the highway now if I have to."
[23:53] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Well, kind of. Reality doesn’t really…mesh…with what we can do. Well, you know. ‘Reality’.” 
[23:53] <03Crion|> 4Cav: <yeah, seems to be the case all over. i've got our old wiz kid friend Trubee here asking what we know. caught me flatfooted>
[23:54] <03Quaker> Santiago: <oh nice. tell her me and teresa say hi> 
[23:54] <03VoxPVoxD> "What's the bad news? That affects whether I walk into or with traffic."
[23:56] <03Quaker> Wilson can practically hear Blythe wind the landline’s cord around her finger and smile. “Don’t joke. There isn’t any bad news, for once. But that’s all I’m going to tell you. The rest you’ll have to find out. Oh! Don’t forget to ask Modjeska for help once you’ve gotten the job. You should be hearing about it any second, the meeting just ended. I have to run, actually.” 
[23:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Aww. Alright. I'll talk to you later."
01[23:57] <03banana> 6KJ: "You've got scarequotes on reality there. We kind of need that stuff."
[23:57] <03Crion|> 4Cav: <sure thing>
[23:58] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Santiago Aguilar and the Baroness Modjeska extend their greetings, Trubee."
[23:59] <03Quaker> Trubee: “It’s just that…you know how after you were embraced, you kind of gained a new superstructure for understanding the world? It’s like that. Oh, nice. How are they?” 
Session Time: Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03Quaker> “Hey, by the way, you said you were messing with your soul earlier? Were you, uh…what exactly were you doing? Like, did you expect certain effects, or…” 
[00:01] <03Quaker> KJ, Cav, and Wilson’s phones ring. 
[00:02] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yeah. I was--"
[00:02] <03VoxPVoxD> 10There it is.
[00:02] <03Crion|> 4He looks around the room.
[00:02] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Wilson."
[00:02] <03Crion|> "Well, shit."
01[00:02] <03banana> 6To Frances: "It feels like a glimpse of an alternative fraternity, doesn't it? Some loose grouping of weird and arcane people which doesn't center solely around our rites and factions. I wonder how many have glimpsed this-" 
[00:02] <03Crion|> 4Cavanaugh: "Cavanaugh."
01[00:02] <03banana> 6KJ: "Anaheim."
[00:03] <03Quaker> Trubee whispers to Tommy while the others take their phone. “Did Cavanaugh and that one-“ she indicates Wilson - “have some kind of…bond, before?” 
[00:04] <03Quaker> Rosa Isaacs is on the other end of the line. “Good evening, Barons. Are you able to speak freely at the moment?” 
[00:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Are we all being conferenced?
[00:04] <03Quaker> Yeah, it’s all one call. 
[00:04] <03VoxPVoxD> 10In that case Wilson'll walk over to the others, still on the phone.
[00:05] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What's the call, Seneschal?"
[00:05] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Trubee, we need the room. Sorry."
[00:05] <03tom> 14Tommy glances at Trubee, then at Clinton Cavanaugh before shaking his head.
01[00:05] <03banana> 6KJ is trying not to laugh. "Just a sec, we'll get to somewhere private."
[00:05] <03Crion|> 4To Rosa: "Frances Yuan is here with us, is that acceptable?"
[00:06] <03tom> "Should I, like.." 14Tommy offers to leave.
01[00:06] <03banana> 6She MUST be able to hear us through each other's phones. What an absurd night.
[00:06] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Yes, that’s fine.” 
[00:06] <03VoxPVoxD> 10It's not the least absurd night we've ever had.
[00:06] <03Crion|> 4Cav shakes his head to Tommy. "We've also got a Deacon with us."
[00:06] <03Crion|> "Tommy Saldana."
[00:06] <03Quaker> Trubee gets up. “Okay. We’ll be over there.” She takes Tommy and walks out towards the far side of the parking lot. 
[00:07] <03Crion|> "We'll send him out."
[00:07] <03Crion|> "...Okay."
03[00:07] * Joins: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net)
01[00:08] <03banana> "Sorry about the echo, Rosa."
[00:08] <03Quaker> Rosa: “I have a request for you the three of you. It comes from the Prince. It will take anywhere from one to two weeks and will require travel to another city. Is that something you’re all comfortable with?”
[00:09] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "...What city."
[00:09] <03Quaker> Trubee pulls a joint out of her pocket. “You want some?” 
[00:09] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I could use a vacation."
[00:10] <03tom> 14Tommy: "Hell yes."
[00:10] <03tom> "Trust me, these people-" 14the Deacon gestures back over the beach toward the conference call- "they somehow find a way to make being dead even worse."
[00:11] <03tom> "Don't get involved in it."
[00:11] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Oh, right, fire. Um…hold on a sec.” She taps it with the tip of a finger and Tommy can feel the air superheat itself around the joint’s end. Without any visible flame, it starts smoking. Trubee takes a hit and passes it along. 
[00:11] <03Quaker> “Yeah? How’s the whole, uh…religion thing going? You’re with the Vampires for Christ, right?” 
[00:11] <03tom> "Can I pay you to follow me around."
01[00:12] <03banana> 6The Prince. Then either it's something KJ doesn't need to report or, she's suspected more recently, something she shouldn't report. Depending on who really works for whom. There's the other side of all this shit. ..she forgot to actually answer! "Yes, it should be ok. Particularly if we've got time to delegate ongoings."
[00:14] <03Quaker> Rosa: “San Diego. I won’t bore you with the details before you accept, but we’d like to have more representatives at the signing of several treaties and the following social engagements, as a gesture of trust and goodwill. You’d only need to stand there and be polite at a party. And in the meantime, you’ll have diplomatic status and the rest of your time to yourself to do as you like.” 
[00:15] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Sorry. I should be more respectful.” 
[00:16] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yes, that shouldn't be a problem."
[00:16] <03Crion|> 4The last time Cav was in San Diego he shot up an office building.
[00:16] <03tom> 14The Deacon exercises iron discipline as he hits the rollie, having reached the decision that he'd rather die than allow himself to show weakness in front of Trubee. He doesn't cough, but instead shudders and clenches his fists. "Oh, you know," 14He gasps, taking another hit.
[00:16] <03tom> "It's going."
[00:16] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Are they gonna make me pray rosaries?"
[00:17] <03tom> "We're trying to see if there's any appeal for, you know, basically the same gospel but with less murder."
[00:17] <03Quaker> Rosa: “They certainly can’t make you do anything. You’ll be traveling as representatives of the Prince and the Court. It might be prudent to observe some local customs, of course.” 
[00:18] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'll look out for any helicopters."
[00:18] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Long as they don't burn me at the stake for being Jewish, I'm in."
01[00:18] <03banana> 6The three of us.. we were all frontliners in San Diego, weren't we? Nice message to send. "What is it, left shoulder-right shoulder-heart-forehead? No problems here."
[00:20] <03tom> 14Saldana lets the wizard's words sink in: "You know about us, though?"
[00:20] <03Crion|> 4Nah, Cavanaugh was, uh, special forces.
[00:21] <03Crion|> 4Currently he's trying to remember if he left anyone alive that might hold a grudge.
[00:21] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Just the basics. You meet all kinds of people around here.” 
[00:24] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Good. Of course, you’ll be allowed to take any retainers or helpers you wish. The Ambassador’s office will make all the necessary travel arrangements once you contact them. I don’t know if you’ll be comfortable bunking together in the Residence downtown. If you aren’t, you’ll have to find lodging on your own. What else…bring your armor, and formal dress. I’m sure you remember how they are down there. Oh,
[00:24] <03Quaker> and…” 
[00:24] <03Quaker> Rosa: “The reward for this.” 
[00:24] <03Crion|> 4Bring his armor. Right.
[00:24] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Is getting out of town not its own reward?
[00:26] <03tom> "Figures," 14Tommy concludes. "You have any stake in that, or just curious?"
[00:27] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Not really. I wasn’t raised religious.” 
01[00:27] <03banana> 6KJ minimises her dialer app for a sec to tap out 'Surprised theres a reward tbh' and wave it at the others.
[00:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson just nods.
[00:28] <03tom> "Shit, me neither." 14Tommy returns Trubee her joint. "But then, y'know, this happens."
[00:28] <03tom> "I mean, having this happen to you is a bit of a shakeup."
[00:29] <03Quaker> Rosa: “You’ll be given a permanent nightly stipend for three. And, because this trust carries certain responsibilities on your part, a tour of the Ventura facilities. As a promise of mutual confidence.” 
[00:29] <03VoxPVoxD> 10At this, Wilson looks at Cav, eyebrows up.
[00:29] <03tom> 14He looks down at his mottled skin.
01[00:30] <03banana> "I appreciate it, Seneschal." 6We're great people to keep confidences and don't just go around telling secrets to 'wizards' all night.
[00:30] <03Quaker> Trubee: “I guess. It’s hard to…” She looks down at the joint. “Different wizards have different ways of waking up. Some are less…agnostic than others.” 
[00:31] <03Quaker> “Do you know any sorcery yet?” 
[00:33] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Of course. The reward is conditional, though. I don’t expect you to have any problems, but the Prince also would like you to refrain from any kind of antagonistic actions. No blood if you spill blood unnecessarily. Self-defense is still perfectly acceptable.” 
[00:33] <03tom> 14Tommy is sullen: "We don't have a lot of people that can teach me, and they're pretty busy."
01[00:34] <03banana> 6KJ: "It will be interesting to meet some of the Sublime Court's people on dealing terms."
[00:34] <03tom> "But I mean, that's... that's internal affairs, you know? Not supposed to spread that stuff around."
[00:35] <03tom> "This is all off-record."
[00:35] <03Quaker> Trubee touches her ear. “Sorry guys, you have to stop recording.” 
[00:36] <03tom> 14Tommy laughs. "For real?"
[00:36] <03Quaker> Trubee: “No, not really. You guys are kind of paranoid, huh?” 
[00:36] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson asks the question off the first page of the Invictus handbook. "Who's in charge? Are we reporting to someone or is it just us down there?"
[00:37] <03tom> "Yeah."
[00:37] <03tom> "You could say that."
[00:37] <03tom> "I mean," 14Saldana continues, "I hear a couple guys we got can do real, no-shit miracles."
[00:37] <03tom> "But if they could do that, we wouldn't be getting pushed around by the court, right?"
[00:39] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Abigail Gannon has been the ambassador since relations have been re-established with the Sublime Court. Baron Cavanaugh met her predecessor. But her nightly administrative duties take up most of her time, so she rarely leaves the city’s downtown for anything except engagements where her presence is required. You can look to her and her staff for guidance and support.” 
[00:40] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Gannon. Alright. Anything else?"
01[00:40] <03banana> 6KJ: "It's a show-of-status thing, so I'm guessing retainers are encouraged."
01[00:41] <03banana> 6Wilson had a Dora or something? She's never seen Cavanaugh with cronies..
[00:41] <03Quaker> Rosa: “That’s it. Her people will inform you in more detail. I’ll send you all the number. Yes, retainers are welcome. Bring who you’d like, as long as they can wear a suit and behave.” 
[00:42] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Miracles are less effective than you might think.” 
[00:42] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Sounds good. Thanks for the opportunity."
[00:43] <03Quaker> Rosa: “Leave either tomorrow night or the night after. Have a good trip. Goodnight.” The line dies. 
[00:44] <03tom> 14Saldana chuckles. "Yeah, I guess so."
[00:45] <03tom> "Why, you have firsthand experience?"
01[00:45] <03banana> 6KJ's already talking the moment the connection dies. "This is too many coincidences."
01[00:46] <03banana> "Don't get me wrong, you guys are great. I'm kind of looking forward to the trip. But there are.. factions acting here. Groups. Seeing us as a group maybe. Looking for sides to be taken."
[00:46] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson'll shoot a group text to Nora and Cora, who will (in zero and two minutes respectively) grab their phones off their nightstands to see the message and then let out a sigh of relief that Wilson didn't wrap his car around a telephone pole or something before going back to sleep. "It's a lot of coincidences."
[00:47] <03Quaker> Trubee: “What’s a miracle? Being able to throw fire around? Lightning from your fingertips?” 
01[00:48] <03banana> "Yeah, like: it's cool that you were hacking your souls or whatever-" 6actually it is not cool- "but that just happens to get some wizard's attention? Following on from this diary thing, and now we're being caught up in something which will keep us out of town and unable to pursue that?"
02[00:48] * Quits: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[00:49] <03tom> "I mean, yeah?"
[00:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Next, Wilson is thumbing down his contacts list for TESS OKIENKA. "Assuming this order really is coming from the Prince, my guess is he's moving us out of the city for what he's decided is our own good."
[00:49] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Aaaand call.
[00:49] <03tom> "Although it's usually something more momentous, like... uh... fire that burns without heat?"
[00:49] <03tom> "A bush that burns but never exhausts itself?"
01[00:49] <03banana> "Out of town while Cavanaugh has Count Long Beach's amnesiac-sycophants tucked away. It's not even- not even good or bad luck."
[00:50] <03Quaker> Teresa picks up. “-Santiago, turn it down - Hello?” 
01[00:50] <03banana> 6Is Frances still here? Fuck it, KJ has to trust someone to not be watching her.
01[00:50] <03banana> 6Well technically she doesn't. Keep that option open.
[00:50] <03Quaker> Frances is still there, good-naturedly eating a burrito. 
[00:52] <03tom> "I mean, it's not about how it looks, it's about what it does."
[00:52] <03tom> "Most miracles are meant to signal that, like, there is actually a heavenly father and He does, in fact, give a shit about us."
[00:52] <03tom> "It's not just about being able to do cool shit, although it very much is."
[00:53] <03tom> "You haven't seen anything like that?"
01[00:53] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hey. If someone storms Disneyland while I'm away, would you mind calling with a heads-up?"
[00:54] <03Quaker> Trubee: “I have. Maybe. It might have been a hallucination from blood loss.” 
[00:54] <03tom> "Hey, well, that's at least as sane as what I just went through."
[00:54] <03Quaker> Frances nods. “Do you want me to hide Bren’s lackeys for you while you’re away?” 
[00:55] <03tom> "I mean, like, I just remember feeling really.. at peace, like I was wrapped up in a big comfy blanket, and then there's like, holes in my hands."
[00:55] <03tom> "I'm a member of the Church, so, obviously I have to take this seriously."
[00:57] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Tess! How are you? How's the fiance?"
[00:57] <03Quaker> Trubee: “I know the feeling. Perfect belonging. Perfect understanding.” 
01[00:57] <03banana> 6Seems like Cavanaugh's call, but KJ's definitely nodding at the idea. It'd totally do Frances some good to have something more dangerous to do than interior decoration!
[00:58] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Both excellent, thank you. How are you, Baron? What can I help you with?” 
02[00:59] * Quits: Crion| (Crion@sorcery-00t34t.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[01:00] <03tom> 14Tommy is quiet for a little while. "Yeah, well.. it's been real nice. Lot to think about, y'know."
[01:00] <03tom> "Say uh.."
[01:01] <03tom> "Why.. why didn't anyone tell me that you guys exist?"
[01:03] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm doing just fine. I got a call from Rosa just now. The Prince is sending me and two of the new barons down to San Diego as a diplomatic envoy. You heard about this yet?" 10He looks up at KJ and sees her intently focused not on Wilson, so he saves her the trouble and puts his phone on the table on speaker. "You know Barons Cavanaugh and Valentine, right? Laguna and 
[01:03] <03VoxPVoxD> Anaheim?"
[01:05] <03Quaker> Trubee puts out the joint. “‘For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.’” She shrugs. “We don’t cross paths that often, I don’t think. Maybe we’re both too wrapped up in our own things to care about every other weird secret hierarchy.” 
01[01:05] <03banana> 6KJ: "Hey." 6Who's Frost got on the line?
[01:06] <03tom> "Hey, I can appreciate it. We all up in our own shit."
[01:07] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Hello. Yes, I know them. No, I hadn’t heard about this. Why you three?” 
[01:07] <03tom> "Well..." 14Deacon Saldana stands. "If you ever need to talk to someone in our order, drop me a line?"
[01:07] <03tom> "I got shit I need to do tonight."
[01:07] <03Quaker> Trubee: “Sure. Are you guys hiring? I kind of hate this job. It’s just a bouncing gig, really.”

[01:11] <03VoxPVoxD> "I couldn't guess, honestly," 10Wilson says. "Maybe he picked our names out of a hat. Anyway, we're going to be representing the Brilliant Court down south, and with Cavanaugh and Valentine being less established and me being me, a gesture of support from an old and respected family would go a long way to boost our credibility."
[01:12] <03tom> 14Tommy chews his lip. "You know? I bet I could find you something."
[01:12] <03tom> 14He lifts his cell phone. "Trade numbers?"
[01:13] <03Quaker> Trubee waves her hand and his phone dings. “Done.” She checks her watch. “Shit. Can you guys get a Lyft or something home? I gotta get back to work.” 
[01:14] <03tom> 14Tommy is already gone.

I don’t know if they know it, and I’m no expert of Fate, but it looks like something’s stuck their souls together. Might not be great for both if something were to happen to one of them.” 
[01:16] <03Quaker> She throws her cup and plate in a trash can, and then walks back to the RV, sticking her key in. The light goes green, she pulls on the lever until the icon shows the money bag, and then the RV shutters itself and she steps through.

[01:27] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "If you could get us an in with your relatives down there, a place to stay that isn't us all bunking in the Ambassador's residence, that'd work wonders."
[01:28] <03Quaker> Teresa: “Hm.” 
[01:29] <03Quaker> “It might come with strings. Things are…complicated, down there.” 
[01:30] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Any idea what kind of strings? I don't want to make commitments for the other Barons that get them pissed at me for the whole trip."
[01:31] <03Quaker> “You know my sire. And my aunt and cousin. My relatives in San Diego are less straightforward. You might find yourself caught up in some plot. Or not. I don’t know. My…other aunt is a bit hard to predict.” 
[01:31] <03Quaker> “She’s a bit of a grey sheep.” 
[01:32] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Weird's not so bad. Is she nice?"
[01:34] <03Quaker> “Oh, don’t misunderstand - I love and admire her. But she has this maddening drive for intrigue and revolt. It can be a bit exhausting. She’s very nice, though. Not at all like the San Diego stereotype.” 
[01:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Well, I'll run it by the others, but that's no problem for me. I'm good at staying out of trouble."
[01:35] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Not like he's ever consorted with traitors before. Haha.
[01:37] <03Quaker> “How much do you know about San Diego, anyway?” 
[01:38] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I know what everybody knows, I guess. It's never been my business to know more."
[01:40] <03Quaker> “Mm. What ‘everybody knows’ often turns out to be hopelessly provincial. I suppose my aunt will get you up to speed. It’s a bit more complex than our caricatures. They have about half a dozen Princes and Princesses, to start. They answer to the Grand Prince, Iago Morales. In theory, anyway. If we’re neofeudal, they’re just feudal.” 
[01:41] <03VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "See, now I'm jealous. We should have princesses."
[01:42] <03Quaker> “My aunt controls La Jolla, which is a rich little suburb north of the city. You’d be staying with her there. It’s a very pleasant place to relax. I was split between there and somewhere more exotic for the honeymoon, actually.” 
[01:42] <03VoxPVoxD> "That sounds nice. What's her name?"
[01:43] <03Quaker> “How many do you want?” 
[01:43] <03VoxPVoxD> "All of em."
[01:46] <03Quaker> “Elena Ignacia Maria Figueroa de Solano y Medina. I only ever called her ‘Elena,” or ‘Tia’, or “Princess Solano.’ Or ‘ the Princess La Jolla’, if we were being formal.” 
[01:48] <03Quaker> “Pretty exhausting. I only ever use two of mine, and I don’t regret it.”

[10:02] <03trenchfoot> 13She hesitates for a long moment before scrabbling to her feet and dead-on sprinting away from the monster. She couldn't even save their bodies. Xia Lan won't slow down until she can't hear it behind her anymore.
[10:08] <03VoxPVoxD> Xia Lan finds herself blinded by the morning sun, the ground heat-baked already, the shadowland a mirage behind her. With no water, no compass, and no drive to go on, she must get home.
[10:11] <03VoxPVoxD> She makes it over hardpan and past ancient dried lakebeds, and through mile after mile of featureless red desert. She finds the strength to stay on her feet, her will refusing to let her "ssSSSSSSSS" a snake emerges from the brush, mottled black and tan! It lunges at Xia Lan!
[10:17] <03trenchfoot> 13She stumbles back, lashing out with her hook sword as she dodges away from the snake. Something about facing death makes you less likely to shriek in terror and fall over yourself to get away from a single, puny snake.
[10:19] <03VoxPVoxD> Her blow strikes home! Xia Lan hears the serpent scrape hideously against her hook sword, but it can't cut through. Instead, the serpent winds against the blade, sliding along it as if it were smooth as a tree branch. She has no hope of avoiding the bite.
[10:20] <03trenchfoot> 13Oh no.
[10:20] <03VoxPVoxD> Xia's vision swims. Her arm burns. Her shoulder burns. Her chest burns -- every breath comes in like fire. She collapses, on her hands and knees in the desert, as the snake winds itself free.
[10:22] <03VoxPVoxD> The serpent cuts a path through the dusty ground into the brush. Xia watches it insinuate itself into the branches of a barren brown bush. Xia and the bush alike cast no shadow. The sun is directly overhead.
[10:24] <03VoxPVoxD> Xia sees the bush ignite, red and gold and white, a flame that pillars high into the sky but doesn't spread through the underbrush. It's then that Xia hears a voice. A voice that comes from everywhere. A voice that calls her name.
[10:24] <03VoxPVoxD> Xia Lan.
[10:25] <03VoxPVoxD> My daughter. My herald. My best self.
[10:28] <03trenchfoot> 13She can't even muster the energy to cry. She chokes out the words, mostly to the ground: "Let me die in peace."
[10:30] <03VoxPVoxD> No.
[10:31] <03VoxPVoxD> No death. No peace. Not for you.
[10:32] <03VoxPVoxD> You suffer as I suffered. To fail and be failed. To touch the ruins of what we loved and turn away.
[10:33] <03VoxPVoxD> No more.
[10:34] <03VoxPVoxD> You are not lost. You are not defeated. You are not alone.
[10:37] <03VoxPVoxD> Know that I am the Sun Unconquered. You will rise. You will find kin.
[10:47] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan manages to look at the burning bush, leaning on her side. This has to be some dream her body's cooked up to make her last moments less miserable. She waves an arm towards the desert expanse, dropping it back down at her side; Not lost? Not defeated? Not alone? "I'm already dead. Save somebody else."
[10:48] <03VoxPVoxD> I will not save you.
[10:48] <03VoxPVoxD> You will.
[10:49] <03VoxPVoxD> You will save yourself and then you will save me.
[10:50] <03trenchfoot> 13She squints at the bush. "You... really are the Sun?"
[10:52] <03VoxPVoxD> The burning in her chest is almost unbearable now.
[10:54] <03VoxPVoxD> The bush flares white-hot, impossible to ignore. Xia's eyes burn and sting.
[10:54] <03VoxPVoxD> I AM. I AM
[10:55] <03VoxPVoxD> DOUBT IF YOU MUST. BELIEVE WHAT YOU MUST. BUT YOU ARE MY CHOSEN AND YOU WILL MARCH INTO THE FLAME.
[10:57] <03trenchfoot> 13She winces, but does not turn away. Instead, she begins to crawl towards the burning bush.
[10:57] <03VoxPVoxD> Xia might interpret the tremendous heat and pressure she feels bearing down on her body as pain. It's as if all the world's caught fire and it's all converging on her at once.
[10:58] <03VoxPVoxD> WALK INTO FIRE. RISE UNFETTERED. BE REBORN.
[10:58] <03VoxPVoxD> Breathe in.
[11:10] <03trenchfoot> 13Glorious golden hearts shine down from on high, blindingly brilliant in the noonday sun, shimmering and dancing, rising ever higher as more and more appear. The desert wind whips at the sand, but she can't even feel it. Her anima surrounds the Unfettered Xia Lan, who rises to her feet and faces the Sun.

01[22:11] <03[banana]> 6After delegating some tasks she's interested in and some things she should be interested in, KJ retreats to the secure room on the other side of Anaheim. Nobody sees an alleyway door open and if they did see, they wouldn't see anyone enter. Inside her digital stronghold, she's confronted with a familiar problem.
01[22:12] <03[banana]> 6What worked so well among mortals and the neonates of the Brilliant Court is turning out to be pretty shit. It's not even that they're smart, that's the worst bit.
01[22:13] <03[banana]> 6The elders and ancilla of the Invictus don't have high-tech security, they just.. don't compute. They don't care or they don't even understand. They're too far away from the modern world to hook them- or they don't seem to realise the possibilities which should be bait.
01[22:13] <03[banana]> 6She has Baron Laguna's entire damn email archive here and the word 'chrysalis' doesn't appear once.
01[22:16] <03[banana]> 6Well. If 'Baron' is really meant to mean something, she's got an email to write. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
01[22:18] <03[banana]> 6KJ: Cavanaugh has been sent to dance attendance on San Diego. This is the Prince's request by way of the Seneschal and is supposedly a matter of showing strength while diplomacy takes place offscreen. 
01[22:19] <03[banana]> 6KJ: I will also attend, and we're likely to stay with relatives of Modjeska. Further updates if necessary or when we return in two weeks.

01[22:20] <03[banana]> 6She doesn't address it to the dead drop yet, doesn't hit esc-ZZ to send. This would be her second actual report, the first since the Ma thing.
01[22:22] <03[banana]> 6Is it necessary to send a report at all, if the spymaster knows about official postings like this? But.. does she? Is there still a real threat, with Donald Bren incapacitated and weird suggestions of counter-allegiance from all directions?
01[22:25] <03[banana]> 6It's a question of who to betray at this point, so KJ Valentine leaves the terminal open and distracts herself with newsfeeds and text messages and speculation about remote viewing until she's made a decision by default.

[10:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Hmm. "Nevermind." 13She shakes her head. "So, are you going to make me sad?"
[10:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> Bamaz: "Ohhhhh, you have the better of me. It's so hard to say no to such a pretty face."
[10:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I have some texts from this period. What are you looking for, precisely?"
[10:26] <03trenchfoot> 13She hesitates. "...songs. And failures, both personal and public. Religious rites. Any and all of the above."
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And what will you pay me?"
[10:31] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "Name a price and I will pay it." 13It strikes her that this is, perhaps, not a great idea. But at this point, this is the best lead she's gotten yet, and she's desperate.
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> Bamaz laughs.
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh, don't say that."
[10:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Such texts are precious to you, yes?"
[10:34] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "...in a way."
[10:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sacred, perhaps?"
[10:35] <03trenchfoot> "Some would call them such."
[10:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Suppose I asked a favor. A favor that would put you in contact with a colleague of mine, whose collection dwarfs my own."
[10:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "But you would have to travel very far."
[10:37] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "I'm listening."
[10:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I owe a debt to a man like myself, who makes his trade in Nexus. My terms are, you will accept both the text and the debt. You will see the text when you accept the deal."
[10:40] <03trenchfoot> 13She pauses, at this point. This isn't regular. "That's some bargain. Most merchants request coin."
[10:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I am not most merchants and you, my sweet, are not most customers."
[10:41] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "...name your debt."
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I can tell you only what I received. It's not for me to say the debt is square - only to say that we are fair. Scrupulously fair."
[10:44] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "Devilish." 13She says it bored, casually. "I haven't heard a price."
[10:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> Bamaz scoffs. "I told you. I owe a man a favor. The deal is, you get the hymn and now you owe the man a favor. It's not any particular favor. It's whatever satisfies the debt in his eyes."
[10:54] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "Okay, I'll bite. What favor do you owe him? I've never had... dealings, like this."
[10:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> Bamaz: "He paid for my freedom."
[10:56] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "That's a hard price to match."
[10:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You can see why I want you to do it instead."
[11:00] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "..."
[11:01] <03trenchfoot> "...do we cut our palms open and sign in blood? Spit shake?"
[11:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> Bamaz has put his pipe out, but his nostrils are streaming smoke all the same. "Come and shake a poor sinner's hand."
[11:08] <03trenchfoot> 13Xia Lan: "I never gave you my name." 13She reaches a hand out regardless, grinning. "The Unfettered Xia Lan, daughter of the Sun. Historian, bargainer of devils, and singer - come see me before I head to Nexus. I'll get you some VIP seats."
[11:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> Xia Lan takes Bamaz's hand, and the smoke seems to envelop them. There's no sign of Bamaz's bookshop anymore, or sounds from the streets outside. There's no sign of Bamaz either, come to think of it, save the swirling smoke, the glint of his eyes like coals in the dark, and the hot steady pressure of his hand on hers. The pressure builds on her like the heat of a day in Zoatham.
[11:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> And then the smoke evaporates, the pressure breaks, and Xia Lan is alone, in an empty storefront in an abandoned building. She's standing over an ash-streaked counter in front of a pane of glass that catches the glare from the lanterns outside like a mirror. She needs to hold it up to see the music.
[11:16] <03trenchfoot> 13She reads it eagerly, wishing to internalize that which she bargained for. To learn this, to perform this - that she'll have to make her way to Nexus afterwards seems secondary.
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's got a lot of verses and sort of a marching beat. It's a simple song; the sort you lead people in instead of performing at recital. Xia can read the entire thing if she looks closely, but the last verse is the least faded:
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> He is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> So the world shall be his footstool, and the soul of wrong his slave
[11:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> Our God is marching on
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> On the back of the frame is a note with a name and an address:
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> The address is a bookshop in the Firewander district. The name is "Vladok".
[11:26] <03trenchfoot> 13She hums the song to herself quietly in the abandoned shop. Mouthing the words, guessing at the ones that are completely lost - she'll have to retranslate it, perhaps... She doesn't even think to question whether it was worth it as she strides out of what used to be Bamaz the Bookbinder's shop, on her way to arrange passage to Nexus. A debt must be repaid, after all.

[22:51] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXMfF1-d8MU
[22:51] <03Quaker> When’s the last time you traveled by train? 
[22:51] <03Crion|> 4When Cav lived in New York.
[22:51] <03Crion|> 4Well.
[22:51] <03Crion|> 4'Lived.'
01[22:52] <03banana> 6When KJ moved to San Francisco, she took BART until her first paycheck cleared.
[22:55] <03Quaker> Then they probably had a more efficient and less expensive experience than Amtrak, which is the only line servicing the route down to San Diego’s Old Town, where they’ll meet people from the Embassy. At least their tickets were free. 
[22:56] <03Crion|> 4Even east coast Amtrak's a better experience than west coast Amtrak.
[22:56] <03Crion|> 4Cav will choose a seat in the quiet car and spend most of the ride texting Kay and the office.
[22:57] <03Crion|> 4Nix that. He'll be bringing the Bry/ians down with him.
[22:58] <03Crion|> 4He's annoyed that it's a work trip. Cav really would have preferred to be coming down here with her instead.
[22:58] <03Quaker> At the San Juan Capistrano station, the late hour has cleared out most visitors to the old city’s historic downtown. The last tourists are headed home as you get there, pulling jackets on as the temperature dips below 65. The station itself is little more than a low brick structure and more brick arches next to a long platform of pink cobblestone. Palm trees line the little lane, and the train, starting with the massive block 
[22:58] <03Quaker> of an engine, is idling under the boughs of a massive pepper tree. 
[22:58] <03Quaker> Who sees them off? At least it’s much more romantic a setting than being dropped off at an airport terminal. 
01[22:59] <03banana> 6You get what you pay for. KJ wrinkled her nose at the complementary ticket, but it's better than driving through enemy territory..
[23:00] <03Crion|> 4Cav will have already said his farewells to Kay (she's keeping a night schedule at the moment, but he's still trying to keep a wall between his work and their relationship).
[23:00] <03Crion|> 4(Everyone stays healthier that way.)
01[23:01] <03banana> 6She arrives at the station with one gofer, a colourless young woman in a tracksuit who's juggling a briefcase, KJ's suitcase, and her smaller own.
[23:01] <03Quaker> The Ambassador’s office has reassured them that it’s perfectly safe. No one on either side has ever attacked a train. Some things are more useful as neutral ground. 
[23:02] <03Crion|> 4Cav glances at the woman with a raised eyebrow before turning to KJ. Rush and Buchanon are probably standing off a bit, talking amongst themselves or on the phone. If either of those two has significant others or family they want to bring, Cav will have bought tickets through the office for them.
01[23:02] <03banana> "Zelda, this is the Baron of Laguna Beach, Shepherd of Crook and Cross, protector-emeritus of the Orange Territory that was. Cav, Zelda Essos."
[23:02] <03Crion|> 4It's not a vacation for Cav, but there's no reason it shouldn't be for them.
[23:03] <03Quaker> Neither do. Also, the only email they’ve gotten from the actual Ambassador and not her staff has assured them that they can treat it as a vacation in all but name. In fact, there were a lot of smiley emojis put in her letter to emphasize this. 
01[23:04] <03banana> 6Zelda says nothing but makes the correct degree of bow. The Baron of Laguna Etcetera might catch an unguarded appraising look - at his mouth. Everything about her screams 'blood addict'.
[23:04] <03Crion|> 4Cav smiles. "Good evening, Zelda." 4To KJ: "Good evening, Baron Anaheim. You've met my retainers, Bryan Rush and Brian Buchanon."
[23:04] <03Crion|> 4At the very least they crossed paths in the aftermath of the incident at Cav's office.
01[23:05] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah, good to work with you more visibly. Did all those smileys render properly for you?"
01[23:05] <03banana> 6(That second sentence was to Cav, though really she never looked at the staff properly anyway.)
[23:07] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I keep my fonts up to date."
01[23:07] <03banana> 6KJ: "It's not so bad to be taking a night train to the border. That's the sort of thing they option for a screenplay."
03[23:07] * Joins: tom (tom@sorcery-rnbr45.wavecable.com)
[23:07] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'm not sure the degree to which I trust that this is a vacation for us, but here we are."
01[23:09] <03banana> 6KJ: "It's one of those things. We're leaving responsibilities behind, which is the same as shirking them." KJ thinks of the email sitting behind a screensaver in her secure room, unsent. She watches the platform for the coming train.
[23:10] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Oh, we don't leave anything behind. Not anymore. That's not the kind of job this is."
[23:10] <03Crion|> 4He sighs. "Hopefully the neighborhood won't explode while we're out."
01[23:11] <03banana> 6KJ: "Do you know anything fun to do in San Diego?" 
01[23:12] <03banana> 6The ghoul Essos fades into the foreground. While she's standing still it's hard to pick her out from the potted plants that line the inner wall of the old station.
[23:12] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I always wanted to catch a baseball game at PetCo Park, but I think that possibility's been rather firmly removed from the list of options."
[23:12] <03Quaker> As the three barons’ staffs mingle, waiting for the conductor to call all aboard, KJ sees someone through the window of a nearby cafe, sitting on a bench inside, waiting. Presbyter Vincent technically administers this territory for the Church, but her offices aren’t in San Juan Capistrano. Is she waiting for someone? Or taking a train? Either way, she’s taken pains to not be seen on the platform. 
[23:12] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "San Diego's not really a nightlife city."
[23:13] <03Crion|> "From my understanding, at least."
01[23:14] <03banana> 6KJ: "For a couple of weeks, it will be. If you're as good as I am." 6Or if Wilson is, but that seems unlikely.
[23:15] <03Quaker> “All aboard!” They can hear the sudden whuff of the engines cycling up, and their few fellow passengers start lining up and stepping in. As they do, every ghoul’s phone buzzes with an email notification. 
01[23:15] <03banana> 6She doesn't draw any attention to the priest, but makes sure to stand somewhere where Clara Vincent can see her - deliberately enough that a watcher watching themselves watched will be aware of the watched's watch. It's arguably a form of respect.
[23:16] <03Quaker> Clarabelle waves when she sees KJ seeing her. 
[23:16] <03Quaker> Rush and Buchanan both dutifully forward it to Cav; it’s from the Seneschal. 
[23:17] <03Crion|> 4Cav follows KJ's eye line back to the Presbyter, and when she waves, Cav will nod in her direction and smile. To KJ, without looking away from Vincent: "Ah. The church will be joining us after all."
[23:17] <03Quaker> RE: Travel
01[23:17] <03banana> 6Oh, it's the really friendly one. Might as well smile back and hope nobody mentioned that she's never got around to going to the Carmelite church despite all the invitations.
[23:17] <03Crion|> 4Cav glances at his phone.
01[23:18] <03banana> 6Zelda Essos doesn't need to forward anything to KJ - everything that hits her ghouls' inboxes is bounced to her own as a matter of course. Both women read it looking for things of quite different relevance.
[23:19] <03Quaker> To All Staffs: The Prince has left the city to attend to some urgent trade business abroad. This is not a license for any change in behavior or non-observance of established law. Any opportunists will be dealt with harshly. A formal message will be drafted shortly. The Prince is expected to return shortly. - Rosa Isaacs, Seneschal 
[23:20] <03Crion|> 4...?
[23:20] <03Crion|> 4Left the city? Abroad?
[23:20] <03Quaker> Clarabelle doesn’t join them, actually. Looks like she’s waiting for another train. 
[23:21] <03Crion|> 4Cav grimaces and resists the urge to shake his head. In New York no one would have known about something like this until after the Prince had returned. But then, the climate in New York is much different than it is in Los Angeles.
[23:21] <03Crion|> 4For instance, his last update on New York politics was Holymount's psuedo-sad notification that the other senior partners had been murdered while travelling.
[23:22] <03Quaker> With their belongings secured, the train blows its whistle and pulls out of the station. Within a few minutes, they’re clear of San Juan Capistrano and on the coastal track, the ocean on their right and the pitch-black foothills to their left. 
01[23:22] <03banana> 6KJ doesn't comment directly. "Have they got us sharing cabins? I'm in.. how do you read this thing.."
01[23:23] <03banana> "Seat BOF1. Or that might be the ticket number, and the seat number is something else. TBM?"
[23:24] <03Quaker> There’s hardly anyone else on the train with them at this time of night. The barons can sit pretty much wherever they like, once the conductors make their initial passes. 
[23:24] <03Crion|> 4The Amtrak that Cav is used to has general, self-selected seating with a quiet car in the front. But it depends if their benefactors have sprung for first class or not.
[23:25] <03Quaker> They have not. The quiet car is off-limits to coach passengers, sadly. There’s a website where they can use the Amtrak app to upgrade on the spot, but if you try to go on their website to download it, their servers appear to be down. 
[23:25] <03Crion|> 4Annoying.
[23:25] <03Crion|> 4Talking it is, then.
01[23:26] <03banana> 6Look, KJ wasn't sure whether to expect the bus-like BART style squalor or the freaking, orient express here? Anyway. An empty train is a much safer place to say: "'Abroad' could totally mean San Diego. Or this could be a distraction from that."
[23:26] <03Quaker> The train softly trundles down the coast track. They can see the San Clemente Pier now, the track running just behind the public beach. 
[23:27] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGpsKIDd4kg&t=230s
[23:27] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'm predisposed to worry about leaving the city empty like this."
[23:28] <03Crion|> 4Not because of foreign invaders, mind. But because it's doubtful the secret police will be joining them on this excursion.
[23:28] <03Crion|> 4Just more room for Burne and/or Bren to operate without supervision.
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: "It'll be fine. I've had a general sense of events spiralling out of control for a while - since meeting you, actually - and at some point fatalism sets in."
[23:31] <03Quaker> The two massive, concrete domes of the San Onofre nuclear station appear out of the darkness, silhouetted against the water. They’ll be out of home territory in a few minutes’ time. 
[23:31] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "That sounds like...the opposite of fine."
[23:31] <03Crion|> 4He glances out the window at San Onofre. Ah, memories.
01[23:31] <03banana> 6KJ: "I mean, fine in the sense that you can't do anything about it. Here's how to deal with interesting times like these:"
01[23:32] <03banana> "You set aside your long term plans - whatever you're trying to do with Laguna Beach, your soul thing(?), etc. Make sure that you trust yourself to deal with situations as they come! Stay fit, which is easy in our case, and watch the area juust around you."
01[23:33] <03banana> "Then just.. ride it. This should actually be a surfing analogy, but I've never learned."
[23:33] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yeah, well. You might have noticed that the 'area just around me' has gotten significantly more important than I think either of us are comfortable with recently."
01[23:34] <03banana> 6KJ: "Didn't you go through a special training program to be the center of attention?"
[23:34] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I've been surfing for quite awhile. Fun thing to note about it: you tend to fall off the board a lot."
[23:34] <03Crion|> 4He grimaces. "Yes. And I've still not had cause to use it."
01[23:35] <03banana> 6KJ leans back and squints.
01[23:35] <03banana> "This is when you aren't trying?"
[23:36] <03Crion|> "Pretty scary, huh?"
01[23:38] <03banana> 6Kind of. But let's not feed Cavanaugh's ego anymore. "Then this vacation is like, super good. OK. What do you like to do for fun in another city when there are literally no stakes?"
[23:38] <03Quaker> They’ve passed the last lights of Orange County. The hills and the ocean are both lightless out here. 
01[23:38] <03banana> "The only plans I've got are like.. drink blood, minigolf, visit the aquarium without a war on."
01[23:38] <03banana> "It might be nice to see Tijuana."
[23:39] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Hah. Stakes."
[23:39] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I'm gonna do some night surfing."
[23:39] <03Crion|> "One of the benefits of being able to see in the dark."
[23:40] <03Crion|> "Wonder if this 'princess' of Baron Modjeska's got property on the beachfront?"
01[23:40] <03banana> "Oh, wow. Are the waves different at night?" 6The knowledge that they've got no reception for a while keeps KJ from getting her phone out. It should be an opportunity to relax.
[23:41] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "You know, honestly, I'm not sure. I didn't pick it up until I came out here."
[23:42] <03Crion|> "Can't say it should matter too much day or night, though. It's all based on the tides."
01[23:42] <03banana> 6KJ: "Right, no surf on the Least Coast. How much time did you have to put into it?"
01[23:42] <03banana> 6Because while it WOULD be fun to pick up a board, about 110% of KJ's hours are spoken for generally.
[23:42] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I put aside three nights a week, less any other...social obligations I have that overlap with it."
01[23:43] <03banana> "Oh."
[23:43] <03Crion|> "I've had less time than usual recently."
[23:43] <03Crion|> "But we're somewhat out of season as it is." 4It's what, late April?
[23:43] <03Quaker> The doors to the car open for the snack trolley making the rounds. 
[23:43] <03Quaker> Let’s say it’s early summer by this point. 
01[23:44] <03banana> "Good job keeping track! Most of the Counts don't anymore." 6Fuck it, KJ gets her phone out. She's not ignoring Cav or anything, but it feels so.. uncomfortable to not be multitasking.
01[23:45] <03banana> "'Hold my avocado'? Come the fuck on."
[23:45] <03Crion|> 4Cav will treat himself to something from the snack cart. He is always Blushing now, and after all, this is supposed to be vacation.
[23:45] <03Quaker> What’s she even doing on her phone? There’s no reception out here. 
[23:46] <03Quaker> Their blueberry muffins are, surprisingly, extremely good. 
01[23:46] <03banana> 6Scrolling through what's loaded on her timelines, switching apps, flipping past those, switching back, refreshing in the hope of reception, scrolling up again, 
[23:47] <03Crion|> "What's this about avocado?"
[23:47] <03Crion|> 4He's nursed a very mild avocado addiction since regularly eating became a thing for him again.
01[23:47] <03banana> 6Eventually, Bubble Witch Saga. "Time Magazine. Millenials. We've ruined everything again."
[23:48] <03Crion|> "Well, fair enough."
01[23:49] <03banana> "I think they say 'millennials' like some sneering elder says 'neonates', you know? Beings whose very vital essence is puny, yet innately threatening."
[23:50] <03Crion|> 4The muffins ARE good. "If the analogy holds, they also can't stop talking about them while insisting they don't matter in the slightest."
[23:51] <03Quaker> Eventually, the lights appear again as they pass through Oceanside, then Carlsbad. At least they didn’t see any werewolves. 
[23:52] <03Crion|> 4If we'd reached the point where werewolves were running up on Amtrak cars, even in the dead of night, even with vampires in them, that would be cause for...significant concern.
01[23:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "That is extremely correct. Four years of it was bad enough, I feel for the people who stay shitty for fifty."
01[23:52] <03banana> "World's oldest millennials. Returning to torpor every generation to de-age from a conservative uncle into a fun uncle into a nerd uncle."
[23:53] <03Quaker> Well, it’s like a safari. You might see some wild animals in the distance. 
[23:54] <03Crion|> 4Cav resists the urge to talk politics. As a New Yorker involved with tacky rich people and finance, he's had more than enough of the current Republican frontrunner for three lifetimes.
01[23:56] <03banana> "Hey, how and why are you modifying your own soul?"
[23:57] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "The 'how' is a trade secret."
[23:58] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "The 'why'...well, you'd understand better if you'd met me sooner."
01[23:58] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm more interested in the other one. Is it like.. a self-esteem thing?"
[23:58] <03Crion|> "Hah."
[23:58] <03Crion|> "No. It's not a self-esteem thing."
01[23:58] <03banana> "Honestly, you seem like an okay dude. I'm not just saying that."
01[23:58] <03banana> 6KJ: "We've got a lot of Types in L.A. and the main type is 'bad'."
[23:59] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I've spent most of the last three years angry enough to kill people."
Session Time: Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03Crion|> "I've gotten into a number of fights -- above and beyond the fights people like us normally get into -- and those fights had consequences."
01[00:01] <03banana> 6KJ's quiet for a moment. "That is some weight to carry. Are you making yourself forget, let go?"
[00:02] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Forget? No. Let go? Well, we'll see."
01[00:03] <03banana> 6KJ's pulled up one of the oldest images on her phone. She holds it out to Cav- "Check this out."
[00:03] <03Crion|> "Anyway, the last time I underwent the sort of...elective therapy...this path requires, I met what I believe is a personification of my anger, which I belive threatened to kill me."
[00:04] <03Crion|> 4He'll take the phone if it's handed to him.
01[00:06] <03banana> http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd2-633.gif 6It's some sort of diagram with a lot of arcane terms about the spirit. A weird mix of egyptian and hebrew stuff.
03[00:07] * Joins: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-opg.5pj.172.73.IP)
01[00:07] <03banana> 6KJ: "This sounds familiar to something a cult indoctrinated me with once. The reification of your alternate self, projecting a soul-image which can in turn affect the world."
01[00:07] <03banana> "Or in your case.. be affected by the world?"
[00:08] <03Quaker> They’ve just passed Encinitas. Have either of them been this south before? 
01[00:08] <03banana> 6She's placed the cult's own teachings in that image, of course, to show Cavanaugh again his successes at whatever this mystical thing is, to make him want to talk.. the iPhone has an aura of mystery and an aura of exaltation.
[00:08] <03Crion|> 4Cav glances at it, phone in hand, and for a brief moment his mind goes back to the night he first figured out the theory behind autodidacticism. With a lot of help, of course, but that was the first time he'd ever had a real breakthrough in his own research.
01[00:08] <03banana> 6Which isn't just Apple marketing.
[00:09] <03Crion|> "Wow. Yeah." 4Cav grins as he looks down at it, somewhere far away for an instant, before handing the phone back.
[00:09] <03Crion|> 4Depends whether or not they're further south than that office building Cav helped storm during the war.
01[00:10] <03banana> 6KJ: "The motion between Cheybi and Chayah was meant to be the 'higher self walking in the world', the thing that was you and could improve you. Did you get to defeat your anger peacefully?
[00:14] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yes and no. I did what I had to do before it had a chance to stop me, and then it quoted poetry at me and ran off."
[00:16] <03Quaker> The lights are growing brighter. They must be passing through the suburbs north of the city proper. 
01[00:17] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's fascinating. 'The vehicle of the higher soul will prove itself by compelling the baser self to retreat' - Blavatsky by way of the Latitude. If there was even a kernel of truth in those teachings, it sounds like you were in the opposite position- casting yourself as the super-ego, the being in control of yourselves. What did that take?"
01[00:17] <03banana> 6Strange light as the conversation becomes stranger.
[00:18] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Like I said. Trade secrets."
[00:18] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "...wasn't what I expected, though."
01[00:21] <03banana> 6KJ: "Well, the Shepherds can hardly have prepared you for what you found here." 6That's not quite a wild guess - she's read the Shepherd communications and they are boring as fuck. Movements of blood and herds in the language of finance - 'human resources' needing no actual transliteration. 'Chrysalis' is something native to this city.
[00:22] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "The Shepherds prepared me for a politics that is...significantly different than the kind Los Angeles deals in."
[00:22] <03Crion|> "In that politics, being angry all the time is both a successful tactic and an unavoidable outcome."
01[00:23] <03banana> 6KJ: "How can you even tell what kind we deal in here? There's so much under the surface. I'm only beginning to see it now, after I thought i'd played the game well enough to win a ticket in."
01[00:24] <03banana> 6It's a damn shame that he's not actually stupid.
[00:26] <03Quaker> If they look to their right, they can see the land suddenly give way to a huge series of bays and inlets, and in the distance, the lights of SeaWorld. 
[00:27] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "LA politics are no less dangerous, but they are less vicious."
[00:27] <03Crion|> "Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing."
[00:28] <03Crion|> "Seems like there's a lot of violent urges that get sublimated." 4He learned that word recently, too.
[00:28] <03Crion|> "So then you get people in plate armor jumping out of helicopters, and so on."
01[00:28] <03banana> "Uh." 6Oh, wait, he's not talking about her. "Well, that's not very deep sublimation is it?"
[00:29] <03Crion|> "Depends on how violent you really are."
[00:29] <03Crion|> "And how violent you really wish you could be."
[00:29] <03Crion|> 4He sighs. "I'm just glad the Wilderness Commission didn't shoot up my office. Insane pricks."
01[00:30] <03banana> 6SeaWorld.. this time without bombs, KJ hopes. "Well, maybe more of the Invictus should be undergoing elective therapy."
[00:31] <03Crion|> 4Cav's pretty sure she won't pass that insult along to Count Ma. Much more sure than he would've been back east.
[00:31] <03Crion|> 4He smiles slightly. "What, and take away the one thing that makes me stand out from my co-workers?"
01[00:32] <03banana> 6You can count on KJ Valentine to not give out information, any day of the week.
01[00:32] <03banana> 6Night.
[00:32] <03Crion|> 4Cav glances out the window. "SeaWorld."
[00:33] <03Crion|> "Why do I remember SeaWorld? Did something happen there?"
01[00:33] <03banana> 6Yeah! "I wish they still had orcas. But I'm still going."
01[00:33] <03banana> "Something.. well, yes."
[00:34] <03Crion|> "Let me know when you go. Maybe I'll join you, if they haven't lied to us about this being a vacation and I'm not tied down with work."
01[00:37] <03banana> "Sure. Got to get that nightlife started somewhere." 6And we do need to find out whether this is real work.
[00:38] <03Quaker> Well, they’ll see what it is in any case in a moment. The engineer announces their next stop, San Diego’s Old Town Station, coming up in a few minutes. Prepare to disembark! 
[00:39] <03Crion|> 4Cav stands and grabs his carry-on. That was a fun little jaunt.
[00:39] <03Quaker> What have they heard about San Diego’s court, anyway? 
[00:39] <03Crion|> 4They're not fans of being thrown out of office buildings.
[00:39] <03Crion|> 4That's Cav's main impression.
01[00:40] <03banana> 6The Invictus and the Lancea Sanctum are unified under a banner of tradition. They have strong ties to the south. They were the ones who 'settled' L.A. originally. 
01[00:40] <03banana> 6KJ doesn't know whether to expect people who speak mostly Spanish or refuse it entirely. That's the main reason she brought Essos, as a translator.
[00:41] <03Crion|> 4He's also vaguely aware that the San Diego court are the people who facilitated the church hunters who came up into LA from Mexico last year.
[00:41] <03Crion|> 4Which eventually kicked off the war, if he recalls correctly.
[00:47] <03Quaker> The train slows to a halt. Through the windows, they can see that they’ve stopped next to a squat beige building with a brown roof. OLD TOWN TRANSIT CENTER, reads the sign. A bit beyond, there’s more buildings, with a warm glow of light distinct from the concrete and parking lots around them. They can see bits of spanish tile and glimpses of adobe. 
01[00:51] <03banana> 6That's kind of pretty. KJ and her ghoul head to the door. They take a a leisurely (ha) pace, since there's no crowd to shove past.. Amtrak ended up a lot more comfortable than she expected.
[00:52] <03Quaker> The ride here must have relaxed Cav more than he realized. He doesn’t realize there’s a crowd of about two dozen people standing on the platform outside until he’s waiting behind KJ in the aisle. They seem to be waiting for them, specifically. They can tell, because no other passengers except the barons and their staff are disembarking here. 
[00:52] <03Crion|> 4Uh.
[00:53] <03Crion|> 4That's a...large delegation.
[00:53] <03Crion|> 4He makes sure to link back up with Rush and Buchanon.
01[00:53] <03banana> 6Are there any familiar faces here, because there's like eight of us total
[00:54] <03Quaker> Buchanan is on his phone. Rush is trying to look down at the platform through the windows. 
[00:54] <03Crion|> 4Cav realizes that he's never seen either KJ or Wilson fight before.
[00:54] <03Crion|> 4Hopefully that won't change on this platform.
[00:55] <03Quaker> Sure! KJ sees Abigail Gannon, who she’s met at parties before. She’s, uh, dressed differently than her usual fashionable club attire. 
[00:57] <03Quaker> Anyway, time to get off, if they’re getting off. 
[00:58] <03Crion|> 4Cav will take the lead.
[00:58] <03Crion|> 4If people are going to throw hands, he should be in the front anyway.
01[01:00] <03banana> 6Oh, will he?
01[01:01] <03banana> 6KJ's going to share that spotlight even if it takes Celerity. Apparently nobody knows what they're dealing with here.
[01:01] <03Quaker> As they step down, the two dozen people stiffen, prepare, and- 
[01:01] <03Quaker> Someone’s arm falls in a signal. 
[01:01] <03Quaker> Suddenly, the platform explodes in noise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w4BH7Ix_NI
[01:01] <03Crion|> 4Oh god.
01[01:02] <03banana> 6:D
[01:03] <03Quaker> People hurry forward to put specially embroidered sombreros on the barons as the huge mariachi band plays enthusiastically for them. Sparklers have been placed at a tasteful (very far away) distance to try to add non-stressfully to the occasion. Someone hands a bouquet of flowers to KJ. 
[01:03] <03Crion|> 4His impulse to roll his eyes at KJ scampering and shouldering up next to him is immediately replaced with a flash of startlement, then slight embarrassment.
[01:03] <03Crion|> 4Briefly and nonsensically, he worries if this is some kind of Masquerade violation.
01[01:05] <03banana> 6Baron Valentine nods to the mariachi, takes the flowers and sticks the brightest in her suit pocket. She's gladhanding and blowing kisses like they've got a red carpet, which perhaps they literally do
[01:06] <03Quaker> They can both see Ambassador Gannon shoo away a courtier holding a pair of white porcelain masks on a satin pillow. “Not here,” she says, exasperated. 
[01:07] <03Crion|> 4None of this shows on his face, which breaks out in an easy smile as he moves forward to meet and greet the San Diego delegation. If the vampires here are speaking Spanish, he will too.
01[01:09] <03banana> "Lo siento mucho, pero mi español es malo. We're very happy to be wherever we are."
[01:09] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Ambassador Gannon."
[01:10] <03Quaker> Then, she turns back to them, smiling. The last time KJ saw her, she was ready to club. Now, she’s dressed in a long black skirt, with a white and blue rebozo wrapped around her shoulders, a huge blue flower in her hair. “Welcome, Barons! So good to see you. I hope your travels weren’t too stressful.” Her deep southern accent feels a bit out of place here, but her friendly demeanor goes a long way to explain why she was 
[01:10] <03Quaker> picked for the position. 
[01:11] <03Quaker> There isn’t a San Diego delegation, actually. As they get their bearings, they realize it’s just the ambassador and a few assistants. 
01[01:12] <03banana> "It was peaceful as all get-out, Ambassador! We're relaxed enough to assume any diplomatic duty you care to name. Cares left behind in the big city."
[01:13] <03Quaker> And the paid mariachis, who plays gamely on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKEm19lMjuQ
[01:13] <03Crion|> 4Well. Interesting.
[01:14] <03Crion|> 4To the ambassador: "The train was nice. Relaxing."
[01:15] <03Quaker> Abby waves KJ off. “Oh, no, don’t worry about all that yet. I’ll make sure you’re settled in at the table before I put anything on your plate. Where are you all staying?” 
[01:16] <03Crion|> 4Cav will have booked a nice but not extravagant set of rooms at one of the best hotels in the city. Three in total, one for him and each of his ghouls.

[01:17] <03Crion|> 4Still, Buchanon has the hotel reservations ready to file if things get weird.

[01:20] <03Quaker> The Ambassador shakes her head. “No, nevermind, I’m just being a party pooper. Better you three safe and sound with the Princess than me having to worry about you all the time. Anyway…”

[01:21] <03Quaker> “Oh, it’s wonderful! You know, KJ, you would hate it in the long-term, but I’ve fallen in love. Feels like a small town, with all the big city amenities. Just don’t tell them I said that,” she says, winking. 
[01:22] <03Quaker> “On which front, Baron?”

[01:28] <03Crion|> 4Hard to tell precisely what the ambassador's problem with the princess is. 'Good' news is that usually when someone is uneasy but polite about a landed elder he hasn't met, the matter clears itself up very quickly, because the elder walks around in full plate mail or advocates for burning the forests down to drive the witches into the sea.
[01:28] <03Quaker> “Work for a pittance, too. Well, look, I don’t want to do much to weigh you down with my responsibilities. You’re here for a vacation, aren’t you? Here’s all I need you to do. Once you’re all settled in and you’ve spent a night or two relaxing, come see me and I’ll get you up to speed. The signing gala isn’t for another three days, anyway.” 
01[01:32] <03banana> 6KJ: "We're here as your resources, Abby. We'll be holidaying as long as you don't need us- but if you do, don't hesitate. Please!"
[01:34] <03Quaker> “Just a few recommendations before you go, though. Please, please stick together while you’re out. Things are better than they were, feelings-wise. But they’re not totally peachy keen on us, you know? Especially - and KJ, you know I don’t mean this about you and yours, or yours, Baron, obviously - especially when you’re being a royal asshole. Which…” She huffs. “Some people are just not suited for diplomatic work
[01:34] <03Quaker> I’ve had to send some people home. How they got down here, I can’t imagine.” 
[01:34] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I concur. I can't spend the entire time surfing."
[01:34] <03Quaker> “Just don’t jump down any rabbit holes, is all I’m asking.” 
[01:35] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Ah, being a royal asshole. The Invictus prerogative. I'll aspire to the former, not the latter."
01[01:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "Same. We'll politely defer to local interests and make friends if we even make waves."
01[01:35] <03banana> "Can I ask you one thing, though? As the Ambassador to San Diego."
[01:35] <03Quaker> “Thank you, Baron. I know the Prince has picked a better batch this time around. Now, the, um…” She looks around. Where has Wilson gotten to? “Hm? What’s that, KJ?” 
01[01:37] <03banana> "Well, the Court chose to send Barons who - between us - accounted for at least fifteen dead on the other side. Are you sure it's all good for now?"
[01:38] <03Crion|> 4Cav isn't quite sure how...public his activities during the war are, even now, to the ambassador.
[01:39] <03Crion|> "Yes, it's my hope not to run into someone I recognize on the street," 4is all he'll say on that front unprompted.
01[01:39] <03banana> 6KJ's watching for his reaction as well as Abby's, of course. But it's a real question too.
[01:41] <03Quaker> Abby waves a hand. “Oh, that. No, don’t worry about it. Honestly, it’s the whole San Diego thing, you know. You’re doing them a favor, really, dying in glorious battle, you know. They won’t say it, but some of these elders like portraits of dead children more than the living thing. As long as you did it wearing armor, face to face, I can’t imagine they’ll try anything. Now, they might give you a nasty look or two. 
[01:41] <03Quaker> But all’s fair in love and war, etcetera…”

[01:41] <03Crion|> 4Haha. Yeah. Wearing armor.
[01:42] <03Crion|> 4Well, it was face-to-face at least.
[01:42] <03Crion|> 4Claw-to-face.
01[01:42] <03banana> 6Great! Wilson should be fine, then. "It's nice to have all that behind us. What's the best way to get around the city tonight?"
[01:45] <03Quaker> Abby: “Now, I was in San Francisco at the time, so I guess the principle only goes so far - oh, well, I’m sure the Princess has a spare driver for you. If you want to stretch your legs on your own, we’ve got our own exclusive cab contract. I’ll send you the number. Service all hours, anywhere in the county. Tip well, though. They drive faster that way. The trolleys are cute little things, but it’s only around downtown.
[01:45] <03Quaker> Plus, you know what a pain in the ass sticking to a schedule is, especially when you just want to relax.” 
[01:47] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Indeed." 4He still hasn't installed Uber, mainly out of petulance -- it feels like a full third of the e-mails on the Shepherds listserv are various complaints about NYC cabs, and pining for Uber to replace them permanently -- and is glad he still doesn't have to even without his Lexus.
[01:47] <03Quaker> True to Abby’s prediction, they can see a fully-uniformed chaffeur, brass buttons running down the front of his jacket, waiting at a respectful distance for them. 
01[01:48] <03banana> 6Let's grab a spare serape for him.
[01:51] <03Quaker> Abby: “Now. The last thing I need to talk to you about.” 
[01:51] <03Quaker> She definitely looks uncomfortable. 
[01:51] <03Crion|> 4Here it comes.
01[01:51] <03banana> 6KJ: "Oh, I knew it was going to get real at some point. Go ahead."
[01:52] <03Quaker> “I don’t see Baron Frost around. He’s in your party, though?” 
[01:54] <03Quaker> She looks around for him. “But besides that…how many other Nosferatu are with you?” 
[01:55] <03Crion|> "It's just the Baron Hollywood, I believe. But they come and go. You know how Obfuscate can be."
[01:58] <03Quaker> Abby shakes her head. “Damn local customs. Funny thing about our little social circle. You get so used to complaining about how Marquis Figueroa is, or how stuffy all our sires can be, and you forget that they’re the ones with enough foresight to leave places like this and try new things.” She waves her aide forward. He comes, bringing a suitcase. 
[01:59] <03Quaker> “Now, understand, I think it’s a barbaric custom. But you may want to observe them for your own safety and comfort.” The aide opens the suitcase. Inside, are the two white, featureless, porcelain masks, on a red silk pillow.

[08:24] <03Ferrinus> 12Well, the Squared Circle is now gainfully employed.
[08:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10You make it sound so tawdry.
[08:25] <03Crion_> 4The cool thing about being the enforcer is you just have to stand around looking threatening.
[08:27] <03trenchfoot> 13I'm the cleaner!
[08:27] <03Ferrinus> 12In the guise of a pack of deathly weirdos, they've earned the trust (and contract-mediated supernatural coercion) of Brueghel, the Evening Master. They're now meant to deploy their somewhat ambiguous but definitely superhuman capabilities in service of public complacency. Specifically, there's a region in the undercity that needs to be purged of plague...
[08:29] <03Ferrinus> 12It seems that's meant to have been dealt with within the next two days. Also coming up is Ir's fight with a pair of tyrant lizards. Otherwise, the city ticks along - refugees flood in, agreements fail to be reached on the topic of the Confederacy's acceptance of rejection of Thorns, the Guild continues to flail about and grasp for help in all directions.
[08:31] <03Ferrinus> 12Rumor ripples through the city, of cloaked Council operatives searching back-alleys and safehouses for fugitives, of diplomatic tensions with Lookshy, of some disaster to the east...
[08:34] <03Crion_> 4Ir, meanwhile, is getting ready for this arena bout.
[08:34] <03Crion_> 4Tyrant lizards, huh. She's never faced off with one of them, let alone two.
[08:35] <03Ferrinus> 12She's fought stuff of similar size, at least.
[08:36] <03Crion_> 4Either way, not a good time to be mucking around with her new wrestling techniques. It'll be Iscariot and her golden plate.
[08:42] <03Ferrinus> 12Anyway, Qasha, one of the two outcaste dragon-blooded who serve as Brueghel's adjutants, has given you specific directions. You're looking for one of the higher blocks of the southwestern undercity - a tightly-packed tenement built into the side of a cavern and all along the shelf of stone jutting out from it. It's fed by rivulets of water branching off from the Grey River and lit 
[08:42] <03Ferrinus> 12by a combination of torches and fungus.
[08:43] <03dammitwho> 7How aesthetic.
[08:43] <03Ferrinus> 12a e s t h e t i c s
[08:46] <03Crion_> 4Last Westerly Star, however, is in the undercity, working security for...what are we calling this venture again?
[08:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Death's Notaries, obviously.
[08:53] <03Crion_> 4Star's not quite clear on what a 'notary' is, but it sounds cool.
[08:53] <03dammitwho> "I was already a notary." 7Blossom says idly.
[08:53] <03Crion_> 4Oh.
[08:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "But were you a notary... of death?"
[08:54] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What would that even be?"
[08:54] <03Crion_> 4Ir: "You write death...notes?"
[08:54] <03@VoxPVoxD> "See? These are exactly the kinds of questions we want people asking!"
[08:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's swishing a stick around, polished wood painted black with the balance and gentle arc of a slashing sword. Still wearing the cape, obviously.
[08:55] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Wait, are we notaries OF death, or notaries FOR death?"
[08:56] <03Crion_> 4Ir: "Is there a difference?"
[08:57] <03Ferrinus> 12It's a winding slope that leads up to the neighborhood, which you learn from the signage and the mutterings of locals is called the High Hollow. The naming's a bit ironic, given that Hollow is the proper name of the First Age city on whose ruins Nexus is built - these people probably just referred to the fact that the neighborhood's piled into a cavern that's been cut out of the 
[08:57] <03Ferrinus> 12bedrock by some force or other. It's a little unusual for the Undercity, most of which is built on old sewer infrastructure rather than natural stone.
[08:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Hollow was kind of a weird name for a city in the first place. You gotta wonder what they were thinking.
[09:01] <03Ferrinus> 12At any rate, it's quite crowded - not because there are a lot of people there, but because the wood buildings there are tightly clustered and leave very little room for passers by. It's basically unavoidable that you have to jostle, although the people here are tightly cloaked and generally keep their eyes to the ground.
[09:01] <03Ferrinus> 12Do the Notaries announce themselves and demand information or slip stealthily about or what?
[09:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10We aren't really set up to be sneaky. One of us is a giant bird.
[09:03] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys Violetta can be exceptionally sneaky, thank you. She's just. Not, right now.
[09:03] <03Ferrinus> 12Well, with your demeanors, people are quick to avoid you. Doors close, figures take turns down alleyways rather than pass by, and such.
[09:04] <03Crion_> 4Last Westerly Star is slinking, but not particularly sneakily.
[09:12] <03dammitwho> 7Probably a lot of thieves and ne'er-do-wells here. It's good that they avoid us.
[09:13] <03Ferrinus> 12Tatsuya could tell you that there are, in fact. Not that there's anything to steal, but there are a few places to store stuff or move it around.
[09:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend drags his wooden sword across the gap-toothed panels of the undercity shacks like a child hitting fenceposts with a stick. At some point, someone sticks their head out of a door to find out who's making that racket, and comes face to face with a tall man in a tall hat, hiding behind a white mask and a billowing cape. "Friend!" 10He extends his free right hand. "I'm Friend. 
[09:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> Talk to me."
[09:17] <03Crion_> 4Star stands well back but clearly in sight, hands on their hips, eyes staring out from behind the mask.
[09:17] <03Ferrinus> 12A pale figure wrapped in a shawl recoils and moves to slam their door shut again, but Friend's blade is in the way. "What do you - I've paid!"
[09:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys tilts her masked head slightly. Curious. Who's running a racket down here?
[09:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A sick pale figure in a shawl? "Be cheerful, sir. We come not to take but to give. We are angels of health."
[09:23] <03Ferrinus> 12They do look sick, but Eikichi and Ying would mark it as syphilis rather than some kind of mysterious death-plague. "That so? Always been nice and-" 12(cough) "-healthy up here in the hollow. ...been..."
[09:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ah. Friend says the magic words: "We've already been paid. We really are just here to help."
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10If this guy doesn't have anything to say, there's a lot more houses to hit with sticks. Friend keeps at it until somebody talks.
[09:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What do they say?
[09:27] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys, quietly: "Payment..." 13The mask should keep her voice from carrying beyond the circle. "Changed times. Should be neutral ground."
[09:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "?"
[09:30] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys Violetta, Midnight's Darling: "Storehouses. Fronts. Hideouts. Vaults. No point in shaking these places down when they might just be another gang's property already. Something's changed."
[09:30] <03Ferrinus> 12This guy's healthy as he's ever been, he'll tell you. And he's paid, he'll tell you. Once he's assured that this isn't the leadup to some kind of really strange intimidation tactic, though, he lets slip a few things - like that the neighbor across from his resonance took ill a few days back and hasn't been seen since, and that the one place to eat in the entire neighborhood has 
[09:30] <03Ferrinus> 12closed for unspecified reasons, and that there've been more bodies floating down the channels out of the neighborhood than usual.
[09:32] <03Crion_> 4Star, meanwhile, is keeping their eyes open. Remote place. Real out of the way. That's very good for them, and the people who'd think they could take them would think similarly.
[09:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend, to Dexys: "Foodborne maybe? Should check the diner and the corpses."
[09:33] <03Ferrinus> 12That last bit might trigger a few frowns beneath your assorted masks. It means that you're going to have to search downstream of this place to make sure no contaminants have ranged far from the neighborhood.
[09:34] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "The diner is our best lead, it looks like."
[09:35] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "There first, then downriver."
[09:37] <03Ferrinus> 12As Friend-of-the-Far-Side interrogates more people, patterns emerge; that one restaurant (believed to be involved in shady dealings of some sort), has been closed down for days, and a smattering of people have simply vanished of late (and probably more than is known, since it's a neighborhood already hosting a lot of recluses and weirdos). You've got a small list of apartments and 
[09:37] <03Ferrinus> 12hidey-holes to check, as well as directions to the mushroom stir-fry spot itself.
[09:39] <03trenchfoot> 13She amends. "There first, then the surroundings, then downriver."
[09:40] <03Crion_> 4Star will start heading over to the restaurant, unless someone else wants an escort. 'Mysteriously shut down eatery' is a top three evil lurking spot where they come from.
[09:40] <03Crion_> 4There was this gelato shop in Pneuma--
[09:41] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "This is what I was talking about, with public health workers being overwhelmed."
[09:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend looks at Princess, who probably can't read his face behind his mask. "...yeah."
[09:42] <03Ferrinus> 12You arrive at a shuttered and boarded-up building boxed in on all sides by the piled-up dwellings of other high hollow residents. How loudly and insistently are you willing to bang on the front door?
[09:43] <03Crion_> 4Star is killing to kick the thing down if need be.
[09:43] <03Crion_> *4willing
[09:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How does the place smell?
[09:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Also, how far are we from the nearest running water?
[09:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Or standing water, for that matter.
[09:45] <03Ferrinus> 12There's water running along the cavern roof over your heads, down the wall behind this place, and presumably into the rock it's standing on. All sorts of fungi are sprouting along its path, and yes, it's just sticking to the rock rather than dripping down on you.
[09:47] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess: "Those fungi can't be good for the residents of this district. This was inevitable."
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What kind of fungi are they?
[09:47] <03trenchfoot> 13Also, how long have they been here?
[09:48] <03Crion_> 4Star raises a hand to the door to knock, then pauses and steps back.
[09:48] <03Crion_> "Don't knock. Don't talk too loud."
[09:48] <03Crion_> "Before we go any further: weapons."
[09:48] <03Crion_> "Kruthik inside."
[09:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Kruthik!
[09:49] <03Ferrinus> 12Many are the glowing kind, which is what allows people to live in a place so dark AND so flammable in relative stability. Like I said, you're looking at a fungus stir-fry place; there are definitely a few of those you wouldn't want to eat, but surely they know.
[09:50] <03Crion_> 4Star snaps their fingers and Iscariot jumps from belt to hand. In this disguised form it looks like a staff -- except that one end is just slightly too pointed.
[09:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys Violetta needs no weapons. Her posture shifts slightly, but she remains unarmed.
[09:53] <03Ferrinus> 12There's some motion to your side, but it's just someone staring and then ducking out of sight when one of you produces a magic weapon.
[09:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend's wooden sword is sheathed.
[09:54] <03Crion_> 4Hh.
[09:54] <03Crion_> 4Star's ready to kick the door in when everyone's set.
[10:00] <03dammitwho> 7Ready.
[10:01] <03Crion_> 4Star's hips pivot and their right leg shoots out, crashing through the door with an immensely powerful follow-through. They hold the kick position for a moment, then swivel their hips back, curling their leg back in towards their body and lowering it back to the ground.
[10:02] <03Ferrinus> 12CRASH! "AH! FUCK!"
[10:03] <03Crion_> 4Ir might have apologized, or seemed worried that there was someone inside. Last Westerly Star is not.
[10:04] <03Crion_> 4And does not.
[10:04] <03Crion_> 4Instead, they stalk inside.
[10:04] <03Ferrinus> 12Star demolishes a door that turned out to have been barred and laden with a heavy table, sending splinters of wood scattering across the floor of a dim room. This must have been an easting area at one point - counters, seats, a more metal-heavy area in the back for cooking - but it's clearly been reconfigured for some sort of siege.
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They're not naked, are they? Friend hates it when that happens.
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh, whew.
[10:05] <03Ferrinus> 12A trio of figures, shrouded in the black and grey commonly worn in these parts, are worriedly raising knives and clubs while also backing away from you. Notably, behind them is a massive pile of junk and furniture.
[10:06] <03Ferrinus> 12There's definitely some sort of trap door under there, and a faint green light.
[10:07] <03Ferrinus> 12One of the three: "G-get out of here! This is Whisper territory!"
[10:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend, whispering: "Okay."
[10:08] <03Crion_> 4Star slowly cocks their head sideways at the three of them, the expressionless mask turning to face each of them in turn, and then slowly begins slipping sideways to let the talkers take point, while also flanking the three men.
[10:11] <03Ferrinus> 12That's not all - of these three people, two look unwell. Pale, sweaty, with the vitreous humor in their eyes far greener than it should be.
[10:11] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "Whispers? Was not aware they had territory." 13She quirks her head slightly. "Change in business?"
[10:11] <03dammitwho> "I don't think he meant that you should whisper."
[10:11] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Yeah, and this - up to them. Fuck out of here! We're holding it."
[10:12] <03Crion_> 4Star: "Kruthik." 4Their voice is gravelly but high-register at the same time; androgynous and hard to pin down.
[10:14] <03Ferrinus> 12They look at each other. "Who toldj-" "Shutupshutup!"
[10:15] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "Pointless." 13She speaks with scorn and disdain, palpable even through the metallic filter. "You are ill."
[10:16] <03Crion_> "Smell," 4said Star. "And you, now."
[10:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend gives them a dazzling smile, hands up in a gesture of peace. "My friends, we're not here to make your lives harder. Holed up here... fighting for your lives... getting sicker by the day... you don't need to suffer like this. You are not alone."
[10:19] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Y-... they sent you?"
[10:20] <03Ferrinus> 12Other man: "Then how come they didn't give the pa-"
[10:20] <03Ferrinus> 12First man: "Shut up!"
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend rights a stool from the outer barricade and sits on it. "I'm Friend. This is Princess, Star, and Dexys. Don't worry about who sent us - we've already been paid. All we want is to help."
[10:22] <03Ferrinus> 12The three are put at ease. Eventually, they resume their positions - one nearer the door, two others literally sitting on the mass of junk holding down the trapdoor in the floor.
[10:23] <03Crion_> 4Star is now crouching ominously on a table, positioned just so any of the three can see them out of the corners of their eyes while looking at Friend, Princess, and Dexys.
[10:24] <03Ferrinus> 12They explain: they were watching a shipment when something went wrong. They sent word for help but haven't heard back.
[10:25] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess: "What went wrong?"
[10:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "Something came up from underground, didn't it? Into the basement."
[10:26] <03Ferrinus> 12Cloaked, not-sick man: "Beats me. We were handling it all careful... didn't even know what it was. It just... burst, or something."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Handling what?"
[10:27] <03Ferrinus> 12They shrug helplessly. "Boxes."
[10:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "From who?"
[10:28] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "You don't get a lot of work if you ask that stuff."
[10:28] <03Crion_> 4Star: "The Kruthik came from the boxes." 4It isn't phrased as a question.
[10:29] <03Ferrinus> 12Man: "Well, the- I mean, probably-"
[10:30] <03Crion_> 4Star's voice is even, but not threatening. "Stop hedging."
[10:32] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys examines one of the two sick ones, but comes up with nothing useful. Do they complain of any symptons beyond looking very ill?
[10:32] <03Ferrinus> 12Intense staring and occasional prodding allows Star to extract an entire accounting from these men. They're working for the 'Whispers', a duct gang (it's like a street gang, but this is the undercity) that deals in secrets and occult goods and has become increasingly militant and organized in recent months. Specifically they were transporting what they were told were artifacts and 
[10:32] <03Ferrinus> 12persishable alchemical reagants from elsewhere in the city.
[10:34] <03Ferrinus> 12These things were sealed in boxes of mahogany inlaid with gold and were expressly meant to never be opened, exposed to heat, turned on their side or upside down, or even shaken particularly hard. As far as these guys know, those instructions were followed to the letter, so it came as a serious surprise when the secret storehouse kept in the basement of this restaurant just... exploded. 
[10:34] <03Ferrinus> 12Bloomed, one might say.
[10:35] <03Ferrinus> 12It melted a few people and started growing rapidly and these goons did their best to seal it up. Now, as they said, they're waiting for support - they sent out the call by breaking a jade slip they were supposed to, but didn't hear back. Whoever was supposed to take care of this left them hanging, unless you're them, which it doesn't sound like.
[10:36] <03Crion_> 4Star listens motionlessly and intently, then swivels their head to stare at Friend. "Purge the Kruthik, then?"
[10:41] <03dammitwho> "To start."
[10:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "The kruthik have probably absorbed whatever was already in the basement. We are going to have to burn this place to clean the infection... and probably bless it too."
[10:44] <03Crion_> 4Star: "That should get the attention of whomever has been lax in answering their talent."
[10:44] <03Crion_> "Good."
[10:44] <03Crion_> "We should...talk."
[10:44] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "Can you cure those two?" 7She gestures at the two men with greenish ichor tainting them.
[10:44] <03Ferrinus> 12And whoever else outside this building is infected... and any bodies that might've fallen in the waterways leading out of here... this might mean days of work.
[10:44] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys remains silent and looks to Friend.
[10:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "Oh, yeah, definitely. Especially with Princess's help."
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll need some slightly esoteric supplies, but I'm sure we can get those."
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "And you'll have to be asleep for most of a day."
[10:48] <03Crion_> 4Star: "We will need a clinic."
[10:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, nobody's going to be eating here for a while. Once we've sanitized the space we can pitch a tent here. No need for a quarantine once the source is purged."
[10:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "At least... not a quarantine here."
[10:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We're also going to need to follow those corpses down the canals. Each one is another potential outbreak."
[10:51] <03Crion_> "True. But first things first." 4Star's head turns to consider the junk pile and the two men sitting on it again. "The Kruthik."
[10:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "True..."
[10:52] <03Ferrinus> 12One of them: "What're- what're you gonna do about it? I don't even know what's down there."
[10:52] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "Best not to know."
[10:53] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess: "Cheer up! There won't be anything down there soon."
[10:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend, very seriously: "Do you really want to know?"
[10:55] <03Ferrinus> 12He goggles at you. "J-just that you'll win."
[10:55] <03trenchfoot> 13She leans uncomfortably close to the one that asked. "Less known, less to confess to later. Something to think about."
[10:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend beams: "We always win."
[10:55] <03Ferrinus> 12They back away, one by one.
[11:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend unhooks his sword from his belt, proffering it to the healthy Whisper. "Hold this for me, would you?"
[11:01] <03Ferrinus> "Uh..." 12He takes it, uncertain.
[11:02] <03Ferrinus> "This one-a them Immortal Murderin' swords?"
[11:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Thank you. Back in a bit!" 10Away we go~
[11:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10On the way down: "I'll let you know, next time I meet an Immortal."
[11:02] <03Crion_> 4Star slinks off the table and follows them down.
[11:05] <03Ferrinus> 12It's a few minutes' work to shove the pile of clutter off of the trap door, which the three men won't help you do unless you make them. They find counters to hide behind as you open the thing up, causing a toxic green light to spill upwards out of the square hole in the floor and catch on the opposing ceiling.
[11:05] <03Ferrinus> 12Nothing comes leaping up, but there is a plume of rising vapor. Only one of you's fitting through at a time - Friend's first?
[11:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That'd be foolish. But yes.
[11:05] <03dammitwho> 7So what's down there? "Is the vapor dangerous?"
[11:06] <03Ferrinus> 12You probably don't want to breathe it without a cloth or something.
[11:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Spores."
[11:06] <03Crion_> 4Star will go second.
[11:07] <03Crion_> 4They'd prefer to go first, but, toxins aren't their specialty.
[11:07] <03trenchfoot> 13Good thing Dexys Violetta is wearing a mask. She's third.
[11:08] <03dammitwho> 7Princess will make an ersatz mask out of some cloth. It's fortunate that she doesn't need to breathe.
[11:09] <03Ferrinus> 12You slide down a ladder into a glowing, pulsing hell. This room might've been square once, and made of earth and stone. Now the floor and walls are all the same disquietingly organic mass, a tesselation of bones and shells and tendrils and membranes that never exactly repeats itself.
[11:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend had a red handkerchief in the pocket of his suit, he just ties it around his face before going down.
[11:09] <03Crion_> 4Star has both the shell mask and a cloth wrap on underneath it.
[11:09] <03Crion_> 4Star snaps and the spear-staff becomes a familiar whip-sword in their hand.
[11:10] <03Ferrinus> 12There's a screeching, chittering growl as a great scarab-like plate of chitin on the far wall quivers and then stretches forward, partially detaching itself from the surrounding tissue. It's like the head of a dragon - no, the head and forelegs of a dragon, now - that's sort of entombed within the wall but capable of stretching far enough to snarl and snap at you.
[11:11] <03Ferrinus> 12As it wakes, clumps of biomatter on either side of it quiver and swell, beginning to grow and pulsate into... something. Worse, at the same time, humanoid shapes rise from the floor, barely-coherent people made of equal parts swirling spores and regurgitated bone and organ.
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's a flash of light visible up the ladder, sunset purple. Below, Friend sweeps through the anima of cherry blossoms, hand on Zantetsuken's hilt.
[11:12] <03Crion_> 4Star: "Burn it. Burn it all."
[11:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend weaves between the zombies like they're the awkward kids in a nightclub. He touches the brim of his hat to the head in the wall, there's a razor-thin flash of white-light, and a smoking wound opens in the creature's skin, only to heal just as fast.
[11:32] <03Crion_> 4Star leaps straight over top of them, pushing off the ceiling and lancing straight at the creature in the wall in a flurry of whip-steel. Two dozen blows land, each healing up as soon as they cut, but Star is in position to do so much more, now.
[11:41] <03trenchfoot> 13Midnight's Darling, Dexys Violetta smashes the rising tide as they slough forward. Each kick disintigrates one of the horde, while another rises to take its place... it's hard to fight here! Everything just feels bad, and gross. She's going to have to spend ages washing this.
[11:42] <03Crion_> 4The tide of bodies surges up and in every direction -- but Last Westerly Star is already moving away.
[11:43] <03Ferrinus> 12The bodies are really easy to destroy. One solid hit pretty much causes them to explode and crumble. But as soon as you land, a new one just comes sprouting up from the floor before you, or behind you, or even beneath you! You think that there's an end to them... eventually...
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend takes a step back from the monster in the wall, ending up directly in the middle of a pack of the mutants. There's a sigh like a breeze on the wind and five of them fall to the ground in ten pieces. A streamer of light is visible around Friend's shoulders trailing down to his waist for a moment, and steam rises from the seam between the hilt and scabbard at his belt.
[11:49] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess snaps her fingers and gestures floridly at the lurching fungus zombies, searing their flesh black and dropping them to the squirming floor, one after another.
[11:51] <03Ferrinus> 12The tide turns in some way as Blossom lets loose. The squirming creatures, presumably reverse-engineered from the two or three people caught in the initial fungal eruption, shrivel and wither in the torrent of blue flame. Fewer and fewer of them are growing back up from the floor, and the torrents of fungal spores released as they crack open are consumed by fire before they can set 
[11:51] <03Ferrinus> 12themselves upon you.
[12:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend continues to drift aimlessly through the monsters until he doesn't. As if responding to an invisible cue, he lunges forward, drawing his sword while his feet aren't touching the ground. Right, left, right - three slashes across the face of the thing in the wall and it falls to the ground in ribbons of gore.
[12:11] <03Crion_> 4When the thing in the wall attacked Star, they responded with the scorn of the whip -- searing its sides before curling the extended coil around its throat and flipping sideways across its body, tearing its throat open and sending its head whiplashing back the other way...
[12:12] <03Crion_> 4Right into position for Friend's blade.
[12:12] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys Violetta dances in between the fodder, smashing them as she goes. Spinning backfists, twirling low kicks, even a flying kick or two - but they persist!
[12:20] <03Ferrinus> 12They persist, but they're persisting less and less. They're not all that persists, though - the two pulsating egg things on either side of the now-shredded hive overseer are reacting to its death!
[12:21] <03Ferrinus> 12From each, a spined tentacle erupts. They're slick with slime, clearly not matured, and they don't even attempt to attack the solars - instead, they jam themselves into the carcass of the overseer, attempting to pump it full of demonic vigor!
[12:23] <03Crion_> 4Star snaps their fingers and Iscariot shivers into a great lance shape -- but it finds little purchase.
[12:25] <03Ferrinus> 12It's too hard to tell which of these organs are actually vital.
[12:31] <03Crion_> 4Then Star just keeps goring the damn thing.
[12:31] <03Ferrinus> 12Fortunately, fire does not discriminate. Between another salvo of flames and another minute or so of backbreaking labor, the Squared Circle is able to scorch and dismember the ersatz hive they've descended into to the point that it can no longer fight back.
[12:32] <03dammitwho> 7Since the cowering mobsters can't hear her, Princess can voice her real concerns. "This wasn't an accident, this was a test run. They didn't get help when they broke the jade slip they'd been given because the people who'd sent them these... things assumed they were already dead."
[12:33] <03Crion_> 4Star: "Reasonable assumption."
[12:33] <03Crion_> "It also means they'll be by to check on their work."
[12:33] <03Crion_> "Eventually."
[12:34] <03Crion_> 4Prodding the sizzling goop. "We should be prepared for them."
[12:34] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "I don't think the Whispers were a gang, before. They were some type of cult."
[12:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Cult to who?"
[12:38] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys: "...not sure. They kept good records, good info. Useful, but shady. Never looked too close."
[12:40] <03Ferrinus> 12You're able to work as you talk. Blossom, I presume, doesn't stop the fireworks once nothing's actually trying to bite her, but does her best to scour the very earth and stone. That isn't all that'll be needed, of course - Eikichi can talk her through the requisite benedictions - but it's a start.
[12:40] <03Ferrinus> 12And beyond that, the Circle's going to need to round up any of the other infected, dispose of the corpses of any who've succumbed, hunt down anything that might've spawned or sprouted as a result... grisly work. But even that's not the main thing.
[12:41] <03Ferrinus> 12The main thing - which they've been contractually bound to do - is to make sure no word spreads as to the cause of the outbreak. And there's three men just one floor up who know.
[12:42] <03dammitwho> 7Well, that's easy to solve.
[12:43] <03Ferrinus> 12The Circle cleans up the rest of this mess and moves on with their plans... next week.

[08:29] <03Ferrinus> 12A cesspit/breeding pool for a weird fungal strain of kruthik parademons has been burned and broken by the Squared Circle, but there's fallout left to deal with. What to do with these three men who basically know the score? How best to purge the rest of the neighborhood of any lingering infection?
[08:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Seems like the two easiest options are tell them the truth (the Emissary will probably erase them if they talk, so they shouldn't talk) or kill them ourselves. First one seems easier.
[08:32] <03Crion> 4Good to keep our eyes open for whoever their backup was supposed to be, too.
[08:32] <03Crion> 4I'm guessing they'll have more permanent opinions on how to deal with the men.
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It only takes Eikichi a couple of minutes to convince the men that the Squared Circle has their interests at heart - they helped where the city didn't, where their bosses didn't. And he convinces them that their best interest is to keep this quiet - for their sake and for everybody else's. It doesn't take a lot of work. People tend to listen to Eikichi. Probably because of his obvious 
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10wisdom.
[08:46] <03Crion> 4If all else fails, Last Westerley Star is standing by to menace them.
[08:47] <03Ferrinus> 12Before long, the only response Eikichi's getting is fervent nodding - especially from the one guy who's going to need the sorcerer's medical expertise if he doesn't want to be dead in another couple days.
[08:47] <03Ferrinus> 12Speaking of, you're going to have to round up the other infected, find and dispose of any who've succumbed, arrange treatments, make sure anything that's washed down the canals is dealt with...
[08:48] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess: "See? Everything's going to work out."
[08:48] <03Crion> 4This job is turning out to be suspiciously like work.
[08:57] <03Ferrinus> 12At least it's work with fairly interesting stakes. Blossom, for instance, becomes increasingly aware of the kind of hideous health disaster that her perspicuous tracking and judicious application of cleansing fire is averting. It looks like overall only one body ended up falling into and washing down the canals, and, thankfully enough, whatever was spreading through it wasn't (yet) 
[08:57] <03Ferrinus> 12adapted to living in and spreading through water. So, after a search of hours, Blossom comes across a sort of glowing cocoon growing out of the torso of a withered body that's washed up on the side of an abandoned sewer passageway.
[08:58] <03Ferrinus> 12Nothing stops her from carbonizing it entirely - or from following the easy-to-miss slime trails forking away from it and immolating some wriggling, wormlike things that were trying to build lairs of their own.
[09:00] <03dammitwho> 7Invincible Scholar Princess lurks in the deeper shadows of the already-fairly-deeply shadowed High Hollow. Through turning up nigh-invisible scuff marks where a body was been dragged into the river, tiny splotches of blood and damp, and watching the stains showing high tide, she tracks down the corpse that got away. A few swift gouts of flame see to the cocoon and the larvae, and then 
[09:00] <03dammitwho> 7a brief touch on a withered forehead turns the corpse into fading motes of light.
[09:01] <03Ferrinus> 12Eikichi, Ir, and Tatsuya, still disguised as people with far more interesting names, have similar experiences back in the undercity shantytown. There's a lot of knocking on doors and interrogating locals and cross-referencing different stories, and, in a couple cases, simply following one's nose.
[09:03] <03Ferrinus> 12The three find a few people on the brink of death, shivering and withering in their own dwellings. The find corpses, too, shriveled and blackened wrecks with shelves of fungus growing out from between their ribs and quivering eggs in their abdominal cavities. At one point, Ir opens a door to a dead man's home and finds a wolf-sized kruthik pouncing straight at her, fangs and pincers 
[09:03] <03Ferrinus> 12gleaming, and is forced to break its back and strangle it.
[09:04] <03Crion> 4Ah, kebabs.
[09:04] <03Ferrinus> 12The better part of a day later, the whole business is done - High Hollow's free of "plague", and anyone with even an inkling of what that plague was or where it may have came from has been talked, sworn, or terrified into secrecy.
[09:06] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Are we going to wait around and see if anyone shows to check up on the disaster this was supposed to be?"
[09:06] <03Crion> *4Star: "Are we going to wait around and see if anyone shows to check up on the disaster this was supposed to be?"
[09:07] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "Death's Notaries' work is done here, but ours isn't."
[09:08] <03Ferrinus> 12An entire warehouse has, per Ying's specifications, been converted into a house of healing; burning medicinal herbs and burnished holy symbols deck the walls there, and the dozen-odd infected who remain huddle there and wait for the corruption within their bodies to subside. Fortunately, it's going well, and the rest of the neighborhood is really pulling together - having been 
[09:08] <03Ferrinus> 12galvanized by Eikichi and given the chance to flex their collective muscles in rebuilding the place to start with, the rest of the residents are quick to bring tea, take care of kids, and otherwise assist in the community's convalescence.
[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "What's next?"
[09:08] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "We report to the Council, and then we backtrack that shipment. Off the clock."
[09:10] <03trenchfoot> 13Dexys Violetta: "Sounds like a plan." 13Her mildly terrifying appearance might have made the healing a little slower to get started than she'd like, but once her skill with medicine became obvious, the mask was no longer an issue. Something to consider for a future disguise - friendliness. Although that wasn't really the point here... difficult!
[09:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "Speaking as Friend, I refuse to put in unpaid work."
[09:12] <03Crion> 4Star: "This was supposed to be whose responsibility before ours? The local contractor Blooded?"
[09:13] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "Qasha and the other one, yeah."
[09:13] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "Yes. The advice Qasha gave us - do exactly what we're contracted for and no more - was sound. Tracing the source would be good for the city, but the Council didn't hire Death's Notaries to do what's good for the city, they hired us to do what they want. The wrong kind of initiative is worse than no initiative."
[09:14] <03dammitwho> "So we'll do it as the Squared Circle."
[09:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Friend: "Keeping in mind we're still bound by the terms of the contract no matter how we're dressed, I'm on board."
[09:15] <03Crion> 4Star: "I'm just wondering what the outcome our mysterious packagemen were planning for was."
[09:16] <03dammitwho> 7Princess: "We won't know that until we know who they are."
[09:16] <03dammitwho> "The list of people who would benefit from a crisis in Nexus is long."
[09:16] <03Crion> 4Star: "Well, this one isn't hypothetical."
[09:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The Whispers were a cult who's expanded. I want to know who they were a cult to."
[09:17] <03Crion> "This is the second time we've run into these things in less than a week. They're big in Firewander."
[09:17] <03Crion> "If our leads go cold we can try again there."
[09:21] <03Ferrinus> 12When the Squ- when Death's Notaries report to Brueghel, the man goes searching through a sheaf of papers in his desk - magical ones, if anyone's got the wherewithal to check - and then nods smartly to the lot of you. "That's all the Council needs... at this moment. How are you best contacted?"
[09:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Infallible Messenger."
[09:24] <03Ferrinus> 12Brueghel seems mildly displeased. "Those don't grow on trees. Have you a... base, a common a haunt? A convenient location for a dead drop?"
[09:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We move around a lot. Where would be convenient for you?"
[09:27] <03Ferrinus> 12Some more paper rustles before Brueghel decides on, and describes to you, a tree in a particular bend in Parko Llana, Nexus's largest public park. Important but not life-or-death urgent notices and requests will be found in a trapdoor hidden between and beneath some tree roots there.
[09:28] <03Ferrinus> 12That being squared away, the Notaries are paid a substantial sum in jade and silver, exactly as agreed upon, and then dismissed.
[09:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's good. Successfully maneuvered into picking a place that doesn't reveal anything about where we like to hang out or what we do in our off hours.
[09:28] <03Crion> 4That's more convenient than a messanger? Crazy.
[09:29] <03Ferrinus> 12Sorcerers aren't as common as having two of them for friends makes it seem!
[09:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Especially not when they're probably contracted by the spell.
[09:29] <03trenchfoot> 13Maybe get good???
[09:29] <03trenchfoot> 13Specifically, get good friends who can cast spells for you.
[09:30] <03Ferrinus> 12At any rate, you're now left to your own devices... for the moment. Ir and "Wild Rose" have both got gladiatorial bouts coming up, although Rose's is probably going to be against another handful of mortals and wild beasts that don't really merit blow-by-blow attention. Ir, though, has a date with the Twin Dragons.
[09:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Anything else going on? Maybe some clothing orders for Ying?
[09:33] <03Ferrinus> 12Separately, there's a standing invitation for the sorcerers in your circle to talk shop with the enigmatic Arianna. Otherwise, the city ticks along - the steady stream of refugees from the east is driving down all sorts of wages, to the consternation of some and the pleasure of others, and the Guild seems to have taken down its public requests for help with its bizarre logistical 
[09:33] <03Ferrinus> 12problems, and the announcement by a luminary of the Gymnasium of a miraculous formula for transforming worthless gold into priceless silver has turned out to be a fraud, and...
[09:34] <03dammitwho> 7Hey! Gold isn't worthless, it has a number of ornamental and alchemical uses!
[09:34] <03Crion> 4So basically worthless.
[09:34] <03trenchfoot> 6Not to the right people.
[09:35] <03Ferrinus> 12All right, but it was funnier to say it the way I did.
[09:43] <03Ferrinus> 12For a little while now, banners, billboards, and pieces of street art throughout the city of Nexus have been cryptically prophetic - They're coming! or Beware...! or similar. Over time, they've become increasingly representational - a sliver of a huge, staring eye visible through a great crack in stone, or a figure silhouette against a wall of fire, or a saurian footprint within 
[09:43] <03Ferrinus> 12which are the crushed remains of a molten sword.
[09:44] <03Crion> 4Ugh.
[09:44] <03Crion> 4Tacky.
[09:45] <03Ferrinus> 12Around midweek, the Guild reaches out to Blossom to reach out to Ir - the hero's to be present for a special ceremony of unveiling, to hit just as this ad campaign reaches its crescendo. We'll need Ir in her full battle regalia, they're told, and ready to at least do a cool jump or something as the great match is made fully public.
[09:46] <03dammitwho> 7Perfect. They'll be ready.
[09:46] <03Ferrinus> 12A covered wagon arrives at the Scarlet Palace well in advance to pick Ir and her retinue up; she's not to be visible to the crowd until the exact moment of announcement.
[09:46] <03Crion> 4The things we do for our public.
[09:46] <03dammitwho> "Don't worry about it, Ir. I've got your entrance and theme music all set up."
[09:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10?!
[09:47] <03Crion> "Oh. Do you."
[09:47] <03trenchfoot> 13!!
[09:48] <03Crion> 4We'll...see how this goes.
[09:48] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "I know, I know, but you can't sing your own entrance. They look down on that kind of thing. It has to be like a miniature Triumph. All you have to do is walk out slowly and work the crowd a little."
[09:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Are you going to dress up?"
[09:51] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I mean, I'm gonna wear my armor."
[09:52] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "The glowing plate? That's good. That's very good."
[09:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah!" 10Then he looks at Blossom. "Are you going to dress up?"
[09:53] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Me? I hadn't planned on it... I don't want to distract from Ir."
[09:53] <03Ferrinus> 12The grand announcement is being made at the huge plaza directly behind Nexus's own gates, between the Firewander and Bastion districts. The high walls have been festooned with banners representing the Guild, the city, the grand arena, and five or six dozen different businesses and conglomerates and brand names and whatever else. The gates, normally wide open, have been sealed tightly 
[09:53] <03Ferrinus> 12shut - those wishing to enter the city will have to use the smaller doors set into the wall at regular intervals throughout the Bastion district.
[09:55] <03Crion> 4Not a huge fan of Guild advertising being all over this, but that's how it goes.
[09:57] <03Ferrinus> 12The announcement's to be made at noon, but crowds have started to amass since before sunup. With them, of course, is the usual flotilla of concession stands, souvenir shops, food carts, and of course official arena ticket sellers. There are plenty of different matches to which tickets are being sold, Wild Rose's next bout among them, but the really big deal is the MYSTERY MATCH, ??? 
[09:57] <03Ferrinus> 12v. ???, limited seating, buy now for best value!!!
[09:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Does Ir get free tickets to hand out or are we gonna have to buy seats to this?
[09:58] <03Ferrinus> 12She does, but not for lack of trying on the Guild's part. Blossom was shrewd enough to catch that one, fortunately.
[09:59] <03trenchfoot> 13Boy, I'm really starting to not like these Guild guys!
[10:01] <03Ferrinus> 12Anything the Squared Circle needs to get done or make sure of before they hop into their bronze-age limousine and head for the entrance square?
[10:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's going to smuggle two bottles of wine in under his coat.
[10:04] <03trenchfoot> 13That's a really good idea! Ying will pocket some snacks to avoid the ripoff prices they charge. And maybe some refreshments too.
[10:05] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom's ready. Blossom's SO ready. Ever since she had this idea, it's like there's been something crawling around underneath her skin, itching to get out.
[10:05] <03Ferrinus> 12That's very wise, although, if the Guild gets their way in the next few Council meetings, highly illegal.
[10:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10She's not gonna play THAT song, is she?
[10:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Well, it's not illegal yet. Fair game!
[10:07] <03Ferrinus> 12At any rate, the Squared Circle's wagon is just one of many in the streets of Nexus that morning. It's perhaps distinguished by the fact that it's pulled by a pair of hearty emas birds rather than cheaper and less reliable horses, but enough of the wealthy are at least intrigued by the arena's massive ad campaign that it doesn't render you an object of serious suspicion.
[10:08] <03Ferrinus> 12Maybe the way other wagons or crowd goers part for you as you approach the central plaza - either willingly or because they've been rudely pushed aside by guards and other facilitators - is unusual, but, hell, the Guild does all sorts of quiet boring logistical stuff.
[10:08] <03Ferrinus> 12Anyway, everyone's attention is on the other side of the square. Specifically, on the great gates, which keep shaking.
[10:08] <03Crion> 4Errant takes exception to this slander.
[10:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi cranes out of the wagon for a better look.
[10:09] <03Crion> 4Where's Ir during all this?
[10:10] <03Ferrinus> 12A slow, steady, thump... thump... thump... is transforming by degrees into a BOOM... BOOM... BOOM. A deep rumbling is becoming increasingly audible. An announcer, his voice magically amplified by a twisted, coral-encrusted seashell he's speaking into from a podium on the far side of the square, is doing his absolute best to heighten expectations and concentrate adrenaline - it's 
[10:10] <03Ferrinus> 12coming! No... THEY'RE coming! Something great! Something terrible! Could it be the deadliest threat this city's faced yet?!
[10:11] <03dammitwho> 7I'm assuming the Squared Circle split up once they hit the Plaza - Eikichi and Ying to someplace with a nice view, Blossom and Ir hidden from sight on the other side of the square from the rumbling gates.
[10:12] <03Ferrinus> 12That's easily arranged. If need be, Ying and Eikichi could've benefited from some VIP treatment, and had a way made for them to the very front of the crowd or even into some high seats.
[10:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Need definitely be.
[10:13] <03Ferrinus> 12Ah, so there is aught can be done.
[10:14] <03Ferrinus> 12Anyway, the mood of the crowd is reaching a fever pitch. They're shouting at the announcer and at each other, desperately buying event tickets before - upon the revelation of the actual fighters - the price goes up, scarfing down sausages-in-buns and cups of shaved ice... and then the sun reaches its zenith and the gates explode open.
[10:15] <03Ferrinus> 12I do mean explode; there's a flash of fire behind them, and the great wood-and-metal doors are smoking as the whip around on their hinges and slam into the wall. Barreling in through them, completely unfettered, is a pair of enormous tyrant lizards!
[10:16] <03Crion> 4...
[10:16] <03Crion> 4Sigh.
[10:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Yeah!! Yeah!!!!!
[10:16] <03Crion> 4Completely unfettered.
[10:17] <03Crion> 4Time to go to work.
[10:17] <03Ferrinus> 12Announcer: "Oh, no. Oh, no! It's the TWIN DRAGONS!" 12And he's partially right. The two creatures have near-identical builds and scales, down to their brow ridges and spinal bumps and so on, and each has the same tiger stripe pattern running down its length, but they're of complementary rather than identical colors. One's a deep orange, and one's an ashen, purplish grey.
[10:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's hooting and hollering.
[10:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Everybody loves dinosaurs. I don't care who you are, that's fun, right there.
[10:18] <03Ferrinus> 12Astute observers will note that while these lumbering monsters are literally unfettered, that may not be the metaphorical case; there's a small encampment of wagons and guards and observers and so on behind them, on the other side of the gates, and they don't appear to have been eaten or incinerated or something.
[10:19] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying's a little more reserved than Eikichi, but he's right. He's right! Dinosaurs are awesome!
[10:19] <03Ferrinus> 12In particular, a lanky and lightly-dressed southerner seems to be keeping himself within some twenty or thirty yards behind them, the air around him rippling as he stares at them hard.
[10:20] <03dammitwho> 7Does it look like Ir's about to break kayfabe?
[10:20] <03Crion> 4Nah.
[10:20] <03dammitwho> 7Alright then.
[10:20] <03Crion> 4She is concerned about this whole...concept...though.
[10:20] <03Ferrinus> 12Most people don't notice this, because they're busy shrieking as the primordial reptiles cough cones of elemental destruction into the air. One plume of raging fire and one howling blizzard go stabbing into Nexus's sky.
[10:20] <03Crion> 4Seems dumb!
[10:22] <03Ferrinus> 12Announcer: "It would take an army! It would take a legion! It would take a wyld hunt for even a CHANCE against these monstrosities! Who, who, WHO, could POSSIBLY-- what's this?!"
[10:22] <03Crion> 4And here we go.
[10:23] <03dammitwho> 7At the signal, Blossom takes the smoke bombs she begged from Ying days ago out of a small sack and tosses them!
[10:23] <03Ferrinus> 12While the crowd's attention was elsewhere, one last banner was hoisted up behind a dais right before Ir's wagon - it's a field of solid color across which points a silver spear.
[10:23] <03dammitwho> 7With a PSSSSSH white smoke begins to billow out, obscuring Ir and Blossom herself and wreathing the dais in mysterious, misty tendrils.
[10:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "?!"
[10:24] <03dammitwho> 7She raises a hand, one finger pointed to the heavens. If this doesn't work, she's going to look very foolish. Blossom never considers the possibility for a moment.
[10:25] <03dammitwho> 7There are no storm clouds in the sky, no hint of rain, but a blue lightning bolt streaks down from the sky with a CRASSSH, briefly illuminating the smoke clouds with a coruscating blue!
[10:27] <03dammitwho> 7In Blossom's hands now is a zither that any musician would recognize as a masterwork. Perfectly constructed of aged songwood from the East, inlaid with electrum spelling out Old Realm runes that read, in a rough translation: THIS MACHINE SLAYS DARKNESS.
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Sugoi~
[10:28] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom takes a deep breath, readies the zither with the heel of one hand on the custom distortion pedal, and begins to sing.
[10:28] <03dammitwho> 7https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZD3FAUqJEg
[10:29] <03dammitwho> 7As she sings, spinning pinwheels of fireworks seem to appear from nowhere out of the smoke, and beams of flashing light shine upwards, illuminating the bottoms of the clouds.
[10:31] <03dammitwho> 7Everyone across the square can hear her perfectly - her voice reverberates from wall to wall without diminishing in strength. "THE SUN GOT UP ONE MORNING HE WAS IN AN UGLY MOOD / HE WAS SICK OF FLOODS AND PLAGUES HE WANTED SOMETHING REALLY RUDE / HE MADE A BIG SIAKA OUT OF BROKEN GLASS AND GLUE / THEN HE GAVE HER TWO LEGS AND A NASTY ATTITUDE"
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10*_*
[10:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying is on her feet screaming along from the moment Blossom starts singing. This! Is! Incredible!
[10:37] <03Crion> 4Through the smoke, something golden begins to burn through.
[10:37] <03Crion> 4(This song is RIDICULOUS.)
[10:37] <03Crion> 4(...And cool.)
[10:53] <03Ferrinus> 12As one, the Twin Dragons turn to Blossom's performance, and to the cloud of smoke from which beams of light are firing. The red one snarls, taking a menacing step forward. The blue one narrows its eyes and draws back, as though a viper about to strike.
[10:54] <03Crion> 4Then the smokecloud ripples and explodes away, torn apart by a burning pillar of sunlight that drives up into the heavens.
[10:55] <03Crion> 4There, standing in similarly-burning golden armor, with a great looming anima spearmaiden standing tall behind her, is Ir.
[11:01] <03Ferrinus> 12Announcer: "... Ir! It's Ir, Twice-Traitor! Ir, Chosen of the Sun, and EXCLUSIVE participant in the NEXUS GRAND ARENAAAA!"
[11:02] <03Ferrinus> 12Announcer: "Can SHE stand up to the elemental tyrants?!" 12That kind of talk has a lot of purchase in Nexus, of course. In the River Province in general, really.
[11:02] <03Crion> 4Man, I dunno, maybe don't put "Twice Traitor" on the bill, that just kinda leads to questions--
[11:07] <03Crion> 4Whatever. She sticks the landing. Iscariot is dancing around her as the smoke burns away, without her seeming to even move as she stares down the Tyrant Lizards...and points.
[11:09] <03Ferrinus> 12The crowd's deathly silent as the two "dragons" - again, moving as one - both flinch. They draw back, mouths tightening and eyes widening, but thanks to the force of Ir's presence and the magnetic power of Blossom's music neither can so much as look away, and certainly not turn and run.
[11:10] <03Crion> 4...Is 'deathly silent' the mood we were going for here...?
[11:10] <03Crion> 4This carny stuff is hard.
[11:10] <03Ferrinus> 12The tableau of the glowing, gold-and-silver Chosen pointing imperiously at the two practically-cowering elemental monsters persists for five or six seconds before the crowd erupts into wild cheers. As Blossom's performance draws to a close, and as the tall handler of the two beasts begins gesticulating behind them, the tyrant lizards turn slowly away and slink back out through Nexus's 
[11:10] <03Ferrinus> 12gates, growling and grumbling to themselves but not so much as snapping at the crowd to their left and right.
[11:11] <03Crion> 4Phew.
[11:12] <03Ferrinus> 12Announcer: "SundaysundaySUNDAY this disagreement is settled once and for all, ladies and gentlemen of Nexus! At noon exactly, in the grand Nexus arena! Show up early! Buy your tickets earlier still! Don't forget our other events-"
[11:13] <03Ferrinus> 12All the pent-up energy of the crowd finally spills outward here as people rush in for tickets, or to try to follow the tyrant lizards out the gates, or to beg Ir and Blossom for autographs or similar. The Guild's there for you to block them off as you gracefully leave, unless you desire otherwise.
[11:15] <03Crion> 4Yeah, no autographs yet.
[11:15] <03Crion> 4Haven't even won anything.
[11:16] <03Ferrinus> 12In the following days, news of the event rages through the city like wildfire. Elementally infused mutants like those creatures are precious rarities even when they don't come in matched pairs, and Ir's probably the first of the Chosen of the Sun to operate openly and with full endorsement of the Guild and city rather than in secret except during insanely grisly public disturbances. 
[11:16] <03Ferrinus> 12The match is sold out before the day is through, and soon enterprising engineers and thaumaturgists are working on using lightweight building materials to build the arena stands even higher, or arrange for a small fleet of observation balloons, or similar.
[11:17] <03dammitwho> 7Once all four solars are back in the carriage, Blossom leans back smugly: "You're going to be the most popular match in Nexus history."
[11:17] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying's humming the theme Blossom sang and swaying back and forth. Incredible.
[11:17] <03Crion> 4Ir's banished the armor. "Surely there's been something more impressive than Tyrant Lizards on a card."
[11:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi lets out a strangled squeak of excitement when Blossom and Ir get back in the carriage. "That was AWESOME"
[11:18] <03Crion> "Nice work on the intro, though."
[11:18] <03Ferrinus> 12In fact, a Guild official is talking to Blossom and Eikichi before the day is through - how easily can you, say, project an image of the fight to distant viewers?
[11:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10I don't know, how easily can we do that?
[11:18] <03Crion> 4Oh Sun.
[11:19] <03dammitwho> 7It would depend on how distant... and she has to be singing for it to work.
[11:21] <03Ferrinus> 12Unfortunately, sorcerous projects generally take a week's time, and you've got like four days. Maybe you can discover an appropriate artifact somewhere...? If it's something you're seriously interested in you can put your back into it over the rest of the week.
[11:21] <03Ferrinus> 12Anything else the Circle wants to do in that time?
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What was that about academic lectures on the nature of the Wyld?
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi'll probably be looking into that unless Blossom or somebody has something else they want to do.
[11:23] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying will be checking up on the dead drop as well as looking into the plague, and whether anyone's come to check it out after the fact.
[11:26] <03dammitwho> 7One evening, Blossom's leaning on the wall near the door to Eikichi's room, holding part of his Death's Notaries costume and the glittery cape from his horrible outfit.
[11:26] <03dammitwho> "Hold up there, Magistrate Billowing-Cape's-Rose."
[11:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's just on his way to wash his face and write a while before bed when he sees Blossom holding things for him to wear. He glances up and down the hall before whispering "...out here?"
[11:27] <03Ferrinus> 12The new scholarship on the relation of the Wyld to the stars is in fact being spearheaded by noted scholar Alferi, the fat southerner who Tatsuya rescued from the rakshastan floating above the Hedgehog and who Eikichi cured of mutation.
[11:28] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "How can you sleep... how can any of us sleep... when there's crime afoot?!"
[11:29] <03dammitwho> "Get dressed. We're going to lurk the rooftops and punish ne'er-do-wells."
[11:29] <03Ferrinus> 12Alferi's a member of the "Dolmen of Learning", a barely-secret-these-days society of occultists and historians mostly populated by graduates of the Serigala Gymnasium. Upon his return, he penned a whole mess of scrolls about what he's calling the 'stellar Wyld', a long-overlooked portion of the formless chaos surrounding Creation.
[11:30] <03Ferrinus> 12Ying finds nothing at the dead drop... yet. But it's a good habit to get into. Assuming nothing takes her out of comission and that she keeps checking every day or at least every few days, I'll let you know once Brueghel's got another mission for the Notaries.
[11:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi blinks. "Oh. Oh, okay!" 10He'll take the cape and mask and duck inside his room. He comes back out dark, masked, and shimmering, hat in hand. "What's the plan?"
[11:36] <03Ferrinus> 12In her trips to and fro, Ying does pick up on the fact that - to her delight, or her horror? - Eikichi's last public spectacle has made something of a splash in the city's visual imagination. People are asking each other where this "Ying" person's shop even is, and speculating that he or she might be some magistrate or financier's private clothier, or something. She might do well to 
[11:36] <03Ferrinus> 12capitalize on this before it either diffuses or gets caught by someone else.
[11:37] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom shakes her head. "Uh-uh. Not this time. You're the dashing hero, I'm just the humble sidekick. We're following your plan, as long as it isn't 'go to sleep instead'. This is your city- where are the people preyed upon by bandits and sneak-thieves? Where do the people cry out for the watchful justice of Magistrate Billowing-Cape's-Rose?"
[11:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi flips his hat over in his hands as he looks at Blossom, unreadable behind the mask. "...alright. Meet me on the roof in five minutes."
[11:39] <03dammitwho> 7She grins eagerly. "I'll be there."
[11:40] <03trenchfoot> 13Oh no. Oh, no no no. No. No! No. This is... not how she wanted to make a name for herself... but she can't let someone else ruin her reputation. She made Eikichi's outfit badly on purpose. It took a lot of time, effort, and skill to make something that terrible. A real eye for what works, deliberately ignored! And maybe they just want to know who could make something so skillful, and they won't want just copies of that outfit. 
[11:40] <03trenchfoot> Please.
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Blossom will find 'the Magistrate' kneeling contemplatively on the hotel's roof, overlooking the canal, his cape billowing and glittering majestically behind him.
[11:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is she coming out as anyone in particular?
[11:44] <03Ferrinus> 12Ying has already seen some people with boxy little satchels worked into the fronts of their belts. It IS pretty convenient.
[11:44] <03trenchfoot> 13Noooo
[11:47] <03dammitwho> 7She'll be wearing her Invincible Scholar Princess getup, but without Ying's help she doesn't resemble the Princess except in clothing and the large round glasses. She's kept the boots, Eikichi will note.
[11:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He will note that. For his part, Eikichi looks pretty much exactly like Friend-of-the-Far-Side. The outfit's spectacular but in terms of makeup and so forth it was basically just him under the hat and mask. He can even recolor his own hair. Ying's put him through more ambitious projects. "In Nexus, there's always somebody who needs protection they're not getting. A voice in the 
[11:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> darkness nobody is there to hear."
[11:56] <03Ferrinus> 12And so go the following few days for the Squared Circle. Ying struggles to set up shop premises, Eikichi and Blossom both fight crime and brainstorm how an apocalyptic battle might be televised, and Ir racks her brains to remember who it was that talked her into this so that she can begin to properly debate killing them.
[11:56] <03Ferrinus> 12Ir versus the Twin Dragons... next week!

[22:25] <03Quaker> The mariachis are beginning to pack up their instruments. Around them, the last tourists filter out of the little Old Town compound. The grounds crew passes by, extinguishing a few street lamps as businesses begin to shutter for the evening. The sudden dimming of light makes everyone’s shadow longer and more indistinct. 
[22:27] <03Quaker> Abigail Gannon, the Ambassador to San Diego, is rather embarrassed at her offer. Her servant holds open a small case. Inside are a pair of featureless white porcelain masks on red silk. 
[22:31] <03Crion> 4If they're precisely identical, Cav will take the one on the left.
[22:32] <03Quaker> “…a rather backwards local custom. There’s no requirement, of course, to wear anything that you don’t want to, and I’d certainly understand you refusing it, Baron. But it may smooth things over with the more…traditional…Court members you’ll meet…” Abigail raises an eyebrow. “Well…I do have the extra, so….” 
01[22:33] <03banana> 6KJ's holding her fire here. Wilson Frost might not even have been on the train, and he hasn't reacted one way or other if not. If it was her.. but she wouldn't be here if she was Nosferatu.
[22:35] <03Quaker> The Ambassador and her assistant look around. “Oh. I could have sworn he was here. Nervousness wasted, I suppose.” 
[22:36] <03Crion> 4Cav checks his phone. "He should be here shortly."
[22:36] <03Crion> "Or in town, at least."
[22:36] <03Crion> "I think he took the car service down."
01[22:38] <03banana> 6KJ: "Perhaps we can deliver the masks, Abby. Do you have names for any of those more dot dot traditional dudes?"
[22:38] <03Quaker> As the lamps fade, KJ realizes that in the shadows cast by the lamps, there are about a half dozen figures standing there that she hadn’t noticed before. She can’t make much of them beyond their presence. They don’t move. 
[22:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A car pulls up into the big lot near the platform, an oldish SUV. Wilson slides out of the back while two women come out of the front seat and go around back. There's the sound of boxes moving. Wilson's wearing a sort of puffy white vest over his usual suit. He's only a few quick steps from the others. "Baron. Baron. Ambassador."
[22:41] <03Quaker> Cav sees them well enough. Tall, wearing the porcelain masks. clothed in black robes that reach from head to toe. They’re still enough that they look like black pillars, and tall enough to make the people milling about look like children. There must be half a dozen of them, spread out through Old Town, looking in their direction. If he turns to look, he can see one standing in the shadow of the raised freeway as well. 
[22:41] <03Crion> 4...
[22:42] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Ambassador."
[22:42] <03Crion> "Is there anything...else...you'd like to tell us."
[22:42] <03Crion> "Before we depart."
[22:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson doesn't see them. He makes a habit of not looking around in strange places. Makes you look nosy or paranoid. He does see the masks.
[22:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Doesn't say anything yet. But he sees them.
[22:43] <03Crion> "Hello, Baron Hollywood. Welcome to San Diego."
01[22:43] <03banana> 6For a moment KJ doesn't know what Cav's on about, but when she's turning to greet Wilson she sees them. An ambush by the Brilliant Court after all? Too many to be observers? She tenses, something in her blood rather than actual muscle.
[22:43] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh, on the other hand, is the sort who will look directly at them.
01[22:44] <03banana> "Hi, you missed the mariachis.."
[22:44] <03Crion> 4...Are they invisible to everyone else? He glances over at KJ. She can see them, right?
[22:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh no."
[22:44] <03Crion> 4Maybe it has something to do with the masks.
01[22:45] <03banana> 6(KJ's expression hasn't changed, but she's looking the same way Cavanaugh is. Probably due to not having seen enough rather than any particular phlegmatism.)
01[22:46] <03banana> "It was kind of wild. I got this technicolour shawl, see-" 
[22:47] <03Quaker> Abby is busy going through the list of people to more or less avoid: “Count San Ysidro, definitely the Count of Coronado, hmm, the Prince of Tijuana-“ She bows when she sees Wilson. “Oh! Hello, Baron. Just give me a moment-“ She signals to her assistant, who runs over to the few remaining mariachis and gestures quickly. With a look of weariness, they begin to play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qadKIvx3mc
[22:47] <03Crion> 4The Prince of Tijuana, huh.
[22:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson puts his hands up. "Please, please. I appreciate it, but you fellas are up late enough as it is."
[22:49] <03Quaker> Then she sees where they’re looking at, raises a hand to her eyes to get a better look, her smile tightening. “Hmph. Just a few local characters. The local Nosferatu community is a bit tight-knit. Very insular. And wrapped up in this whole religion thing. Well, don’t pay them any mind. It’s not as if they’re likely to talk to you even if you go up and say hi, anyway.” 
[22:51] <03Crion> 4Cav: "So how does this...work? Can only we see them?" 4He glances around. "Am I walking into some kind of 'masquerade violation' joke?"
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Oh. Well, if they're cool with being talked about in the third person while in earshot, we're all good here?"
[22:52] <03Crion> 4Vampires are fucking weirdos, man.
[22:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10What's next on the itinerary? Where are we going from here? Wilson'll ask if he didn't already get told.
[22:55] <03Quaker> Abby: “They’ve been here longer than anyone. If they’ve ever had trouble with the Masquerade, it’ll be the first I’ve heard of it.” She checks her schedule. “I think that’s everything on my end. Where’s your driver? I expect the Princess has sent someone…” 
01[22:56] <03banana> "Worst comes to worst, we all cram in with Baron Hollywood or hope Uber knows where 'Casa Figueroa de Solano y Medina' is."
[22:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I've got the room, definitely."
[22:56] <03Quaker> On cue, a young man in full livery dress who had been hovering around the edges steps forward. “Good evening, uh, Barons. I’ll get your things and put them in the car, if you don’t mind.” He indicates a limousine parked nearby. 
[22:58] <03Crion> 4Cav gives the figures one last look. He's not using Auspex. They're definitely just, standing right there. But if he doesn't look at one of them directly it's hard to see any of them, let alone tell what they look like. And everyone else just seems to be going about their business.
[22:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's ghouls have several bags they're unloading from the SUV, as well as a massive black leather case that looks sized for an upright orchestra bass.
[22:58] <03Crion> 4He shakes his head.
[22:59] <03Crion> 4Are the ghouls staying with us as well, or are Bryan and Brian heading off to a hotel?
[23:00] <03Quaker> The Princess’s people have already offered the use of several guest wings to hold their combined staffs. 
01[23:00] <03banana> 6KJ's things include their carrier, the colorless Zelda Essos, so they can get themselves to the limo. She'll bid Abby farewell and endeavour to keep the serape!
[23:02] <03Quaker> Before they break up, someone offers Wilson a sombrero and serape. 
[23:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Seriously?
[23:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He looks at the Ambassador. Is this a joke?
[23:02] <03Quaker> Cav and KJ should still be wearing theirs, if they didn’t turn them down…
[23:03] <03Crion> 4Cav is, and shrugs.
[23:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Well, as long as he's not the only one.
01[23:03] <03banana> 6KJ is taking every opportunity to twirl around in it, frankly.
[23:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Just as long as nobody's wearing fake moustaches. There are limits.
01[23:04] <03banana> "What do you think it will be like to meet a 'princess'?" She opens one of the limo's back doors a fraction before the doorman can get to it.
[23:05] <03Crion> "Thank you." 4Cav will slide into the backseat.
[23:05] <03Quaker> Abby waves them off. Are they all taking the offered limo together? The Ambassador did make a special request about staying together while they were in the city, for safety purposes. The driver holds the door open, ashamed of his lateness. 
[23:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's getting in. You don't take the serape and then turn down the limo ride.
[23:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm trying to keep an open mind on this princess business."
[23:08] <03Crion> 4They appear to be all going together, yes.
01[23:08] <03banana> 6KJ: "Okienka sounded positive on the concept, but she would."
[23:09] <03Crion> 4Once inside: "So San Diego isn't what I expected."
01[23:10] <03banana> "All we've seen is Gannon and a bunch of ceremonial observers. Give it time."
01[23:10] <03banana> 6It's unclear whether KJ is referring to mariachi or to nosferatu."
[23:10] <03Quaker> The driver politely puts up the partition, and helps put everything else away in the trunk. 
[23:11] <03Crion> "You'd think the ten-foot tall masked creeps in robes would make the tourist guides, is all I'm saying."
01[23:12] <03banana> 6KJ: "Masked? I didn't get a good look. Was it the same one?"
[23:14] <03Crion> "About ten of them, dressed head to toe in black robes -- like judges -- wearing masks like the ones the Ambassador offered Wilson. Just standing there, not moving." 4He shakes his head again. "It's weird, though. It wasn't like Obfuscate. Okay, it was LIKE Obfuscate. But it wasn't that."
[23:14] <03Quaker> Soon, the limo pulls out of the parking lot and into the freeway. They can see the huge, dark bays again as they head to the northwest. Eventually, the suburbs thin out. The driver pulls off onto the side streets after a while, and they can see the roads begin to be lined with huge cypresses and oaks. The houses here seem to be bigger and further apart. As they drive, it’s hard to get much of a look around because of the 
[23:14] <03Quaker> winding nature of the hills surrounding them. 
01[23:16] <03banana> 6Did we even end up taking the masks? If so, this is an opportunity- to Wilson: "You want we should throw these things out the window?"
[23:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He makes a face at the masks. "Are those for me?"
[23:19] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah. Presumably the stilts come later."
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson snorts.
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I get the idea, but I got it covered."
[23:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "So to speak."
[23:20] <03Crion> 4That IS all they're asking.
02[23:21] * Quits: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
01[23:22] <03banana> 6In that case, KJ takes one and leaves Cav with the other. "I'm sure we can find a better use for some fine porcelain.
01[23:22] <03banana> "
03[23:22] * Joins: mattbaby (chatzilla@sorcery-c1cl4r.dc.comcast.net)
[23:24] <03Quaker> The limo clears one last estate’s gate as they turn onto a series of switchbacks, and then they’re in the clear, the brush around them stretching away into darkness. The intercom cracks: “Just a few more minutes until we arrive.” 
[23:24] <03Crion> 4This is really out there.
[23:24] <03Quaker> They’re pretty high up, too, though the gentle inclines have disguised their ascent. 
01[23:25] <03banana> 6KJ sounds a little more serious: "For better or worse, coming and going from this place will have us.. associated in peoples' minds. Let's see if we can make that into a good thing."
[23:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10If she really is the princess of La Jolla, at least she'll have a place on the beach.
[23:26] <03Crion> 4Cav: "First things first. Let's make sure there's no fairy-tale monster ruling the grounds."
[23:27] <03Crion> "It's been that kind of town so far."
01[23:29] <03banana> 6KJ: "No what I'm saying is that if so, we basically have to make friends."
[23:30] <03Quaker> The car pulls up to a large iron gate, waiting only for a moment as it parts. Once inside, the land around them levels off, plateauing for at least a mile in each direction. As they drive through, the landscape changes from rough chapparal to manicured lawns, fields, hedges, and garden plots. They can see statues and fountains, occasionally. If they roll the windows down, the smell of lavender will come to their noses, and 
[23:30] <03Quaker> they’ll realize that the main causewway is flanked on both sides by half-acres of the flowers. 
01[23:31] <03banana> 6In the language of flowers.. that means shit just got real.
[23:32] <03Crion> 4Too much land.
[23:32] <03Crion> 4Cav's a city kid. This is too wide open.
[23:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Blythe's place is nicer.
01[23:33] <03banana> 6Well it's a 'princedom', right? KJ folds up her serape and slips it inside her jacket, puts something like a game face on. The game of friendsmanship.
[23:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10When you play the game of friends, you either win or it's sort of awkward.
[23:34] <03Quaker> Eventually, the limo stops in a large gravel driveway. The land here is cupped like an ampitheater, the gardens and fields leading down to a central estate of many wings and an ornate architecture. A huge staircase dominates the front, and the driveway is lined with servants and helpers. Beyond, the land curves so that the entirety of La Jolla is exposed to their view; a huge, glittering semi-circle stretching to either side of 
[23:34] <03Quaker> the horizon bounded only by the black ocean beyond. 
[23:34] <03Quaker> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/On_a_bright_Summer_day_%2829869670216%29.jpg/1280px-On_a_bright_Summer_day_%2829869670216%29.jpg
[23:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10That's definitely what you picture when you picture 'the home of the Princess La Jolla'.
[23:36] <03Crion> 4No matter how rich he's gotten, the aesthetics of the really, really old, really, really rich are still off-putting.
[23:42] <03Quaker> When the limo pulls up, they can see that the entrance staircase has been decorated with wreaths of flowers and reams of white silk ribbons. A hand-painted wooden sign reads: WELCOME HONORED GUESTS. As soon as the engine turns off, servants are taking their luggage discreetly around the back. On the staircase are two women, one dressed in a black dress, white collar, and top hat, the other in an extremely comfortable looking 
[23:42] <03Quaker> ballroom dress of white silk with flowers pinned to its sides. 
[23:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's on board so far.
[23:44] <03Crion> 4Weird, beautiful henchmen does seem to be his wheelhouse.
[23:44] <03Crion> 4Let's see if the Princess has any mountain lions, though.
[23:45] <03Quaker> A trumpet player lets loose a blast from a balcony. The announcement afterwards is in Spanish. “Presenting, for the pleasure of the Princess La Jolla Elena Solano y Medina: Wilson Frost, Baron of Hollywood. Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna Beach. K.J. Valentine, Baron of Anaheim.” The servants applaud after each name. 
[23:48] <03Quaker> How seriously do the three of them take it? 
[23:48] <03Crion> 4Quite.
[23:48] <03Crion> 4What's that old saying, it doesn't matter if you believe in God, but if God believes in you?
[23:49] <03Crion> 4Wait. Maybe that was from a Disney movie.
[23:49] <03Crion> 4Point is: not gonna be rude to a host with this much pull.
[23:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson pulls off the sarape with a clank. He's wearing a burnished gray breastplate over the puffy vest. He was wearing it, in retrospect, the entire time. Beneath the sombrero he's got a misshapen and alarmed-looking golden mask.
01[23:50] <03banana> 6You don't waste a good spotlight. KJ sets the now-gauche serape aside as she steps out of the limo and stands for a moment with her hands in her pockets watching the top of the stairs; she bows once her name's called and starts upward to be presented for the pleasure of the Princess.
01[23:50] <03banana> http://i.imgur.com/tJ8ysve.jpg
[23:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson slides out of the limo and bows at the announcement, going up the stairs afterwards.
[23:55] <03Quaker> She doesn’t look particularly fearsome, anyway. The Princess, as the one in the white silk dress appears to be, waits for them to ascend to the second level of the staircase, inclining her head as they each make it up. A mastiff sits in a relaxed manner by the feet of the woman in a top hat. After they all arrive, the latter speaks first, in a surprising rasp. 
[23:58] <03Quaker> “Greetings, honored guests. We are honored to host friends of our family. I am Dona Eva de la Campa, the Princess’s second. I trust you have all traveled and arrived without incident? One small matter - do any of you not speak Spanish? We will assign you help fluent in the language of your choosing during your stay here.” 
[23:59] <03Crion> 4Cav indicates he's fine in Spanish, even though his player isn't.
Session Time: Sun Aug 27 00:00:00 2017
[00:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson doesn't indicate he needs help with Spanish.
01[00:02] <03banana> 6KJ: "My Spanish is poor, Dona. I've only brought one assistant, so thank you very much for the consideration."
[00:05] <03Quaker> Dona Eva keeps it in English, then. “Of course. We are delighted to help the envoys of the Princess’s brother-in-law in any way we can.” Another trumpet blast sounds from somewhere on a balcony. “Elena Ignacia Figueroa de Solano y Medina, Princess La Jolla.” 
[00:06] <03Quaker> The Princess puts out a small hand, palm down. 
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson takes her hand gently and bows.
[00:10] <03Crion> 4Cav's bow has a bit more of a flourish to it, but basically the same thing.
01[00:10] <03banana> 6KJ takes the princess's hand and bows in turn. She's not dressed for a curtsy.
01[00:11] <03banana> 6What's her aura like, though?
[00:12] <03Quaker> She doesn’t make any effort to hide her emotional state. It’s a cloud of light blue with whorls of pink and lavender. 
[00:18] <03Quaker> The Princess waits patiently until the formalities have been observed. Then: “Baron Frost, I do not endorse the backwards custom of Nosferatu masking themselves. Please do not imagine that anything except your own comfort may demand that you wear one in this house.” She draws a shawl around her shoulders. “Chilly, isn’t it? Let’s go into the atrium. Eva, could you have everything brought to us there?” Her English has
[00:18] <03Quaker> no discernible accent, and leads them further into the house as she speaks. 
[00:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Oh, whew. Wilson takes the mask off.
[00:19] <03Crion> 4Cav, murmuring: "Guess that means no stilts."
[00:21] <03Quaker> Quickly, they pass through a grand entry hall with black and white marble floors, heavy wooden furniture, and stone busts of distinguished ancestors. Through a set of double doors, she stops them in a large enclosed garden, walled off with glass and wrought-iron transparent sliding doors. The space is filled with beds of flowers, comfortable looking chairs, overhanging oak boughs, and the sound of running water from several 
[00:21] <03Quaker> fountains. Above, there is no roof. 
[00:23] <03Crion> 4Nice.
[00:23] <03Crion> 4God, the work all this must take to maintain.
01[00:24] <03banana> 6It's all wealth creation, right?
[00:24] <03Quaker> Eva reappears flanked by servants holding silver plates full of hors d’oeuvres, placed on a nearby table, and flutes of champagne. Discreetly, small cards with the wine list printed on them are pressed into your hands. The Princess sits you all in a circle, a flat stone table between you. 
[00:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Ehhh. He shouldn't.
[00:27] <03Crion> 4Oh hell yes.
[00:27] <03Crion> 4See, this is what you get when you travel inside your head with a coworker to feed yourself your own blood so that you don't kill you.
[00:27] <03Crion> 4Wine, anytime.
01[00:29] <03banana> 6Argh. Well, just this once. "I'm already impressed,"6 says KJ as the pallor fades from her skin. "We're further from smog than you can get within the Brilliant Court's limits."
[00:30] <03Quaker> After the servants have left, Eva takes a seat by herself on a fountain’s stone base. The Princess sips champagne slowly. “We have blood, as well, of course. Though I ask that you imbibe privately.” She rests her elbow on a pillow and leans forward. “So. I imagine that traveling to a foreign city, while your Prince leaves the city and your enemies remain free to plot against you, has made this assignment more stressful 
[00:30] <03Quaker> than you would like.” 
[00:31] <03Crion> 4Cav grimaces. "I'm sure at least in my case the Court feels the vacation is mutual."
01[00:32] <03banana> "Could be worse. It could have been a less beautiful city."
[00:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "I'm enjoying myself immensely."
[00:36] <03Crion> 4Cav: "But then, if my enemies want my territory they're welcome to it. It's brought me nothing but scheduling conflicts."
[00:37] <03Crion> 4This is not entirely true, nor would it be the way he'd present the matter in discussion with said enemies.
[00:37] <03Quaker> “I’m very glad to hear it. I hope that I can provide you with some peace of mind that you would not usually find during your stay here.” She looks at Cav. “I’m not so sure. A Shepherd is useful to have as a friend and servant. And as your distance from your master increases, so your utility to him decreases. Of course, it’s been a long time since I knew a Shepherd.” 
[00:38] <03Crion> 4He smiles. "So our kind made down here, too, have we?"
01[00:39] <03banana> 6Or perhaps La Jolla flies around the world. It certainly looks like it could.
[00:39] <03Quaker> “Decades ago. A man named Peter Holymount.” 
[00:39] <03Quaker> “Do you know him?” 
[00:40] <03Crion> 4The smile stays just as smooth and charming. "He's my grandsire."
[00:41] <03Quaker> “Are you fond of him?” 
[00:44] <03Crion> "We have a working relationship," 4Cav said. "Peter likes to say it's his policy not to fraternize with the junior associates."
[00:50] <03Quaker> She cannot read the intention behind the careful phrasing. “We had our differences of opinion. I knew your sire as well, Baron Frost. Though, we only met a few times.” She sips her champagne. “My apologies, Baron Valentine. I don’t mean to make it seem as if you are less pedigreed by comparison.” 
[00:52] <03Quaker> “Though I hardly consider pedigree a merit. It is less than useless, most of the time.” 
01[00:52] <03banana> 6KJ beams. "It's not an issue. When a mad cult induct you forcibly into the Requiem, it's best to see that as a learning opportunity."
[00:52] <03Crion> 4Agreed.
01[00:53] <03banana> "Who you know tells you just one thing: who you know. That's absolutely crucial."
[00:54] <03Quaker> “You all fought in the late, brief war, yes?” 
[00:54] <03Crion> 4The smile tightens up into a bit more of a grimace. "We all did our parts."
[00:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yes ma'am."
01[00:56] <03banana> 6KJ: "Sure. To make sure it was brief."
[00:58] <03Quaker> “What a pity, that any of you were imperiled so that something so pointless could be brought to an end.” She shifts in her chair. “Surely it is a great sin to engineer stupid things for people to die in. Of course, my little fief had no part in that. You should know that no one here is holding some bitter grudge against your presence.” 
[01:01] <03Crion> 4Engineering stupid things for people to die in might fairly be said to be the field expertise of both Barons Laguna Beach and Anaheim. Baron Hollywood is involved in far more noble things, such as reality television.
[01:02] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It wasn't personal. I can't say that makes it better or worse."
01[01:03] <03banana> 
[01:03] <03Crion> 4Cav: "It was slightly personal. For some."
01[01:04] <03banana> 6Of course the war was stupid. It was a war. Vampires are still going to have them, aren't they? That's who we are. "We'll all be happy to put the thing aside. Is the city recovering well?"
[01:06] <03Quaker> The Princess smiles. “No, not at all. The wounds it suffers from were not inflicted by the war, nor did the war address anything beyond someone learning that foreign adventures are not a healthy outlet for impatience.” 
[01:08] <03Crion> "Especially unprofitable ones," 4Cav says.
01[01:08] <03banana> "Intriguing. Literally. Who is it that would profit from patience?"
01[01:09] <03banana> 6It's been a long time since KJ had wine. She doesn't really have the palate to tell whether this is as expensive as everything else around the place.
[01:12] <03Quaker> “Better for them that it was unprofitable. If, by some unfortunate accident it had been succesful, the wrong lesson would have been learned.” The Princess hands her flute to a servant and replaces it with a wine glass. “It depends on whose patience you are considering. Iago Morales’s? The Carmelites?” She smiles. “Mine? Different answers for each.” 
[01:13] <03Crion> 4Cav: "No one profits from patience. That's sort of baked into the concept: profit is change. But that doesn't make all change profitable. And holy wars haven't sold well in oh, four hundred years."
[01:14] <03Quaker> “Hmm.” She looks into a fountain. “It is an unfortunate habit, speaking in circles. It only grows worse the longer you spend in a position as elevated as mine. Please, remind me if I am anything less than direct during your stay.” To Cav: “They sell well to those who spend all their time fantasizing of ways to make it as if it were 400 years ago.” 
[01:15] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Yeah. Well. Let's just hope they don't send me into any more office buildings."
01[01:16] <03banana> 6Since we're being direct- "Office buildings? What did they have you do, Laguna?"
[01:18] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh: "There were some complications in shutting down our embassy. I helped uncomplicate them."
[01:20] <03Quaker> The Princess: “And now? What are your plans for yourselves, after the war?” 
[01:21] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Housekeeping."
[01:21] <03Crion> "The Brilliant Court has, like all big, old organizations, has internal political fault lines."
[01:22] <03Crion> "They're all starting to rub up against each other now, for whatever reason."
01[01:22] <03banana> 6KJ: "I've been learning to shoot skeet. It's a nice change from Perl."
[01:22] <03Crion> 4He sips his wine. It's really a very good red. "Among other things, that's why it's so odd for the Prince to be out of town now."
[01:23] <03Quaker> “Yes. Bren and the others dissatisfied with the rate of their ascension into the highest ranks of power.” 
[01:24] <03Quaker> “Your Prince can act recklessly. Of course, when sucessful, it makes him appear omniscient. But it’s harder to fool those who remember him before he possessed his current position.” 
03[01:24] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[01:24] <03Crion> 4...Man.
[01:24] <03Crion> 4Everyone's so old out here.
[01:25] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You knew him before he was Prince?"
[01:27] <03Quaker> The Princess plays with the fringe of her shawl. “Oh, yes. When I met him, he was little more than an undistinguished enforcer-of-an-enforcer. That must have been in the 1880s. But he learned quickly. As I said, pedigree is a fantasy.” 
01[01:28] <03banana> 6KJ: "Do you have any scandalous century-old gossip?"
[01:29] <03Crion> 4So that's where she knows Peter from, or part of it. She was out here when the Shepherds were founded.
[01:36] <03Quaker> “I don’t think I’ve had enough wine for that. Hm. This may be an odd question, but…I’m always pressed for time, it seems. How would you characterize the situation in the former Orange Territory, with regards to its recently legitimized Carmelite population? Stable? Unstable? Fitting in well?” 
[01:36] <03Crion> 4Cav grimaced. "Too close for comfort. Both to open war, and to me."
[01:37] <03Quaker> “Open war with…?” 
[01:37] <03Crion> "My office was almost destroyed, and two Counts nearly set to war against each other, because of nonsense spiralling out of that."
[01:37] <03Crion> "A ghoul was, among other things, taking it upon himself to impersonate Donald Bren."
[01:38] <03Crion> "And using the territorial...uncertainty that surrounded the most recent redistricting -- the parcelling of Orange County -- to try and secure favorable real estate deals."
[01:38] <03Crion> 4He sighs. "It was a mess."
[01:39] <03Crion> "I am biased by distance, as I said, because the Carmelites are now my neighbors. But if I had to weigh in I'd say that they're ascendent, for now."
[01:40] <03Quaker> “I will assume that Bren and the others are opposed to them gaining any more territory at their expense.” 
[01:41] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Well, yes and no. The parcelling of Orange County was a massive win for Bren -- his holdings are now almost as extensive as the Prince's, if not moreso -- but that man wants infinite reach; he's probably muttering to himself about how much more territory he could have got without them.
[01:42] <03Quaker> She doesn’t hesitate. “And you are all opposed to any arrangement in which Bren realizes that reach, and replaces the current rulers of the city.” 
[01:44] <03Crion> "Which is ridiculous for two reasons; the first, that without the war as an impetus, Orange County might never have BEEN parcelled -- it might have become incorporated as a single territory within the Court, with its own Count and so on. The second, the war counted as a casualty the territory's administrator, H.H. Seabury, who might have taken a dimmer view to Bren's expansionism were 
[01:44] <03Crion> he otherwise alive and capable of objection."
01[01:45] <03banana> 6KJ: "I don't think there's a zero-sum game being played, Baron, Princess. Count Bren and the Prince have lived together this long - poor choice of words, but they could continue indefinitely."
[01:45] <03Crion> 4Cav sips his wine again. "I have a working relationship with Donald Bren."
[01:46] <03Crion> "But his further expansion would, I think, be a major problem for everyone in the Brilliant Court."
[01:46] <03Crion> 4He pauses. "Is Bren from San Diego originally?"
[01:47] <03Quaker> The Princess listens to KJ. “Do not mistake a fortunate longevity for a perfected system. Inertia can last for a very long time.” 
[01:48] <03Quaker> “He is not. I believe he spent some time here during the 1920s. But he comes from back East. Exactly where, I could not tell you.” 
[01:49] <03Crion> 4Cav: "I only ask because he shares your city's tradition of the robe and the mask for Nosferatu."
[01:49] <03Crion> "He's a bit shorter than they are, however."
[01:49] <03Crion> 4By way of explanation: "There were some of them out to meet us at the station. In their own way."
[01:51] <03Quaker> “They must be curious about your presence here. But they are not your enemies. Don’t be put off by their appearance. They have always been quite civil and restrained in all my dealings with them. Most are quite pious and soft-spoken up close.” 
[01:52] <03Quaker> “Bren is still wearing his mask?” She thinks. “That may be a private…joke. For him and a few others to understand.” 
[01:52] <03Crion> "Why are they so tall?" 4Cav swirled his glass. "Or is that impolite to ask?"
[01:53] <03Quaker> “It is their shared bloodlines. Some ancestor’s quirk, carried down.” 
[01:54] <03Crion> 4Cav shakes his head. "Must have a mean basketball team."
[01:54] <03Crion> 4Now Cav's imagining what the growth spurt that first night is like, and wishing he hadn't.
[01:55] <03Quaker> The Princess considers everything they’ve said for a while in silence while servants move around, refilling cups and trays. 
[01:55] <03Quaker> “I have an offer for you three, I think.” 
[01:56] <03Crion> 4And before his third glass, even.
[01:57] <03Quaker> “Are you in the mood for…complicating your vacation?” 
[01:58] <03Crion> 4Cav grins. "It was bound to happen eventually.
[01:58] <03Crion> "
01[01:58] <03banana> "We were were just talking about how change is inevitable." 6KJ's prepared to refuse if it comes to it, though. You can only have so much on your plate.
[02:00] <03Quaker> “Next week, the state security apparatus and associated church paramilitaries are preparing to liquidate more than forty Carmelites and their extended networks.” 
[02:00] <03Crion> 4These people just don't fucking learn, do they.
[02:01] <03Crion> "That's...a lot of people."
01[02:02] <03banana> 6Forty kindred? "So we get to stop the next war."
[02:02] <03Crion> 4That's gotta be almost the entire Sanctum in San Diego, but after a moment's reflection, this probably involves a cross-border raid into Mexico.
[02:03] <03Quaker> “Here is another fact: There exists a few routes maintained at the Grand Prince’s expense, used for clandestine movement of sensitive people and items between the Brilliant and Sublime Courts. Due to necessary security concerns, the people involved with them have little official contact with Court officials. The whole thing functions as a sort of no-questons asked delivery system. Flash your identification and whatever you 
[02:03] <03Quaker> like will be transported faithfully northwards. I’ve thought for a long time about how these two facts could be used to my advantage.” 
[02:04] <03Crion> "Like some kind of...railroad."
[02:05] <03Quaker> “The identification and authorization documents are kept under guard, and under constant surveillance, of course. They’re located in the Miramar Estate, the residence of the Grand Prince. Where you three will be, two nights from now.” 
01[02:06] <03banana> "Not the time for snark, Cav. Is this.. true? Not some sort of loyalty test? And if so, do you see the further separation of these populations as a way to de-escalate?"
[02:10] <03Quaker> The Princess laughs. “A test of your loyalty? No, I can only appeal to your self-interest. And no, I don’t see it as a path towards de-escalation. The opposite, in fact. I’d like to establish a base where the Carmelites can operate from in relative safety, running weapons south and people north as they need. In return, of course, they would remember the people who helped them. I imagine you could use fifty armed and 
[02:10] <03Quaker> incomparably trustworthy kindred owing you a favor. In any situation.” 
[02:10] <03Crion> 4That is a lot of kindred.
[02:11] <03Crion> 4Cav: "You want us to pull a heist."
[02:12] <03Quaker> The Princess: “Oh, yes. I would like you to rob the Grand Prince of San Diego blind, under the nose of the entire assembled Court as they dance and toast each other.”

[22:15] <03Quaker> -
[22:15] <03Quaker> -
[22:15] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHlHbRE4upU
[22:19] <03Quaker> Surrounded by the sounds of ocean waves rolling against the shore, a wooden roller coaster clattering empty along its tracks, and the soft blanket hum of carnival music, the three Barons have been given time to mull over the strange offer the Princess La Jolla has made them. She insisted that they enjoy themselves for the night while they think about it, so they’ve also been given the run of the carnival grounds at Belmont Park, which has 
[22:19] <03Quaker> been both kept open and cleared out of its normal late-night crowds. Sleepy looking employees check their phones, pinch their cheeks, and play with stuffed prizes in order to keep awake. 
[22:20] <03Quaker> The Princess and Eva have joined your little party, though they keep a respectful distance to let you talk amongst yourselves. Currently, they’re throwing rings at the necks of bottles at a stall. 
[22:21] <03Quaker> If any of this seemed strange….well, things are simpler when you own the place, Eva explained on the way down. 
[22:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This is surreal.
01[22:22] <03banana> 6Can we.. ride the rollercoaster?
01[22:22] <03banana> 6You know, for privacy.
[22:24] <03Quaker> It depends. Is KJ at least 4’11’’? That’s how tall you must be for this ride. 
[22:24] <03Crion|> 4Good lord.
01[22:27] <03banana> 6Please, she's easily five foot three.
01[22:27] <03banana> 6Two at minimum. "Okay, so.. okay."
01[22:27] <03banana> "Who just asks people they've barely met, want to do a cool heist and start a new war?"
[22:30] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Someone who wants a patsy to take the fall...or, someone so totally removed from mortal political concerns that they skip a couple steps in their recruitment process, since if they get it wrong they're so personally potent they can just kill you and start over."
[22:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Still, waste not want not. Wilson got some cotton candy. "She's an odd duck, but she's a sweetheart. There's a lot of those in these parts."
[22:32] <03Crion|> 4He shrugs. "Or someone who's being 100% forthright. West coast Invictus politics are bizarre."
[22:32] <03Crion|> 4"Sweetheart" might not be the word Cav would choose for the woman trying to kick off a holy war in a direction she prefers.
01[22:33] <03banana> 6KJ: "Could also have recognised us as people who could, frankly, get it done."
01[22:33] <03banana> "But like. Under what circumstances would we?"
[22:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He's not even eating the cotton candy. It just seemed like something to have. "If we saw the world the way she did, we'd all have already said yes."
01[22:37] <03banana> 6KJ looks wistfully at the little wooden cart, rattling around in the dark. "Right. The idea that it'd be better for the Carmelites if they had more guns and were pissed off about being recently evicted.."
01[22:37] <03banana> "Not that it's great for the local ones to be, instead, dead."
[22:37] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "I am not particularly pleased about that."
01[22:40] <03banana> 6KJ: "Eeaah. What if we warn the Court instead? Our Court. Get an urgent message sent, don't go ahead with the executions, fuck you, yours politely, the.. Prince who isn't here. Shit."
01[22:40] <03banana> 6Without Bailey around, who in Los Angeles would have the will and the authority to make that kind of statement? There's nobody, is there.
[22:41] <03Crion|> 4Nobody who would intervene on behalf of the Carmelites, at least.
[22:42] <03Crion|> 4Bren might -- might -- have the personal political sway, but he's also been a bit absent recently...and his interest would be in seeing the Carmelites destroyed.
[22:43] <03Crion|> 4But frankly, Cav suspects the powers that be in San Diego would look extremely unkindly on anyone from Los Angeles attempting to interfere with a San Diego pogrom as if it were their territory.
01[22:43] <03banana> 6Which is exactly what we're being asked to do. 
[22:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10'Who in Los Angeles has the will and the authority to do anything without Bailey around' is its own weird, thorny question even without the heist. "I wonder how many scripts you could get out of things the Princess does just because."
01[22:44] <03banana> "Yeah, this park answers some questions by itself!"
[22:45] <03Crion|> 4We're being asked to rob them sneakily. This is less insulting than what KJ is proposing, because it inherently shows we know we're in the wrong.
[22:49] <03Quaker> As the three Barons wander through the stalls and rides, all three notice them eventually. The tall figures, so tall that Cav thought they must be wearing stilts, dressed in black robes. In the night’s coastal mist, their white porcelain masks make them look even more ghostly. The Nosferatu stand far away, but they can be seen, peering through the latticed supports of roller coasters, or half-hidden behind canvas walls. 
01[22:52] <03banana> 6KJ: "Enough of that. I'm going to ask them what's up."
[22:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Something about the sight of them in the mist and their masks strikes Wilson very deeply. He doubles back to the Princess. "Should we be talking about this with those guys watching us?"
[22:53] <03Crion|> 4Oh, hello there.
[22:53] <03Crion|> 4How do they do that?
[22:54] <03Quaker> The Princess is watching Eva attempt to throw a mini-basketball through a tiny basket. “You will be working with them if you accept the offer. I think that they are trying to see how you move and speak.” 
01[22:55] <03banana> 6KJ: "So- fitfully, and with sudden decision."
01[23:00] <03banana> 6Which is the same way she moves into shadow, or into never having been present. Likely very familiar to the watching figures. But will they notice a woman approach, hands in her pockets, mind screaming lullabies?
[23:03] <03Crion|> 4Cav blinks and looks around. Wilson is still here at least, right?
[23:03] <03Quaker> This one doesn’t. As she closes on it, the mask remains fixed forward, watching Wilson and Cav. When she gets closer, KJ can see that the mask she thought was featureless is actually carefully and subtly decorated with shallow carvings. A single small blue gem hangs under its right eye. 
[23:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Over talking to the Princess. "Who's their leader?"
01[23:05] <03banana> 6Far faster than a mortal can move, KJ's outside of the park's public areas, under the canvas by the gem-masked pillar of a.. man? That or monster, depending on the mask.
01[23:05] <03banana> "Hey. You can watch, but what's your angle?"
[23:05] <03Crion|> 4Being the only one without Obfuscate can be incredibly jarring from time to time.
01[23:06] <03banana> 6Says the guy whose claws aren't visible.
[23:08] <03Quaker> La Jolla: “A man named Ferdinand. I don’t think he’ll appear here.” 
[23:11] <03Quaker> The robed figure doesn’t start. It does turn to look down at KJ in a smooth motion, though. “Oh…hello.” Its (his?) voice is suprisingly high-pitched and boyish. “…I guess I’m watching you to see what you’re like.” 
[23:14] <03Crion|> 4Cav's main concern is this: how does performing this heist, even to exact specification and plan, stop the San Diego court from carrying out its pogrom anyway?
01[23:15] <03banana> 6KJ: "Sure. Here's what I'm like: I want to understand things. Would you please tell me why you and your cohort want to help get these papers?"
[23:16] <03Crion|> 4He'll walk over and raise this question to the Princess directly.
01[23:16] <03banana> 6It might be more accurate to say that KJ wants to know things; she'll provide the understanding herself. But people don't react as well to that.
[23:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wonder why.
[23:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Would Ferdinand be involved in this? If we got caught, who besides us would get caught up?"
[23:19] <03Quaker> The robed figure inclines its head in a nod. “If we don’t, the lords and the priests will come for us and we won’t be able to stop them from killing our friends. But if we take those papers from the Great Prince, some of us can escape from this place.” He pauses. “Are you the spy?” 
[23:21] <03Quaker> La Jolla: “You will be given a duplicate set of papers. Forgeries, identical in every way except for the blood magic proving their authenticity. But the guards will not notice they have been replaced until it is too late. The ideal result is that no one notices the real papers are missing until we have moved those people who are in danger out of the city. Then, when they move, their hand will grasp at empty air.” 
[23:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "That could start a war."
[23:23] <03Quaker> “Ferdinand will only be involved in an indirect sense. You will see him at the gathering. Members of his clan will be more intimately involved. If you get caught, then as my guests, your capture and imprisonment will be my responsibility.” 
01[23:23] <03banana> 6KJ: "So it's you and yours. Fine. Please forgive the blunt question, but- why should we help you when it risks restarting a war which will kill even more people?"
[23:28] <03Quaker> La Jolla puts down the dart she was about to throw at a wall of balloons. “The war is ongoing. It may make things more uncomfortable between my court and yours, yes. But it will continue whether you choose to involve yourself or not, or whether your court sides with one side or the other.” 
[23:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "But then why should we, specifically, intervene?"
[23:30] <03Quaker> The robed figure stands, unsure. “The Princess…she has family where you come from, doesn’t she? Someone told me they’re very powerful. Wouldn’t they owe you a favor?” It stands silently. Then: “Please, help us. They’ll kill so many of us.” 
[23:31] <03Quaker> La Jolla: “Are you asking about your reward, or your court’s?” 
[23:32] <03Crion|> "It's not particularly about reward," 4says Cav. "At least not for me."
[23:32] <03Crion|> "It's about motive."
[23:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "It's not the reward, it's the punishment."
01[23:39] <03banana> 6KJ: "Don't worry, it's not on you personally to convince me. That'd be pretty unfair!" 6Although some people might say that when you stand around gazing eerily at people it's gonna invite deep, upsetting questions. 
[23:39] <03Quaker> The Princess shifts her coat with a shrug of her shoulders. “Things are accelerating in San Diego. Soon there will not be any disguising the irreconcilable contradictions between its various factions. There is no historical reason why Iago Morales must remain Grand Prince for eternity. As things shift and change, everyone must choose who they would like to see in power, and act on that preference. As for your punishment…The greatest 
[23:39] <03Quaker> consequences would not fall on you, if you fail. Unless you fail so objectly you’re killed outright by the guards in the attempt.” 
[23:39] <03Quaker> abjectly* 
01[23:39] <03banana> 6KJ stands with her shoulders hunched a little, watching the people out in the open alongside the watcher who's watching her. 
[23:40] <03Quaker> The robed figure watches with her. “We’re supposed to impersonate you while you work. So that no one notices you’re missing from the party.” 
[23:41] <03Crion|> 4Interesting.
01[23:42] <03banana> 6KJ: "That's actually a little worrying. As a group, we bank on inimitability."
01[23:42] <03banana> "So what happens if you and fifty other Kindred of San Diego just.. get together tonight or tomorrow or the night after and all leave town in a convoy? Are they really that prepared and that ready to act in the open?"
03[23:45] * Joins: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com)
[23:46] <03Quaker> The robed figure: “Um…they watch the roads leading out of here. And…I don’t think your Court would like that, us just arriving all at once in the open. I think that this way, we’ll stay hidden for a while. I think that we have friends up north who will hide us from everyone.” 
[23:47] <03Crion|> 4Cav's found his motive: 50 new Carmelites means the balance of power swings heavily in LA...and Cav's already allies, for better or worse, with the Carmelites.
[23:47] <03Crion|> 4At the very least, the secret police won't be pleased.
[23:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Right, but who do they befall?"
01[23:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "They wouldn't like it, but neither Laguna Beach nor the Orange Parish would stop you from entering. Please keep it in mind in case you run out of options."
[23:50] <03Quaker> La Jolla: “I will face the greatest consequences. And the people who serve my household. As soon as the charade ends, and I’ve returned you safely to your city without carrying out my duty of keeping you imprisoned.” She smiles. “Which is why you should succeed.” 
[23:51] <03Crion|> 4Cav will probably have some questions to answer either way.
[23:51] <03Quaker> “Of course, there is no telling who this might eventually touch. But I do not plan on washing my hands of anyone if things go less than well.” 
[23:53] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "...I'm in."
[23:53] <03Crion|> "I can't speak for anyone but myself, however."
01[23:54] <03banana> 6KJ: "Looks like I'd better intervene. Thanks and good luck!" 6She leaves the bleachers, possibly striding.
[23:55] <03Quaker> “Wait!” The robed figure calls after her. 
01[23:56] <03banana> "Yeah?" 6KJ turns, smiling, even though he called her a spy.
[23:58] <03Quaker> It’s as if the shadow of something overhead passes over the figure, and her mind leaves him for a second to try and see it. When she looks back, another KJ is there, standing by the metal supports. “See?” His voice is still that of a boy’s. 
Session Time: Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 2017
[00:01] <03Quaker> The Princess smiles. “Good. I’ll have the plans sent to your room.” 
01[00:03] <03banana> 6KJ: "Don't quit your night job."
[00:04] <03Quaker> The robed figure re-appears. “Okay.” 
01[00:04] <03banana> 6She hurries over to where Cavanaugh's found a way to fit this into the kind of politics he prefers. Does Wilson still seem chary of the expertly-downplayed downside?
[00:05] <03Quaker> Princess La Jolla turns to Wilson. “Baron Frost, walk with me for a moment. I have an additional incentive that I think you might be interested in.” 
[00:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson still doesn't like this. He will follow the Princess, though.
01[00:06] <03banana> 6To Cav (and Eve, presumably): "Why?"
[00:06] <03Quaker> She walks in silence for a while, leading him far down the beach. The last open stall on the boardwalk is soon left behind, and Wilson finds himself on an unlit stretch of wooden boards overlooking the sand. 
[00:07] <03Crion|> 4To KJ: "Why what?"
[00:07] <03Crion|> "Why am I in?"
[00:08] <03Crion|> "Because doing so is convenient for me politically, strengthens my allies and weakens the position of my adversaries."
[00:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson follows silently. This is a very moody place.
01[00:11] <03banana> 6KJ: "Is that an excuse? Fifty people purged, the kind of bloody massacre only people like us do these days in America. Are you sure you aren't ignoring the politics for some vestigial conscience?"
[00:13] <03Quaker> The Princess stops in front of a darkened candy shop and leans against the railing. “I have to ask: why are you so active, recently? I admit that my concerns down here mean that my impressions of situations up north lag behind a bit, but it was my understanding that you had withdrawn from most things.” 
[00:14] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Are you sure that you care?"
[00:15] <03Crion|> "Fifty Carmelites alive in LA rather than dead in San Diego is a win for me, both morally and politically."
01[00:16] <03banana> 6KJ, emphatically: "Yes. This isn't worth it if we aren't doing it for the right reasons."
[00:16] <03Quaker> KJ and Cav’s phones both buzz. There’s an email from Bryan Rush for Cav…and a text message from Morton Moreno Munoz for KJ. When did he get her number? 
[00:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson glances through the shop windows, half-expecting to see a masked face behind the glass. "You're right, I don't get out much. But I do always go where I'm told, and I've been told to go to more places recently. I don't know why, really. Those decisions happen over my head."
[00:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10This isn't the whole truth, but it is true, and it'll do for now.
01[00:17] <03banana> "There's an off chance that we fail and get wrecked. Decent risk that La Jolla is playing us in the first place. And a damn good chance that we do this, get home, start or don't start a war and then two-to-three of us get purged by our own people for doing this insane thing."
[00:17] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "How do you know?"
[00:18] <03Crion|> 4The baron crosses his arms. "Why are you so insistent this is going to start a war?"
01[00:19] <03banana> "Because doing so is convenient for Murray politically, strengthens her allies and weakens the position of her adversaries."
01[00:19] <03banana> 6KJ: "Who we'd be, now."
[00:19] <03Crion|> "Murray?"
01[00:20] <03banana> "You must be aware that the Baron of Palos Verdes is the one who keeps eyes on dangerous young Invictus to file them away as naughty or nice."
[00:21] <03Crion|> 4His eyes narrow. "Not all of them, Baron Anaheim."
[00:21] <03Quaker> The Princess looks at Wilson. “I don’t mean to make you remember something unpleasant. But I know you were more active during the 1970s.” 
[00:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Yeah."
01[00:23] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm not doing this unless we're doing it to stop dozens of.. naive believers in highly specific harmless religious dogma from getting murderd by dozens of vicious believers in slightly different dogma. I know Helena Murray is watching me; she told me so."
[00:24] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "And who are you watching?"
[00:25] <03Quaker> La Jolla shivers. “I heard how that ended, too.” She crosses her arm on the wood rail. “A few years later, I heard something else. I don’t think you have.” 
[00:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Okay."
01[00:26] <03banana> 6KJ: "My words, Cav."
01[00:26] <03banana> 6KJ: "You have to admit- if we do this- we're stupid for doing it."
[00:27] <03Crion|> 4A bit more lightly: "Oh, absolutely. Freely admitted; openly confessed-to."
01[00:28] <03banana> 6KJ slumps a little. "Okay."
01[00:29] <03banana> "I couldn't bring myself to take this risk if it was just more Invictus crap. I'll admit that right now but never again, okay?"
[00:29] <03Crion|> 4Cav grins. "Works for me. Let's go give Wilson the good news, then do something very stupid to save a whole bunch of lives."
[00:34] <03Quaker> La Jolla: “My sisters and I still talk. It’s good for us. Sometimes we let secrets slip out, sometimes not by mistake. It’s a way of unburdening yourself. My middle sister told me something once. A noble lady was discovered to be aiding the Carthian movement in Los Angeles. She was accordingly sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out. That’s the part that you’ve heard. What I heard, is that the evidence was never genuine. 
[00:34] <03Quaker> And that the sentence was only carried out on a convincing fake. And that only a few people knew that part. The Prince. My sister. The executioner. The noble lady. And the person the noble lady worked for. The lady’s childe, who discovered and reported the evidence, never knew.” 
[00:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "What."
[00:39] <03Quaker> The Princess: “I don’t know where the noble lady went afterwards. But I have a name for the one who put all that in motion. I’ll give it to you, if you help me. As well as the support of my family in whatever struggle you encounter back home. But that was already on the table.” 
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's jaw works silently.
[00:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I don't want to know."
[00:45] <03Quaker> The Princess looks surprised. “Why?” 
[00:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Respectfully, Your Highness, you don't need to convince me. I'm one of three. If you got them, you got me too. Like a sale at the grocer."
[00:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Let's get back under the lamps. People will think we're conspiring."
01[00:51] <03banana> 6KJ, gloomily: "Here they come now."
01[00:51] <03banana> "I can still see Wilson, so it must have gone well-asterisk."
[00:51] <03Quaker> Elena considers Wilson for a while. “Okay.” She starts to walk back. “I have never liked the feeling of being used by others. I try to keep my dealings straightforward.” A few stalls pass by. “I apologize for dangling it in front of you. If you’d ever like to know, ask sometime and I will answer.” 
[00:52] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Oh, don't sound so dour."
[00:52] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson, whose throat is closed off, just nods.
[00:52] <03Crion|> "Once we're actually there, stealing things, you're going to be having fun."
[00:54] <03Quaker> The Princess and the Baron get back to the others.
01[00:55] <03banana> "That's quite an accusation," 6she says, visibly enjoying going fast quietly.
[00:55] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Nothing I can prove in court."
[00:55] <03Crion|> "If we're lucky."
[00:55] <03Crion|> "And good."
[00:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "So what's the verdict? Are you two in?"
01[00:56] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yes, yes. Ugh."
[00:56] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yup."
[00:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "And there it is."
[00:57] <03Crion|> 4Cav discreetly checks his phone.
01[00:57] <03banana> 6Good idea. KJ checks her visible phone- there was a message earlier, right.
01[01:01] <03banana> "We'll have to do this right, though. The impersonators are skilled but they won't hold up a conversation- which event were we thinking of using? We'd better prearrange with Gannon to have some excuse to be separate and uncommunicative."
[01:03] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Or we may want me to stay and work the crowd while you two do the heisting. My skillset is uh, mostly about being seen and heard."
[01:04] <03Quaker> Subject Line: Irregular Inquiry Reported. Mr Cavanaugh — I just received the routine monthly report from the Judex’s office. Most of it is pretty boring, to be truthful, so few pay close attention. Included in one of the appendices is a record of all public records access requests made in the Court. I was going over the records to confirm that your heir designation was up to date and saw something strange. The office of Baron Bill Burne 
[01:04] <03Quaker> inquired about the heir of every noble in the Court at the same time. I thought it was strange, and knew you have had past unpleasant dealings with the Baron, so I’ve made a note of it and am passing the information on to you. Yours Respectfully, [etc.]” 
[01:05] <03Crion|> 4Fucking hell.
[01:06] <03Quaker> KJ has multiple texts from the same number. “GOOD EVENING BARON THIS IS MORTON MORENO MUNOZ WE HAVE MET SEVERAL TIMES DO YOU REMEMBER THE PARTY THROWN BY BARON GANNON LAST SPRING I WAS IN ATTENDANCE YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH MY WORK AS COURT HARPY THOUGH I OF COURSE FIND THE TERM QUITE” the text ends. 
[01:07] <03Crion|> 4He pops open his e-mail app. <Bryan-- You were right to inform me. Please let me know when anything else involving Burne crosses our desk. I will want to meet with you and Brian either tonight or early next evening re: working strategy for monitoring and response. --CC>
01[01:07] <03banana> 6That gets a blink.
[01:08] <03Crion|> 4Pause.
[01:09] <03Crion|> <Also, thank you for your discernment and attention to detail. It is very appreciated. --CC>
[01:10] <03Quaker> The second one continues: “QUITE IN BAD TASTE I STRIVE TO UPHOLD ITS NOBLE FUNCTION OF PASSING ON USEFUL SOCIAL INFORMATION TO WORTHY NOBLES TO BETTER SERVE THE GREATER HARMONY OF SOCIETY. I HOPE YOU DO NOT FIND IT TOO FORWARD THAT I CONSIDER YOU WORTHY OF MY PURELY FRIENDLY ATTENTION AND GOODWILL. IN ANY CASE I HEARD YOUR NAME MENTIONED IN PASSING BY THE JUDEX SUSAIN RAINEY HAVE YOU MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE SHE IS QUITE PLEASANT COMPANY IN 
[01:10] <03Quaker> ANY CASE SHE FOUND IT ODD THAT YOUR OFFICIAL LISTED DUTY HAD BEEN ALTERED WITH LITTLE NOTICE SPECIFICALLY YOU ARE NO LONGER LISTED AS WORKING FOR BARON MURRAY.” 
[01:13] <03Quaker> “I AM OF COURSE AWARE OF THE BARON’S REPUTATION AS SOMEONE INVOLVED WITH SENSITIVE WORK AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF SPREADING THIS INFORMATION FURTHER BUT THINKING FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT I THOUGHT IT MAY PREFIGURE SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AND SO WISHED TO MAKE YOU AWARE. I HOPE YOU ARE IN GOOD HEALTH AND MOOD. RESPECTFULLY MORTON MORENO MUNOZ ILLUSTRATOR FOR THE PRINCE.” 
01[01:13] <03banana> 6KJ: "Yeah, that could be how we.. excuse me, this is actually- just a minute."
[01:14] <03Quaker> “POST SCRIPT ADDITIONALLY AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE PLEASE VISIT MY ESTATE I HAVE ALSO HEARD OF YOUR INTEREST IN SHALL WE SAY THE STRANGER PATHS OF OUR SHARED LIFE STRIKE THAT NO NEED TO BE COY THE OCCULT AND I HAVE A BLEND OF A FAVOR TO ASK AND AN OFFER TO MAKE I HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON BEST WISHES ONCE MORE.” 
[01:16] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yeah, just a moment please."

[01:18] <03Crion|> 4Is the unstated end of that sentence.
01[01:19] <03banana> 6KJ Valentine, texting: <It's a pleasure to hear from you Baron Moreno Munoz 🙇‍♀️ The work you unveiled at Abby's party was quite striking, and who doesn't appreciate being kept up to date? 📅>
01[01:23] <03banana> <Hopefully Judex Rainey's information is just a delayed update, as it's true that I'm now looking out 😨 for Anaheim instead of assigned to assist Baron Murray. However, sudden changes are always a bit odd and I very much appreciate your update. Once I've returned from San Diego 🚆 I'll accept your invitation and I'm sure we can explore some of those stranger paths!>
[01:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's just standing around.
[01:25] <03Quaker> The Princess: “Test your strength while they answer their email?” She points to a nearby bell and hammer. 
[01:25] <03Crion|> 4For his benefit, then: "The office of Bill Burne just pulled every single heir listed on public record."
[01:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "Seriously?"
[01:27] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Yep. Buchanon noticed it while doing some remote work."
[01:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Jesus."
01[01:27] <03banana> 6KJ: "Strange, isn't it? The timing."
[01:27] <03Crion|> 4Cav isn't sure what that MEANS yet, but it can't mean anything good.
01[01:27] <03banana> "I mean not 'strange' so much as 'terrifying' but you know."
01[01:31] <03banana> "Burne isn't a guy who does anything of his own initiative."
[01:31] <03Crion|> 4Cav: "Certainly not records requests."
[01:32] <03Crion|> "And I'm sure there was a point to doing it publicly, too."
01[01:33] <03banana> 6KJ: "You're out of town. The Prince is out of town. Who else.. you know what? We can't get distracted by this yet." 
01[01:34] <03banana> "We're going to have to let the chips fall in L.A. There's a chance everything is connected, but even otherwise, we won't succeed here if we don't focus."
[01:34] <03Crion|> 4She's right.

[01:41] <03Quaker> Eva clears her throat. “Shall I call the driver? I think you three have had a long enough night. We can go over the plans in detail tomorrow evening. The night after next, we’ll set out for Miramar.” 
[01:41] <03Crion|> 4Sounds good to Cav. Where are they staying again?
[01:42] <03Quaker> Back in La Jolla, at the Princess’s estate. 
[01:45] <03Quaker> The limousine takes them away from the beach and the carnival, back up into the hills and the grand estate. The rest of the night, the barons are left to their own devices in palatial guest houses. 
[01:49] <03Quaker> Two nights later, the three Barons are told to dress in armor and report to the palace’s driveway. The drive to Miramar takes about an hour and a half, far past the lights of downtown, far into the endless hill and canyons of San Diego County. There are fewer trees than the wilds of back home down here…until they reach a small, wealthy community near a lake. 
[01:50] <03Quaker> The lake is fringed with willows, elms, and cypresses, obscuring dozens of grand manors and modern palaces. At the far end, something incredible stands illuminated. 
02[01:51] * Quits: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com) (Client exited)
[01:54] <03Quaker> Rising from the edge of the waters is a huge castle-manor, its turrets and towers bristling with miniature battlements, constructed out of gleaming white marble. Searchlights illuminate its surface, and from the other side of the lake they can see swarms of people milling about in its great courtyard. From its highest tower, they can hear bells chime to mark midnight. 
[01:56] <03Quaker> The Princess La Jolla descends from a truck, armored in a deep scarlet plate. Eva’s is a pale yellow. Behind them are two dozen retainers all in plate, all in shades of red, weapons all sheathed. “Shall we?” 
[01:56] <03Crion|> 4Jesus.
[01:58] <03Quaker> A fleet of rowboats takes you all across the water, the retainers doing the pulling, undead physiques keeping their manicured appearances perfectly still. The great house looms higher as you approach, and the sound of conversation and music gets louder. You can see a sea of armor on the other side. 
[01:59] <03Quaker> As the boats make their way past a short jetty and pull up next to a launch and staircase, a trumpeter sounds a high note from a balcony. 
[02:00] <03Quaker> You hear someone cry out above the noise: “Arriving, Elena Ignacia Figueroa de Solano y Medina, Princess La Jolla! Her retinue!” 
[02:02] <03Quaker> “Her guests, Baron Clinton Cavanaugh! Baron K.J. Valentine! Baron Wilson Frost! From the Brilliant Court, representing His Highness Whitaker Kingsland Bailey, Prince of Los Angeles! Welcome all! Miramar Castle and its master, the Grand Prince Iago Morales, Master of San Diego and all its territories, welcome you!” 
[02:02] <03Quaker> Three hundred pairs of eyes turn to look at you.

[01:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's before lunchtime, on one of those early spring days where it rains in fits. There's a lot of weather like that in this part of the Threshold. The clouds are tinged red by the star they obscure, and people are still talking about all the bad news that keeps trickling in: the fall of Thon, the mysterious absence of Council proclamations, the increasing visibility of Lookshyan soldiers 
[01:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> in the city, the honey and its prisoners, and of course, the death of the Emissary.

[01:16] <03Crion> 14Lookshy. An ironic name, really.
[01:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> Stranger woke up this morning to the sound of a steady drip-drip-drip on the polished stone floor of the hideout. There's a leak somewhere, hard to see and hard to patch because the place is earthenwork. Mud and Straw's a genius, but it's hard to figure out how to handle maintenance now that he's gone back north.
[01:22] <03Crion> 14Unhelpful, too, that Xu Sim's experiments are so...active.
[01:22] <03Crion> 14Far too much wear and tear on a building they've only been in for what, a few weeks now?
[01:22] <03Crion> 14If that?
[01:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> Probably. It's been scarcely more than a month since the Emissary died.
[01:24] <03Crion> 14Well, Stranger's course is clear.
[01:24] <03Crion> 14He walks out to the common area and puts on a kettle of water for tea.
[01:26] <03Crion> 14Stranger restocked yesterday, but he'll stick with the Forest Blackleaf as he sits down to think.
[01:26] <03Crion> 14Doesn't seem to be anyone else about at the moment, so he has the cozy area to himself...and that drip.
[01:26] <03Crion> 14Once he's finished his cup, he's decided it's time to do something about that.
[01:31] <03Crion> 14First things first: he needs to locate the guildhouses. All good craftsman are in guilds, and only some of those guilds are in the Guild.
[01:32] <03Crion> 14He'd prefer not to draw their attention yet again so soon after the incident with Cathak Tsuka.
[01:34] <03Crion> 14The main question is how to find those, without having to go through the Guild itself. Because that's a bit what it's there for.
[01:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> Guild guildhouses tend to hang their shingles in Nexus's prosperous and fast-moving downtown. Local carpenters, masons, and so forth keep smaller, private practices sprinkled throughout the city's residential neighborhoods. Higher-end (and more expensive) contractors set up in the rich neighborhoods flanking Parko Llana while humbler folk work in the neighborhoods at the foot of Sentinel 
[01:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> Hill.
[01:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> Chosen craftsmen (which is to say, almost exclusively, dragonblooded craftsmen) virtually all work for the Guild, and the ones that don't tend to head private practices downtown. But you never know. You can find anything in Nexus, so they say.
[01:36] <03Crion> 14Humility is a virtue -- but an even better virtue is its closest brother, discretion.
[01:37] <03Crion> 14Stranger will start in Sentinel Hill, then move on to Parko Llana and, if absolutely necessary, finally venture downtown.
[01:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> Stranger spends a fair bit of the day, into the afternoon, looking around for people who might be amenable to his work. It's an all-but-impossible needle to thread, though: people in the working-class neighborhoods hate the Guild and the Anathema both, people in the richer neighborhoods don't mind Anathema but Stranger realizes most of them are angling to get bought out by the Guild, 
[01:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> and the contractors downtown hate the Guild fiercely, don't care about Anathema, but wouldn't be caught dead in Floodwater.
[01:47] <03Crion> 14So it goes. But the search is worth it.
[01:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> Downtown is where he finds his best lead, from the apprentice working under a stern Earth Aspect master mason who's been tapped to screen prospective clients. How oblique is Stranger about his parameters? Would a socially inept teen be able to tell that Stranger wanted someone who didn't want to sell out, wasn't repulsed by the poor, and isn't frightened by the risk of association with 
[01:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> Anathema when there's a Wyld Hunt in town?
[01:51] <03Crion> 14That depends on how trustworthy and virtuous Stranger finds the teen.
[01:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> He seems too earnest and frankly dense to be duplicitous. Stranger sees him thumbing a locket stuck on the end of prayer beads. It only takes a brief conversation to identify him as a mama's boy, gone into the workforce out of necessity because his father passed. Not the kind of worker Stranger's after, but, the kind of kid Stranger can trust won't fuck him over.
[01:57] <03Crion> 14Then he is more than willing to be as indiscreet as necessarily up to just before the point of actually saying the word 'Anathema,' or identifying himself directly as one.
[02:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> The boy: "Oh, no, sorry. I don't think I can help you. That's quite a conundrum, sir." A half-grin, memory-spurred. "I guess there's always Old Selin. If you can find him."
[02:02] <03Crion> 14That raises an eyebrow. Selin is a rather common name -- but 'old?' Old coots that have been run off for their eccentricities are far more promising than young bucks trying to make their name.
[02:02] <03Crion> "Old Selin, hmm?" 14Stranger pauses as if thinking about it. "How old?"
[02:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh, I don't know. Master Fahad calls him Old Selin, and Master Fahad's over a hundred."
[02:05] <03Crion> 14Stranger supresses a smile. Yes, that's old enough to almost certainly have exalted blood in him. 
[02:05] <03Crion> "Say I did want to find Old Selin, then. Where would I begin?"
[02:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "When Master Fahad wants to hire him, he usually goes to the River Temple around evening bell. But it's raining, so he might be in the Undercity too."
[02:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Old Selin's a bum," says the kid with the confident obliviousness of someone who doesn't realize how rude that is.
[02:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "They give out dinner at the River Temple."
[02:09] <03Crion> 14Bless his heart. He's a good boy not to have opinions about bums.
[02:09] <03Crion> 14Stranger thanks him for his time and tips him, then begins planning the rest of his day.
[02:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> The River Temple is a joint monument to the three river mighty river gods who make their home in Nexus, the Maiden in Yellow, Grey, and Great Yanaze. Naturally, it's built right where the rivers merge. And there's dozens of ways into the Undercity, usually at streetcar junctions or along the canals.
[02:14] <03Crion> 14Ah. Grey. Memories.
[02:14] <03Crion> 14...Time to look for the soup kitchens, then.
[02:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> They're not hard to find. People ranging from the elderly to families with children eat at the temple. It's one of the bigger crowds Stranger's seen since coming to Nexus. Rare for so many people to mill around in one spot.
[02:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's not quite evening bell yet, so people are standing around, or sitting around. There's talking, and laughing, and some music, a couple scuffles, and a whole lot of quietly looking up at the temple waiting for the bells to chime.
[02:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> Big tureens are being set up under awnings on the temple steps, and there are huge lidded baskets lining the square in some effort to corral the trash.
[02:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> The rain's thinning out. What's Stranger's approach?
[02:21] <03Crion> 14Stranger probably looks poor enough that he can just blend in with the lines.
[02:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> While the rain is thinning out, it is still raining, and you'd think that this many people, at least some of them would be exposed to the rain. But standing in line Stranger notices he's stopped getting wet. He looks up to see broad canvas sheets taut like sails, bending the wind above everyone's heads and blowing the rain into the canal, the gutters and the alleyways, and... into 
[02:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> the inexplicably open windows of the Guild bank across the street from the temple.
[02:31] <03Crion> 14A water bank?
[02:32] <03Crion> 14He's heard of the concept in the South.
[02:32] <03Crion> 14But the climate here should render that, ah. Unprofitable.
[02:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> No, a regular bank. With like... papers and ink.
[02:32] <03Crion> 14How odd.
[02:33] <03Crion> 14He didn't want to get involved with the Guild as such, but...
[02:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> The bank's closed, so nobody's inside. Whoever opens up tomorrow is going to find the second and third floors all but ruined.
[02:33] <03Crion> 14Now there's a trick.
[02:33] <03Crion> 14A bit on-the-nose, however. There will be repurcussions for the soup kitchens -- even if they're mostly petty ones.
[02:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> Someone else is looking up at the bank windows, further ahead in the line. An old man in a knit cap, with a long, shaggy beard obscuring his long, thin neck.
[02:37] <03Crion> 14Stranger is now guessing that the whole 'guild-hating' thing is what got through to the young lad in his apprenticeship.
[02:37] <03Crion> 14He will not approach until after the man has gotten his food, and preferably he'll hang around long enough Stranger can get his as well.
[02:38] <03Crion> 14Soup kitchens can have excellent food, are noble enterprises, and he HAS spent all this time in line.
[02:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> The food here is good! A lot of people knock temple food because it's free, but, those people have never had temple food. Stranger gets a bowl of some kind of vegetable stew and a piece of bread.
[02:40] <03Crion> 4Now that reminds him of home.
[02:40] <03Crion> 14Now that reminds him of home.
[02:40] <03Crion> 14...Gary's home, at least.
[02:43] <03Crion> 14Once Stranger's gotten his food -- where's the old man?
[02:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> Stranger sees the old man sitting in a circle with several other old men in the light of temple lanterns. One of them unpacks a bag of polished stones and sets them out on the ground between the men as they eat and argue.
[02:43] <03Crion> 14He will walk over, then. Is there any obviously clear place to sit, if he wishes to invite himself in? And what's the deal with these stones, so he doesn't get blind-sided by some obscure riverman honor game?
[02:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> The old men are spaced out enough that there's places Stranger could sit without invading anyone's personal space. It takes him a moment since there's no board underneath, but he soon realizes that those polished stones are (fairly abstract) Gateway pieces. They're talking about a board position.
[02:50] <03Crion> 14Ah, Gateway. The preferred game of geniuses, real and imagined, for ages.
[02:51] <03Crion> 14Stranger has never given it much time or thought. How does the board position look?
[03:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's a mess. White has no good moves that Stranger can see, while Black's position is commanding. But the more he looks at it, trying to figure out how to win, the more precarious Black's position seems. Any of the obvious moves open Black up to devastating counterplay and a huge loss of material and position.
[03:04] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Storm's coming."
[03:05] <03Crion> 14Does he pass the eye test enough to just sit down without a challenge.
[03:05] <03Crion> *14?
[03:05] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I wouldn't bet on Black."
[03:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> Unless Stranger's bought more expensive-looking clothes than he wore into Nexus, the only thing that'd mark him out is the sword, if he's wearing it. Humble as it is, Stranger could eat for a month off what he'd get for selling it.
[03:07] <03Crion> 14He's not carrying a sword. He's carrying a cane, which they might be able to identify as splitting into a sword.
[03:07] <03Crion> 14And he hasn't washed the clothes in awhile.
[03:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> Then Stranger's probably fine. He gets the sense that this is pretty informal.
[03:11] <03Crion> 14He'll take a seat that's a respectful distance from the others -- not too close, not too far. What's his prospective guess at Old Selin up to? Has he already finished his stew and bread?
[03:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> Old Selin eats like a bird, picking at his food slowly while he argues with the others. Everyone else is trying to figure out Black's winning move, while Old Selin picks apart their strategies by outlining counterattacks.
[03:16] <03Crion> 14Stranger is content to watch, then. He's not equipped to engage in a battle of strategic wits with the old man -- at least not at Gateway -- and he somehow doubts the man would be all too impressed by a know-it-all showing up like this anyhow.
[03:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> The man Stranger suspects is Old Selin proposes a counterattack that gets the other men all conferring among themselves. This is when he notices Stranger. "Hello. It's nice to meet you."
[03:25] <03Crion> 14Stranger slightly bows his head. "You as well."
[03:25] <03Crion> "A Gateway player?"
[03:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sometimes. It gets people talking."
[03:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You?"
[03:26] <03Crion> 14Stranger shakes his head. "Sadly, no. It was not a respected pursuit where I grew up."
[03:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You're never too old to learn something new."
[03:28] <03Crion> 14The silver-haired man smiles. "True."
[03:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Where are you from? I haven't seen you around before."
[03:35] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I haven't been around much. I grew up on the banks of the Grey. Merchants, we were -- fishermen, mainly, but we had our fields to tend to as well. Stiff competition. Never went hungry, but routinely went poor. Gateway was...a Guild game."
[03:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> "That's the power of geography. Here, this game is one of the few things in Nexus the Guild doesn't own."
[03:37] <03Crion> 14Stranger nods and takes another bite of bread. When he's no longer speaking with his mouthful: "This is my first time up this way, however. I've been staying in Floodwater. Getting by. Doing well enough for myself, though still between work."
[03:38] <03Crion> "I like it there."
[03:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's nice. Bit quiet for my taste."
[03:39] <03Crion> 14Stranger nods again. "That's a good thing. When you want noise, you simply take a walk."
[03:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "True, true. What brought you out here? I hope it was the food. The food's worth it."
[03:41] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "No, the food merely convinced me to stay. Best soup kitchen I've eaten in, and I've eaten in a few. What brought me up here was a problem I had."
[03:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Oh?"
[03:41] <03Crion> "A problem with, oh, let's say, certain gentlemen."
[03:41] <03Crion> "They run a bank, among other things."
[03:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> The old man's mouth is full now, so he just nods for Stranger to continue.
[03:42] <03Crion> "But they don't run Floodwater. They have very little interest in it, frankly. I'd like that to continue."
[03:42] <03Crion> "Floodwater belongs in banks. Banks don't belong in Floodwater."
[03:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ha!"
[03:43] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Well, that's simple enough. There's nothing to sell there, and no one to sell it to. Keep the property values down, and you'll keep away the people who care about property values."
[03:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What's the saying? The river goes where the water flows."
[03:44] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "But no one knows when the Batcave closed."
[03:44] <03Crion> 14He elaborates: "It was a teahouse."
[03:45] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I'd say anyone who wanted to make life better there -- they'd have a tough balancing act to pull off."
[03:46] <03Crion> "New, useful building, without making it attractive to..." 14He waves a hand in the direction of the Guild bank. "You know."
[03:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Sounds like you'd want some construction work done."
[03:47] <03Crion> 14The silver-haired man nods. "Some. Discreetly. Good work; constant work. No money in it. Better things than money."
[03:48] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "A roof, a community. Food. I won't guarantee it's up to this standard, but cooked with feeling."
[03:48] <03Crion> "And a challenge."
[03:48] <03Crion> "You know what they say, after all."
[03:48] <03Crion> "You're only in trouble if you get caught."
[03:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ah."
[03:50] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You represent somebody?"
[03:51] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Myself. And Tepali, the local elder. We had a carpenter -- built a bridge, a fine bridge -- but he had to go away. Go North."
[03:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This sounds like something we should discuss further, out of the rain. You have a place?"
[03:54] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "That I do. Do you like tea?"
[03:54] <03Crion> "It's my only affectation."
[03:54] <03Crion> "Leaves are cheap when you grow them."
[03:54] <03Crion> 14He'll perhaps wait until they're away from the group before asking that.
[03:55] <03Crion> 14No need to hurt the man's street credibility.
[03:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I like tea. It's like Gateway, it's a good pretext for conversation."
[03:55] <03Crion> 14Wise man. "Very true."
[03:55] <03Crion> "...I never told you why I left the river Grey."
[03:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It's only my business when you decide to tell me."
[03:59] <03Crion> "It is your business straight-away, and it pertains to mine. A man came to town, from very, very, very far away. He killed my cousins, their wives, their children. I could not gainsay him. I could not defeat him." 14Stranger pauses meaningfully. "And then I could. I went from powerless, to powerful -- and in a very real sense, I still remained powerless. But now he cannot live in a 
[03:59] <03Crion> world with calenders...and that village is safer without me."
[03:59] <03Crion> "I tell you this in case it makes you uncomfortable. Such a change in a man."
[04:00] <03Crion> "I tell you freely I would understand if it did. It has made me."
[04:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You think power changes people?"
[04:00] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I think it is the only thing that changes people."
[04:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Maybe you're right. I've always thought it just makes them more themselves."
[04:06] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I think people will be good if you let them, and people will be bad if you make them. But many wise men see the obverse."
[04:06] <03Crion> "But I also think wealth is a particularly insidious form of coercion."
[04:07] <03Crion> "Which brings me back to this." 14Stranger gestures at the flooding bank as they pass it. "This is virtuous. But I strive for a place where it is not necessary."
[04:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Still, to see this and to have your first instinct be to help them. If we're to get philosophical, we might say that the tendency of virtue is to obsolete itself, and the tendency of vice is to stand fast and multiply."
[04:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> "People call me Selin. What do they call you?"
[04:15] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Trusting your first instinct is not the same thing as virtue. My first instinct was to find good tea. It could well be said to have also been my vice. And these all fit within your parameters -- but the trick, as I see it, is to enslave your vice, twist it, and then see that it multiplies. All the lives I've ever saved, I've saved over rich men's tea."
[04:16] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I am Stranger-Visits-Heaven. Hopefully you know me neither by my name, nor my works. There is no such thing as good publicity."
[04:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm not familiar. But I try to stay out of other people's business when I can. The Sun's especially."
[04:21] <03Crion> 14He grins. "Wise man."
[04:21] <03Crion> "Want to know my secret?"
[04:21] <03Crion> "So do I."
[04:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> Selin snorts. "So it goes."
[04:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What sorts of projects are you thinking of?"
[04:24] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Invisible things, to start with. Sewer projects. Underground works. Keep the waters down to manageable levels, but do not drain the place such that passersby might actually think of moving in to this brand new real estate. Alleviate flood season, for starters. There are very old, very ruined sluices, gates, and waterways to work with already -- high level things. A good 
[04:24] <03Crion> challenge, I'd think, especially if the people living there are covering for you."
[04:25] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "After that, community housing. Community workspacing. Things that are useful to real people, but, aheh, anathema to investors -- little privacy, little individuality, little resale value. Not shiny, but built for-purpose."
[04:26] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Finally, and most tenuously, direct above-ground infrastructure improvements. This is the most delicate of tasks, because it is the most visible and the most likely to be seized and turned into a toll serivce."
[04:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> "There are things we can do, if we've got the community behind us. But I should warn you, I can't do anything with the underlying architecture. I can redirect, I can siphon and sluice and shuffle, but the really old stuff is off-limits."
[04:27] <03Crion> 14He grimaces. "As much as I love fucking up the Guild's day, I'd prefer they remained too stupid to notice us."
[04:27] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "That's fine. Is that a council-level dictat or a mere fact of the architecture?"
[04:28] <03Crion> "I try to stay as unfamiliar with Nexus law as possible. It makes me more pleasant to be around."
[04:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Closer to the former."
[04:30] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "I have no problems with you setting your own limits on that front, both in general and with specific reference to Council Law, but if you see an opportunity to change something that you cannot change, do not hesitate to ask me what I can do to help. Because I have the power to bend ears, when I put my will towards it."
[04:32] <03Crion> 14He hesitates. "The last project is actually an offer, coupled with a personal request. We have a...common house in Floodwater. A hostel, if you will. For me and four other people like me. They do not all perfectly share my values, but they do not directly oppose them, and the five of us are a very potent power. I might not feel confident to make this offer alone -- but I am not 
[04:32] <03Crion> alone."
[04:33] <03Crion> "The offer is a room in this hostel, with everything that implies. You get a key, you pay no rent, you come and go as you please, you fend for yourself for food but the larder is usually stocked."
[04:33] <03Crion> "The request is that you plug a damnable leak we have somewhere in the upper crawlspace."
[04:33] <03Crion> "And other minor upkeep."
[04:34] <03Crion> "Obviously, you're not a cleaner, and while I don't think any of my colleagues are so rude as to demand such, feel free to deal with any requests from them as you see fit. I'll cover for you, so long as you're not being an asshole."
[04:35] <03Crion> "Or, if you prefer the streets, or some other venue, it is yours."
[04:35] <03Crion> "...But when you get a free moment, I would still ask for help with the leak."
[04:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> Selin considers this all. "I'll help, certainly. But I don't think I can accept your offer of lodging, though it is kind. You said there's a leak?"
[04:39] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "Drip drip drip."
[04:39] <03Crion> "It's a...high-intensity domicile."
[04:39] <03Crion> "We have a sorcerer."
[04:40] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Ah, so that's where Xu Sim's staying."
[04:40] <03Crion> 14He laughs at that.
[04:40] <03Crion> "Yes. Yes it is."
[04:41] <03Crion> "Everyone seems to know Xu Sim. How very complicated it's made our lives."
[04:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He's sharp, if inconstant. I had a friend like him a long time ago."
[04:43] <03Crion> 14Stranger: "His inconstancy is more boon than bust, I think. But it does make things interesting."

01[09:20] <03banana> The sun is rising over the desert. Spreading light reveals open-cut pits in the earth, great derricks and platforms, a complex of concrete painted flaking green and surrounded by radio towers.
01[09:22] <03banana> All the lights at Baikonur are off but for two buildings. One is a staff canteen where the tail-end of a party emits flickers of celebration and music which drifts over the empty launchpads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_aWGakJe4
01[09:26] <03banana> Around the other side of a missile test range is the secondary administration building, dedicated to Interkosmos - a hypothetical dream of cooperation which has yet to find any cooperators. They use it for now as storage and for this interrogation.
01[09:30] <03banana> There are two men from the Party, tired and ruffled by long hours of questioning. It seems to have worn more on them than their captive. In keeping with the Hegemonic Ministry's strange practices, one of them isn't even mistika - a mage. Otherwise there's no visible difference between them.
01[09:33] <03banana> The first man: "So you watched the rocket, without proper protective goggles. You saw its concealment from the eyes of America and God. And you say you saw.. something else, in that lack which should have been absolute."
01[09:33] <03banana> The second man: "Decreed free of information or perception."
01[09:37] <03banana> Days later on the other side of the Iron Curtain, Cleaner gets the news from the Brigadier-Sublime.
[09:38] <03Crion> 14What time is it?
01[09:41] <03banana> Comfortably post-prandial. You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.
[09:41] <03Crion> 14The fuck is a--
[09:41] <03Crion> 14Mid-afternoon?
01[09:42] <03banana> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."
01[09:42] <03banana> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."
01[09:45] <03banana> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.
[09:45] <03Crion> 14Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors. "My people."
[09:46] <03Crion> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." 14Cleaner uncrosses his legs.
[09:46] <03Crion> "So it goes."
01[09:46] <03banana> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.
[09:47] <03Crion> 14He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited. "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"
01[09:48] <03banana> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. 
[09:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. "That's all correct." 10Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.
01[09:50] <03banana> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't all be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.
[09:51] <03Crion> 14So as not to create any misperception of charity: "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."
[09:52] <03Quaker> 13It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. 1“Sorry,”13 he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in
[09:52] <03Quaker> white shirts and white shorts. 
01[09:57] <03banana> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."
01[09:58] <03banana> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."
[09:59] <03Crion> "Sounds bad." 14Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.
[09:59] <03Crion> 14He stands. "That be all?"
02[10:00] * Quits: hrolf_mac (hrolf_mac@sorcery-1fsqq1.cable.rogers.com) (Client exited)
01[10:01] <03banana> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"
01[10:05] <03banana> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.
[10:06] <03Crion> 14Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.
01[10:07] <03banana> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for the Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. "I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted 
[10:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> what I saw as another sun."
01[10:11] <03banana> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. 
01[10:11] <03banana> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."
01[10:14] <03banana> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."
[10:15] <03Quaker> 13Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. “Good evening.” 13The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. 
01[10:16] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.
01[10:17] <03banana> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"
01[10:17] <03banana> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."
01[10:17] <03banana> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."
01[10:17] <03banana> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."
01[10:21] <03banana> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. "I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."
01[10:22] <03banana> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."
01[10:22] <03banana> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"
[10:23] <03Quaker> 13Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. 
[10:23] <03Quaker> “So sorry. No speak English.” 
01[10:24] <03banana> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."
01[10:25] <03banana> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.
01[10:28] <03banana> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must not succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."
[10:28] <03Quaker> 13Mm. Well. She’s seen it before. If there were any danger, she’d know, as she’s seen him deal with it before. There isn’t, so they’ll both stand silently, waiting for the messenger to resolve itself into something meaningful. While he waits, he chews on his gum. 
01[10:29] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Second. Hegemon knew about this before the Tetrarchs, before your own hierarchy. Not the first time that's happened apparently. Needs to stop. As a matter of professional courtesy I won't try to estimate whether Panopticon might be riddled with spies."
01[10:30] <03banana> "Third. Have you ever heard of the Invisible Order?"
[10:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I feel driven to speak now for cooperation's sake." 10Perhaps unusual to the interrogators is that Epiphany hasn't once asked them a question. He has been the very model of incurious patience.
01[10:34] <03banana> Orient's brief patience bears fruit- maybe sensing its limit, the wrinkled prophet backs off a step and fixes him with a glare before speaking more firmly. "No good in the eyes of God, the Eye of the gods. We won't have a prayer as of four P.M. March third T minus zero. Our final warning, watchers watched."
[10:35] <03Crion> 14Cleaner never walked out.
[10:35] <03Crion> 14Ynkblot needs to learn to calm down.
01[10:35] <03banana> "You - two? you? - need to get your ass or asses to Florida several days too late to meet the man with the bird jacket, bird man, third man, triplly absurd man."
[10:35] <03Crion> 14He listens in silence, nodding and making non-comittal noises as appropriate.
01[10:36] <03banana> *triply
01[10:37] <03banana> First interrogator: "We always appreciate cooperation, comrade."
01[10:37] <03banana> Second interrogator: "It's all we can ask for."
01[10:40] <03banana> Second interrogator, after a brief pause: "The operation of the rocket engine upon the air, upon space itself. Describe its action again?"
[10:40] <03Quaker> “I see. Thank you.” 13Claudio wonders where in the world it was that the Eye had offended the God, if that’s what he meant. He’ll wait for the other man to stop before asking. “Do you have any specific dates or instructions?” 
[10:42] <03Quaker> 13In fact, he’ll look for them himself, in the man’s mind. How is it? 
01[10:49] <03banana> The prophet's mind is a mess. You can see the signs of deliberate damage - his mentality has been torn apart at some point, either by an enemy or the man himself. Probably best not to think about it? But in those ragged channels, there's something.. an entry point for divinity? He sees the future, and probably not of his own volition.
[10:50] <03Crion> 14Unsentimentally: "Pentacle cabal. Operate in Orange and Brevard Counties. Possible ties to Miami Consilium. Possible ties to." 14He doesn't trail off, just stops talking. After a short pause, he rephrases. "Interesting how they operate in our territory. Merits a closer look."
[10:50] <03Crion> "Noisy. Inconvenient."
[10:51] <03Quaker> 13That’s unfortunate. Claudio reaches out and brushes the man’s mind with a restorative intent. Does anything stop him? It would be a cruelty to make someone like this. 
01[10:53] <03banana> Prophet: "Go take a hike. Or a cruise. Can't lose. You can't lose if you invest in the Pharoah's Daughter, Yarmouth Line, out of George Town on Sunday and two weeks to Port Canaveral. Because of the market, you know, the devil you know, better to ride a boat than serve a meal."
01[10:53] <03banana> He freezes.
01[10:56] <03banana> The damage is deep enough that the original owner of this mind is effectively dead, but you can heal structure, impose something a bit more like regular function. Some of those tears close up. Shards of prophecy remain embedded like splinters, mental welts forming around them, but the patch job could last a long time, and he's old.
[10:56] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Epiphany: "As the report indicated, the primary device was an 11A57 functioning within parameters. All engines operational, no deviation in gross mass, normal burn time for all stages. There was an aberrant visual distortion, an apparent degradation of substance at the operant temperature, not in the rocket but in the air. If you asked me to be lyrical, it brought to mind a film

[10:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> "This distortion yielded to the astrosymbolic phenomenon I have already described."
01[10:58] <03banana> Ynkblot: "You'll probably get one. They've compromised the safehouse at Port Canaveral, threats of an attack. So item three is deal with that. We have names: Wildchurch, Cortex, Semiramus, Fixer. Perhaps Rockstar. We don't have descriptions."
[10:59] <03Crion> 14Fixer.

[10:59] <03Crion> "Any live contacts up there?"
[11:01] <03Quaker> 13Claudio will make the restorations as strong and deep as he can. Better - wait, two weeks to Florida? How many stops is it making? Isaias and his family are in Spain for the summer, so he’ll have to call tonight and let him know…”Thank you, my friend. Would you like anything for your troubles? We were just on our way to dinner. You’re welcome to join us. Or a hotel room, if you’d like.” 
03[11:01] * Joins: tom (tom@sorcery-mjfpi4.sub-70-210-142.myvzw.com)
01[11:01] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Oh, you'll have numbers on your side. At least five of Lewis's people and a few others in the area. The two thousand or so soldiers, scientists and journalists might get in the way."
[11:02] <03Crion> 14Cleaner just stares at him for a moment, then thinks better of clarifying that he meant informants or other privileged contacts, not mere lackeys. Instead: "Is this a kill order, a capture order, a scatter order, or my discretion?"
01[11:03] <03banana> The interrogators speak over each other for a moment. "Please do not be lyrical-" "An interesting image, but-"
01[11:03] <03banana> The first one resumes. "But a deviation did occur. Will you submit your memory for examination?"
01[11:07] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Cleaner, it's a desk job. This is a promotion. Administration. Your task will be to make everything run smoothly, and if that involves killing you can order yourself or others to do it. Again, I suggest Trajan there."
01[11:08] <03banana> "For handover on the local business - is there anyone you're tracking, ops in progress, anything Caveat doesn't have?"
[11:08] <03Crion> 14His discretion, then.
[11:08] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "No."
[11:08] <03Crion> 14To be more precise: "Caveat has everything."
[11:09] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Epiphany: "Would you accept a display instead?"
[11:10] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "Do I have a name for the one arriving at the Jetport?"
01[11:11] <03banana> The somewhat staggered prophet mumbles something about the offer of a meal. "Room? Plenty of room.. I've got a place, thanks. You've.. well, see you around, enjoy the trip." He's trying to concentrate on something he can no longer feel, figure out what to think instead..
01[11:12] <03banana> The two interrogators look at each other as weak light filters in from the Kazakh steppes. Perhaps years of dutiful service and the backing of Paternoster count for something. For this much, at least.
01[11:13] <03banana> "A simulacrum would be welcome, comrade." One of them gets ready to take notes. The other pulls down the blinds, to hide the intruding light and keep truths from the world.
01[11:14] <03banana> Ynkblot: "I'll send a couple of others with you as far as city limits in case those bastards are as well-informed as always. There should be a guy called Henrik and a guy called David."
[11:16] <03Crion> 14Cleaner notes that earlier Ynkblot had said there would be only one, and now he is saying there are two.
[11:16] <03Crion> 14He says nothing, though.
[11:16] <03Crion> 14Clearly the man has other skills.
01[11:16] <03banana> Looks like he's reading off some notes and perhaps not very carefully.
[11:17] <03Crion> "Understood." 14This time he'll wait patiently to be dismissed.
[11:18] <03Quaker> “Wait, wait-“ 13Claudio puts a hand on his shoulder to steady him. “Here, hold on…” 13He puts two fifty dollar bills in the man’s pocket. “Thank you.” 13He stands with the man until he’s collected himself. 
01[11:19] <03banana> The Thyrsus leading the Orlando incident response is accounted a Road-Builder on Foundations Immanent of the Georgian Tetrarchy and is (or was?) enough ranks above Cleaner to order him around totally regardless of Ministerial hierarchy, but yeah, he's not known for paperwork.
[11:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Now, the pharaoh statue comes to life. A produced pen-knife pricks the index finger of his left hand which draws patient script in red smears on the table. 4НИЧЕГО ИЗ НИЧЕГО 10When he's done, he licks the tip of his finger and then blows on the words, causing them to flare with white magnesium fire. Epiphany reaches into the flame and turns his hand palm-up. A 
[11:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10translucent image projects three-dimensionally in the air, the sight of a rocket launch, something burning, and something beyond.
01[11:28] <03banana> The vision goes on, and on. One of the men watches, rapt. The other makes it five seconds before he kicks over his chair and stumbles back against the closed blinds, seeming to melt into the fragments of light. Neither Epiphany nor the first interrogator have time to care. The dizzying sense of opened space - the incomprehensible beyond - and beyond the beyond, vast, ordinary yet impossible- 
01[11:29] <03banana> Within days he's on a plane to America, with a mission of comradely aid; strict admonitions not to speak; and a couple of strange farewells from unexpected persons.
[11:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How unexpected?
01[11:31] <03banana> One refers to 'our mutual friend with the white chains', which must be a strange definition of mutual. The other has well-wishes from quite a lot of colleagues who he hadn't thought cared enough to organise such a thing.
[11:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How thoughtful.
[11:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They must not expect him to return.
01[11:33] <03banana> Well, there's a lot of references from unpious fellow-priests to finding the American version of God.. 
01[11:35] <03banana> Ynkblot turned up again as Cleaner's escort, as well as Caveat and Endless Depths. The others are nervous, hanging around the great lighted cavern of the Orlando Jetport, with the sound of military planes outside but no civilian ones for forty minutes now. The specialists' plane is very late.
[11:36] <03Crion> 14He would have preferred to do this with Caveat or, ideally, alone. But he didn't voice that. Didn't seem like a useful discussion to have.
[11:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10There's no need to go searching. America prays to Saturn V.
01[11:37] <03banana> Outside is the tarmac, military dorms, and the highway - a straight shot east to Titusville and the Indian River. It won't be a long trip once these people actually turn up.
[11:37] <03Crion> 14Cleaner will have parked his car nearby, preferably inside the covered hanger so there's no need for the visitor to ever walk out in the open.
[11:39] <03Crion> 14He's in his civilian clothes now. Off-duty. Black mock turtleneck, charcoal blazer and slacks. Low-top black boots instead of leather shoes.
01[11:39] <03banana> Caveat stands close, saying nothing, reading a little pamphlet from some sort of philosopher. Endless Depths is down the concourse trying to persuade the Dunkin Donuts to sell one last round of coffee before closing. Ynkblot keeps looking up at the sky and complaining, as if it will stop the sun.
[11:39] <03Crion> 14Handgun in a shoulder holster under the blazer.
01[11:42] <03banana> From Henrik David's point of view his plane isn't late. Being able to leave at all is a minor miracle, let alone on this short notice; the small jet he's in doesn't *look* capable of international flights, and indeed according to the steward earlier this is not an international airport.
01[11:42] <03banana> There are just five other passengers, some probably Seers and some probably KGB. The plane's interior is mostly dark now that the sun is setting outside.
01[11:43] <03banana> America looks very large, below, and very open.
01[11:43] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Late, late, late. Do you think they got to the airline somehow?"
01[11:43] <03banana> "Can't be a damn coincidence that the thing's arriving at sunset."
[11:44] <03Crion> 14Apart from talking to Caveat readily whenever she asks and to the other two as much as they require of him, Cleaner will have been silent, leaning against either his car or another likely position, since they arrived.
[11:44] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik David closes his eyes and lets himself feel just the first breath of his relief and exultation before sealing it back up.
01[11:46] <03banana> Caveat's asked a lot of questions about the exact work Cleaner was doing in Orlando, to make sure she's got it straight to take over. She hasn't mentioned the space program once, but has let him see her scrying, trying to get a look at their colleagues on the Cape.
[11:47] <03Crion> 14He'll help her to whatever extent he can, but that's probably by staying out of it and staying in position to cover her. He's never had her talent or interest in the more...abstract arts of magic.
01[11:48] <03banana> The steward's back, handing Henrik a little plastic bag full of documents. "Sir, your passport and biography. Would you like Baikal or orange juice?"
[11:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Juice, please." 10Henrik's trying out his English; he considered trying to disguise his accent but abandoned the idea on the theory that no matter how he sounded, the Americans would assume his accent was Russian anyway.
01[11:52] <03banana> Endless Depths: "Shitwater, the good kind." He's carrying two cups and levitating two more in front of him, shielding them from view with his body - young, but stocky or even fat.
[11:52] <03Crion> 14Levitating.
[11:53] <03Crion> 14Cleaner doesn't sigh,
[11:53] <03Crion> *14Cleaner doesn't sigh.
01[11:53] <03banana> Caveat does! "Dumbass," she tells the other Obrimos, but takes a cup. Ynkblot doesn't seem to want one.
[11:53] <03Crion> 14He will take the offered coffee and nod thanks.
01[11:56] <03banana> The juice was not very fresh. It's almost dark outside and Henrik feels a little queasy as he carries his belongings down the steps from the small Sukhoi. There's nobody here, which is good because they seem to have landed on some sort of military base; the others, more experienced travellers, are already walking toward a modern looking Terminal building on the other side of the tarmac. 
01[11:57] <03banana> No stars visible above. A slightly sweet smell in the air. It's crisp, and in the distance he can hear the noise of cars. American cars.
01[11:58] <03banana> Ynkblot: "They're not waiting outside, at least. You've got the car ready? Depths, finish that shit and go set up for an escort."
[11:59] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "The car is ready."
[12:00] <03Crion> 14He'll glance over at Caveat when Ynkblot looks away. His expression is bland, but she'll be able to read it: exasperation at this sloppiness.
[12:00] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Mmm. It's good to be on solid ground.
01[12:00] <03banana> Incongruously, Cleaner hears birdcalls. The airport is full of trees, in pots and in little strips of earth, but he recognises Ynkblot's nimbus. Preparing for trouble.
[12:00] <03Crion> 14He unbuttons his blazer. Easy access to the gun.

01[12:01] <03banana> A week into the cruise of the S.S. Pharoah's Daughter, the matter of tickets arises. 
[12:02] <03Quaker> 13Hm? What? Claudio has to be woken up, since he’s fallen asleep on a chair on the top deck, half-covered by a quite dated newspaper. 
01[12:06] <03banana> They were sold when the Yarmouth Line vessel initially departed Port Canaveral, an opportunity Oriente didn't have access to as at the time was on a different continent. There might not be a need for him to wake, though- it's Isaias who's been cornered by the grifter.
01[12:07] <03banana> The man claims to be associated with the cruise company and he has a staff shirt. But the offer is unorthodox.
01[12:08] <03banana> In a little mid-deck hallway, between the cabins and a row of portholes by the ship's pool- "There's basically two ways to deal with your problem."
01[12:09] <03banana> The sailor smirks. He's sitting on an iron step, blocking the way past. "When we make landfall, there's the Brevard County Sheriff's Department. Or if it turns out you can afford the tickets after all - you and your friend look like you can afford things, one way or another - I can make this go away."
01[12:10] <03banana> Caveat moves closer to Cleaner. Looks like she's unarmed - not that she needs to be, but it always helps. 
01[12:11] <03banana> This doesn't seem to be a busy airport, though it's gleaming new. Henrik's anonymous fellow travellers bid him anonymous farewells at the unmanned gate, dispersing in various directions - he sees one lighted concourse with people at its end, a janitor moving along the wall between here and there. Everything is very modern and expensive.
[12:11] <03Crion> 14She knows pretty well by now that there's a loaded Smith & Wesson Model 27 with an extra quickloader of .357 in the glovebox of his car if she needs it. The window is rolled down.
[12:12] <03Crion> 14In addition to the Welrod in his camera bag under the front seat, and the AR-10 in the soft canvas long-bag in his trunk.
01[12:13] <03banana> They've all heard the plane landing at last. Ynkblot: "Hey, good luck over there. We need you back, but only when this one's in the ground."

[12:14] <03Quaker> 13Isaias isn’t dressed for relaxation. He’s a slight, thin man with a slight, thin face and dark skin. He looks rather like a shabby academic, in his tweed coat with patches on the elbows and his sweater vest. There’s a light sheen of sweat on his forehead, but it’s from the sun, not from anxiety. In fact, he doesn’t understand the man at all. “Claudio!” 13Orient snorts awake and looks around. 
01[12:15] <03banana> Sailor: <Incomprehensible american words, now sneering.>
[12:15] <03Quaker> 13Isaias asks, in Arabic: (What does this guy want?)
[12:17] <03Quaker> 13Orient walks over to the steps. “What’s this? Sorry, my friend here - no English. Is there a problem with something?” (Hold on.) 13That’s spoken in no language at all, just sent into Isaias’s mind. 
01[12:18] <03banana> Henrik sees three American mistika turning toward him, looking bored and relieved. The leader is a wiry but heavily-muscled man, a ranked Seer wearing spells of transformation and power almost visible to the Sleepers closing up shops nearby.
01[12:19] <03banana> The others are a woman, a pretty Obrimos with no obvious magic going on (but some magically concealed), and-
[12:21] <03Crion> 14A tall, vaguely handsome, intense but calm looking man who goes photo-negative when directly scryed and who is very obviously carrying a large-caliber semi-automatic handgun. He's standing closer to the woman than the...
[12:21] <03Crion> 14Cleaner's face doesn't show it, but he's wondering where Endless Depths has slipped off to.
01[12:23] <03banana> The Ministries signifiers and uniforms are different here - do they even have uniforms? Henrik isn't sure who's what, apart from the leader, who's scrutinizing him intently.
01[12:25] <03banana> Sailor, standing: "The jig's up, you know. I checked the passenger list against cabin allocations yesterday."
01[12:25] <03banana> "Now, we've got the easy way to do this- you speak good english? Cheap way, good. Or there's the cop way."
01[12:28] <03banana> Ynkblot glances behind him toward the carpark and then takes a few steps toward Henrik David. <Welcome,> he says in godawful Russian, <you must be cool space man. Here we have to go fucking fast>
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Here greeting the Americans is a man of average height, middle-aged and balding, broad at the shoulder, wearing a rumpled gray suit with a black greatcoat draped over his arm. He's got a single suitcase and his brow is ringed with burning white tattoos that almost but not quite seem to mean something. "Old friend," 10he says. There's no mistaking his accent. "You look very well. 
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> It's been what, three years?" 10I come in deference to you and on behalf of the Father.
01[12:29] <03banana> An engine revs- looks like Endless Depths is waiting in the other car.
[12:30] <03Crion> 14Cleaner doesn't shake his head. Communication.
[12:30] <03Quaker> “I speak English well. Could you explain your meaning in more detail? I purchased cabins for both of us until we reached Port Canaveral. (Shakedown for a few dollars. Don’t need to hurt him. Hey, could you check on the cat? I don’t want him to have to sit in the carrier if he vomited in it. I’ll take care of this.) 13Claudio fishes in his pocket for a cabin key and hands it to Isaias, who vaults over the railing and takes it. 
[12:30] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10He nods to each of the others and then follows their lead to the cars.
01[12:31] <03banana> Ynkblot, English: "What? Oh, hey. Nice to see you again, if that's what we're doing. Here, go with Cleaner, we'll be behind."
01[12:32] <03banana> Caveat: "Good to meet you, if brief."
[12:33] <03Crion> 14Cleaner looks the man up and down, and nods. Then he glances over at Caveat -- is she riding along with them or headed off on her own?
01[12:33] <03banana> She'll be going with Ynkblot and Depths- escorting you and then bank into town. Cleaner has her number, although he doesn't know what his own is going to be, wherever he's going to be staying.
[12:34] <03Crion> 14He doesn't appear disappointed by this. He nods to her in farewell, then says: "Passenger's side door is unlocked."
01[12:35] <03banana> Sailor: "Right, 'purchased' from someone on the dock who said he could get you in. No doubt. I can make this go away, don't worry."
[12:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik will follow Cleaner to the car, then. "Thank you. I should put the suitcase where?"
[12:35] <03Crion> 14He'll either take the man's suitcase to put in the trunk, let him do it, or let him keep it. Doesn't matter much to him.
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik will put it in the trunk himself. There's nothing bleeding or glowing in the trunk, is there?
01[12:37] <03banana> What does Cleaner's car look like? Endless Depths has an older Buick: http://i.imgur.com/A2GovXf.jpg
[12:37] <03Crion> 14Nope. Just a jack, some tools for changing a flat, a long soft brown canvas bag that has either golf clubs or a rifle in it (pretty easy to guess which), a carton of cigarettes that's half gone-through, and what looks like a box of ammunition.
01[12:38] <03banana> The sky is dark now as the barely-introduced mages leave the airport. "We'll be with you for a few miles," hollers Ynkblot. "Got some fuckers making trouble around here, they won't leave the city, don't worry about it comrade."
[12:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik will make sure not to squish the cigarettes and then get in the car.
01[12:38] <03banana> The converted air force base still has a long wire fence, though it's being torn down to give the new airport a real facade. Beyond are city lights, many low buildings and a great deal of new construction - Orlando is rising.
[12:39] <03Crion> 14This car, in Navy Blue http://playtoysclassiccars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/5884-Passenger-Front.jpg
[12:41] <03Crion> 14Cleaner pulls the car out park. "The most convenient name for you to know me by that isn't 'Cleaner' is Deputy Wayne Barrett of the Dade County Department of Public Safety, Sheriff's Office. Please open the glovebox, if you'd be so kind."
[12:41] <03Crion> *14out of park
[12:41] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik opens the glovebox.
[12:42] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "Sitting in front of you is a Smith & Wesson Model 27 .357 magnum, fully loaded, in a brown leather holster. Next to it is a quickloader with six additional magnum rounds loaded into it. This is yours for the duration of your stay in this country."
01[12:43] <03banana> The two Seer cars form a little convoy, threading their way out of carparks toward an enormous multilane highway which doesn't seem justified by the residential density on the other side. It's not very impressive as a war party, but between the five of them Cleaner's pretty sure they could handle even a large scale assault from the enemy.
[12:43] <03Crion> "Now, I'm aware that the Soviet Union is a fan of semi-automatic pistols. Have you ever held a revolver before?"
01[12:43] <03banana> You can just barely hear Endless Depths and Ynkblot arguing over their radio.
[12:43] <03Crion> 14He keeps half an ear on those two in case someone lights them up.
[12:44] <03Crion> 14Well, a little more than half an ear, when he remembers Caveat's in their car.
[12:45] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik David: "I have no training with firearms."
01[12:45] <03banana> Traffic's dropping off from rush hour levels. The roads are filled with trucks heading west to the Disney construction site and east to the Space Coast. Like you.
[12:46] <03Quaker> “Are you saying that my tickets are not legitimate?” 13Isaias disappears off towards the cabin deck. 
[12:47] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "That's fine. They're very simple. The most important thing to know about revolvers as distinguished from semi-automatic handguns is they do not have thumb or trigger safeties. That's why their holsters always cover the trigger, and said triggers have a heavier pull. You cock the hammer, you point, and you shoot. The release where your thumb rests wheels out the chamber 
[12:47] <03Crion> for reloading; that chamber then snaps back into place."
[12:47] <03Crion> 14He glances over at the Soviet seer. "I'm saying this not to sell you a handgun, but to make a point."
01[12:47] <03banana> Sailor: "I'm saying it won't cost much to make them legit. You've been enjoying these fine company resources - the steel below our legs, the dining and the entertainments and so on - and if you're prepared to pay up then when we make port you won't have to pay for it another way."
[12:48] <03Crion> "Anything you do with that--" 14He points at the glovebox with his free hand. "--in this country, I can fix."
[12:48] <03Crion> "Kill someone, threaten someone, or just beat them to death with it -- anything you do with that weapon, I can make it go away in the interest of a better working relationship."
[12:48] <03Quaker> 13Claudio nods. “Thank you for bringing this to my attention. What is your name?” 
[12:48] <03Crion> "You start throwing magic around like..." 14He glances at the radio. "...some people, well."
[12:49] <03Crion> "I have a much harder time cleaning that up."
[12:50] <03Crion> "If you prefer an automatic rifle, I've got one in the trunk."
[12:50] <03Crion> "Welcome to America."
01[12:50] <03banana> Orlando's dropping away rapidly, but the traffic isn't. Cars stretch out east toward the blue horizon and the intervening valley, lush with wet forest.
01[12:51] <03banana> In the distance, Henrik can see a bridge over a small river.
[12:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik closes the glovebox. "Thank you. Forgive me - you will be on the team assigned to Cape Canaveral?" 10He looks ahead out of the windshield.
01[12:51] <03banana> Gary: "Gary Sapp, fourth lieutenant." This rank does not exist. "And you're Saba and Kiflay. One cabin or two? Doesn't matter to me, you're entitled to zero."
[12:52] <03Crion> 14Cleaner follows at a respectable but steady distance. The good news about this four-door Impala is that it was requisitioned as a special plainclothes unit through the Sheriff's Office -- so under the hood, it's a police cruiser, with the reinforced frame and souped-up engine that goes along with that.
01[12:52] <03banana> "Tell you what. If you haven't got the cash on you yet, I could stump it up for you. That's my role on this vessel, smoothing over difficulties. We can settle it soon enough."
[12:53] <03Crion> 14Cleaner isn't visibly surprised that Henrik David turns down the gun. Usually they take it. At least he won't have to replace his backup. Either this guy's gonna make his life easier, or a whole lot harder.
[12:53] <03Crion> 14To Henrik David: "That I am."
[12:54] <03Quaker> “Two cabins. Thank you, but I can afford - how much was it, again?” 
[12:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik: "Has there been violence?"
[12:58] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "I am an Adept of Matter and a..." 14He pauses for a moment, blanking on the term. "...Apprentice of Death. I will be providing support."
[12:58] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "Not at the project site. Not that I've been briefed on."
01[12:58] <03banana> Gary: "You've only been on half the voyage so it seems fair to make it half, right? I'm guessing someone else left at Grand Cayman, got sick or whatever, hence the free cabins.. just twelve hundred, then."
[12:58] <03Crion> "The reason for all of this is the situation in Orlando."
[12:58] <03Crion> "It's fluid."
01[12:58] <03banana> Gary: "Would you like a receipt?"
01[13:00] <03banana> They come up out of the night, along the highway with roars which at first mix with the noise of the cars all around. Cleaner, driving the Impala at the back of the convoy, spots them in the rearview mirror before they're within handgun range. At least a dozen motorbikes and only one of them has a rider.
[13:01] <03Quaker> “Thank you, Lieutenant. If you could write one up afterwards, I would appreciate it. Let’s go see the captain about it.” 13Claudio shades his eyes and looks towards the bridge, and starts walking. 
[13:01] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "Henrik David, I need you to reach into the backseat. The middle partition of the bench seating pulls away. You can reach into the trunk. I need you to pull out the soft, long canvas bag you saw in there when stowing your suitcase."
01[13:02] <03banana> Gary: "Oh, sure. This way, he's down by the engine room."
[13:02] <03Crion> 14These people always have to fuck everything up so loud.
[13:02] <03Quaker> 1“Please, lead the way.” 13Claudio will follow the sailor. 
[13:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Of course." 10Henrik sees them too as he turns around in his seat. "Ah."
[13:03] <03Crion> "Just pull that bag out and lay it across the front console here. I'll need it in a minute."
01[13:03] <03banana> Henrik doesn't see the same thing when he turns around, of course.
[13:03] <03Crion> 14A slight smile tugs at the side of his mouth. "And the Model 27's still there if you've changed your mind."
01[13:04] <03banana> He sees a gang of bikers - the famous american motorcycle outlaws! They're riding in a wedge shape, taking up the road and forcing traffic to wait or move aside.
01[13:04] <03banana> They're mostly men, but on the front bike - VERY shiny chrome and a particularly loud engine - there's a woman clinging to the driver, wearing a little cap but with her hair streaming back in the wind.
01[13:04] <03banana> The man she's holding on to is the only one you can see in the mirrors.
01[13:05] <03banana> Caveat: [[It's that fucker again. Ynkblot says don't provoke. We're almost to the river and your mission is more important.]]
[13:06] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: [[Understood.]]
[13:07] <03Crion> 14He moves the bag down across his shins, out of sight of the passing bikers. She said not to provoke.
[13:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik: "From Orlando?"
[13:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Orlando is a fun word to say.
[13:07] <03Crion> 14Cleaner: "From Orlando." 14There's not a trace of exasperation in his voice.
01[13:08] <03banana> As the bikers pull alongside the Impala- several of them on each side and one riding ahead toward the Buick - their nature becomes more obvious. None of them are giving off body heat, and they radiate Death - the leading man strongly and the woman even more so.
[13:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "A threat display?"
01[13:08] <03banana> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQSGw0hMd_I
[13:08] <03Quaker> 13Well, if Gary has an accomplice wielding a wrench menacingly or something, Orient supposes that he can sit and talk as well. 
01[13:09] <03banana> Lead biker, enormously bearded, bellowing: "YALL HAVE REINFORCEMENTS NOW? NICE. NIICE."
[13:09] <03Crion> 14Cleaner reaches into his blazer pocket, pulls out his mirrored aviators, and slides them on.
[13:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik just sits back.
01[13:10] <03banana> Just a couple of minutes to the river. They shouldn't be able to cross.
01[13:11] <03banana> Biker: "We SAW your men on the plane and we SEE you, into your WRETCHED little souls." The others cackle and sing along to their obnoxious music.
[13:11] <03Crion> 14Conversationally, to Henrik David, not speaking up so the bikers can hear but not whispering or lowering his voice either: "Ever staked a vampire?"
[13:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I have not."
[13:11] <03Crion> "Don't recommend it, myself."
01[13:11] <03banana> When they hear the accent, the woman on the leader's bike whispers something to him.
[13:12] <03Crion> "Messier than you think."
01[13:12] <03banana> Biker: "Oh it gets MESSY boy."
01[13:12] <03banana> Biker "Looks like yall are on your way OUT of town which suits us just fine."
01[13:13] <03banana> Another biker, with a mohawk obviously: "And stay out!!"
[13:13] <03Crion> 14Cleaner, as they're almost on top of the bridge: "Be seeing you, Bishop."
[13:14] <03Crion> "Real soon now, y'hear?"
01[13:14] <03banana> They're peeling away reluctantly. Biker: "In HELL yeah you will."
01[13:14] <03banana> "And if you make it to hell first- you tell em BISHOP FLINT JUGULUM SENT YOU!"
01[13:14] <03banana> "This town belongs to the god damned SABBAT!"
[13:14] <03Crion> 14Flint Jugulum.
[13:14] <03Crion> 14Well.
[13:15] <03Crion> 14He has a name for the Bishop now.
01[13:16] <03banana> The vampires pull up in a long row by the side of the St Johns River, shadow gathering about them. By the time you're fifty metres away you can no longer see or hear the Sabbat pack, though the road and the traffic on the other side of the bridge are still clear.
[13:17] <03Crion> 14Cleaner sticks a hand out the window and gives them a peace sign with the back of his left hand as they drive over the bridge.
01[13:17] <03banana> On the edge of the forest is a rest stop, where Ynkblot's car pulls up. The others have to head back to town, though they'll likely take a different route in.
[13:17] <03Crion> 14Maybe the index finger comes up a second later than the middle.
01[13:18] <03banana> Endless Depths rolls down a window, gestures for you to stop a sec.
[13:18] <03Crion> 14Cleaner pulls over.
[13:18] <03Crion> 14Does he want Cleaner to pull window-to-window like cops do, or stop the engine and get out?
01[13:18] <03banana> Ynkblot leans out. Bits of black bark are flaking off his skin. "Sorry about that, comrade old friend!"
01[13:18] <03banana> He's yelling past Cleaner to Henrik David.
[13:19] <03Crion> 14Cleaner doesn't roll his eyes, even under the sunglasses.
01[13:19] <03banana> "We've been dealing with these assholes for months now. Fuck's sake, this should be a Camarilla problem but they've abandoned the area entirely."
[13:19] <03Crion> 14Those are apparently the tolerable sort of vampires. Cleaner wouldn't know.
01[13:21] <03banana> They have the Camarilla in Russia too, probably - it's hard to root the bloodsuckers out entirely, and anyway they've been around long enough to be one of the few credible forces that makes deals with the Iron Pyramid as a whole. These guys must be their offcuts and garbage.
[13:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "He claimed to be a Bishop. Is that unusual?"
[13:23] <03Crion> "Not for him."
[13:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Henrik is talking to Cleaner, since shouting past Cleaner would be rude.
[13:23] <03Crion> "Seems to be a title for their gang bosses. Flint Jugulum there is only one of them."
[13:24] <03Crion> 14To the other Seers: "Guy gave his name, if we didn't have it before. I didn't. Flint Jugulum."
[13:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10The more he says it, the more it sounds like a regular name.
01[13:24] <03banana> There's a hatchway to the side of the ship's rather noisy engine room which Orient hasn't seen open before. Inside is some sort of office alright- medical supplies and tins of food are stacked on shelves behind a man who is, indeed, wearing a captain's uniform. You don't recognise him, but how much attention were you paying?
01[13:25] <03banana> Ynkblot: "I don't want his name. I want his jugulum."
[13:25] <03Crion> 14Classic Ynkblot.
01[13:26] <03banana> Ynkblot: "Yeah, anyway, they can be dangerous. We'll get them. Until then probably don't cross the river without an escort, the damn Lasombra come out of nowhere."
01[13:26] <03banana> "Bishop guy himself is the dangerous one, though, and he hasn't got that power- doesn't matter, this isn't your job anymore."
[13:27] <03Quaker> 13Orient steps into the little office and nods. “Captain.” 
01[13:27] <03banana> Endless Depths tries to say something but he's kind of squashed behind the Thyrsus there. The night deepens.
01[13:27] <03banana> Caveat hasn't even rolled her window down, but kind of shrugs goodbye.
[13:27] <03Crion> 14Cleaner's nod to them is meant for her.
[13:28] <03Crion> 14Onto the safehouse, then.
01[13:28] <03banana> The ship's captain?: "Mr. Kapic. This is about the ticket payment? I'm glad you've decided to make the situation regular."
[13:28] <03Crion> 14Unless the werewolves want to chat next.
[13:30] <03Quaker> 13Is there a place to sit? “Yes. I don’t want to take advantage of your crew, of course. I am happy to pay my way.” 
01[13:31] <03banana> When the Impala starts up again you've got a much emptier road. The forest is dense and humid, but it's just twenty minutes before Cleaner and Henrik climb a ridge to see the sea, then the land, then the sea. On the island between the peninsular rivers is a wide expanse of roads, cleared land, military bases and little townships - and the launchpads. Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship. It's still some way to travel, but they're thirty-six stories tall and bright orange.
01[13:32] <03banana> There are actually no chairs in the supply office. There *is* a logbook of some kind, which the uniformed sailor pulls toward him and begins writing you out a receipt. "1200," Gary informs him. Presumably that's in american 'bucks'.
[13:34] <03Quaker> 13Orient nods and pulls out his wallet, counting out $1200 in bills. “And what was your name, Captain?” 
01[13:37] <03banana> "Call me Sam, Mr. Kapic. Have you been enjoying the cruise otherwise?"
01[13:38] <03banana> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.
[13:40] <03Quaker> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” 13Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. 
[13:44] <03Quaker> 13He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk. “Is this what you wanted?” 13he asks Sam. 
01[13:44] <03banana> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.
01[13:45] <03banana> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."
01[13:45] <03banana> Oddly, that one was almost true. 
[13:45] <03Quaker> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” 
01[13:51] <03banana> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."
01[13:52] <03banana> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.
[13:52] <03Quaker> 13Orient turns to Gary. “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” 
01[14:00] <03banana> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."
01[14:00] <03banana> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.
01[14:01] <03banana> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"
01[14:01] <03banana> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"
[14:01] <03Quaker> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” 
01[14:01] <03banana> It is very clear that Sam expected this.
01[14:02] <03banana> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."
01[14:02] <03banana> "Sorry about that, yeah?"
[14:03] <03Quaker> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” 
01[14:03] <03banana> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."
[14:06] <03Quaker> 13Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. “It’s alright, Sam. I don’t have any intention of turning you in. You can consider me a friend. I promise that I have your well-being in mind.” 
01[14:08] <03banana> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief. I thought.." He's kicking the fallen money into a little pile behind him. "Dunno what I thought. Fucking weird that Gary turned us in, though. Don't expect another share now, Gary."
01[14:09] <03banana> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."
[14:09] <03Quaker> “How long have you been running this scam?” 
01[14:10] <03banana> "Just a couple of years since Yarmouth opened out of Port Canaveral! There are always a few people who want a cheap ride back to the US of A. You know when it works really well?"
01[14:10] <03banana> Sam: "Shut up!"
01[14:11] <03banana> Gary: "It works really well when they don't have a visa either. The guy at the docks tells them it won't be checked at the point, and then I regret to inform them.."
01[14:11] <03banana> "I really do regret it, you know?"
01[14:11] <03banana> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.
[14:12] <03Quaker> “Sam, please! There’s no need for harsh language here. I imagine it works very well then, Gary. It sounds like it would work very well on very vulnerable people like that. I imagine they would be very scared.” 
01[14:12] <03banana> Sam: "Who are you?"
01[14:13] <03banana> He's got the presence of mind to be standing on the cash, at least. The ship creaks and turns a little, sending pills and bits of glass across the floor.
[14:14] <03Quaker> “I’m an importer-exporter, headed towards Florida to try and set up my business there. Before I decided to emigrate, I lived in Milan with my wife. Before I came to America, I was spending time with her on vacation. The nature of my work means that I won’t see her for quite some time.” 
[14:15] <03Quaker> Orient taps his wallet. “This was all the money I had on me. It was all I had to try and make a life for myself in America. You’ve taken about half. I don’t think my business would be able to survive on what I have left. I’m not sure what I would do if you kept it.” 
01[14:16] <03banana> Sam: "That's a real shame" and obviously completely true. "Best of luck with your uh, venture. I mean we're both businessmen here in a way, right."
01[14:16] <03banana> Gary: "Sam! We can't keep it, are you nuts?"
[14:17] <03Quaker> “No, we’re not both businessmen. I’m afraid that you’re trying to rationalize taking advantage of people. Do you think you’re doing that? Taking advantage of people just like you?” 
01[14:18] <03banana> Sam: "What, so some wop wants to start a business instead of going home to his wife and somehow that's our problem? This is America, or it will be in a couple of days."
01[14:18] <03banana> Gary: "The business thing isn't real, that's not the point, the point is you're being a dick-"
01[14:18] <03banana> Sam: "No, obviously it is- you want to make a charitable donation to some guy's commercial venture? What?? Are you an MBA now?"
[14:18] <03Quaker> 13Orient holds up a hand. “Hold on, Gary. It’s alright. You don’t need to insult Sam.” 
01[14:19] <03banana> Gary: "Oh, sure. As long as he gives the money back, though."
01[14:19] <03banana> Sam: "This is insane! You stole it in the first place, you talked him into giving it over!"
[14:20] <03Quaker> “Gary, I appreciate it. But please let me speak to Sam without interruption. I would really appreciate it. I know how much you must want to speak.” 
01[14:21] <03banana> Sam: "What have you done to us? You're so.. honest. I can't stop giving a shit about your vacation and your wife. Why would I give a shit?"
[14:21] <03Quaker> “Sam, sit down. I’m not going to try and make some sudden move for the money you’re worried about.” 
01[14:21] <03banana> Gary doesn't say anything, but he looks smug. Obviously he's pretty happy that you've pulled one over on him.
01[14:22] <03banana> Sam sits, then bends to the side and picks up the cash, putting it back on the table where it originally was. "Shit, nearly cut myself."
01[14:22] <03banana> "I'm going to have to clean all this up before the next supply drop.. quartermaster's supposed to keep a clean office. I can trust you with that, right? That I'm the quartermaster?"
[14:23] <03Quaker> “Yes, you can. How much money have you taken in with this scam?” 
01[14:25] <03banana> Sam: "Uh, I feel like it should be more.. we've got at least a couple dozen people, but the money always seems to go as fast as it comes in. All those bars on the islands, and the girls, you know. This is a great job, as long as you've got spending money."
01[14:25] <03banana> Gary: "Yeah, it is. I should've picked a better partner though."
[14:25] <03Quaker> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” 
01[14:27] <03banana> "Everything's at tourist prices. Lots of rich assholes on these cruises - present company excepted - if you think about it, we cheat the ones who're cheating themselves."
01[14:27] <03banana> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."
[14:28] <03Quaker> “Have all of your targets been rich? It seems like not all of them could be, or your threat of contacting the police wouldn’t be quite so powerful.” 
01[14:31] <03banana> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" 
01[14:31] <03banana> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."
01[14:32] <03banana> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.
[14:33] <03Quaker> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” 
[14:34] <03Quaker> 13Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? 
01[14:36] <03banana> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."
01[14:38] <03banana> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."
[14:38] <03Quaker> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful. But it also seems as if there are easier ways to find that. Ways that don’t involve hurting people like this. And it seems like for all the money, you both have rather severe reservations about what you find yourselves doing.” 
01[14:50] <03banana> Gary: "Maybe I shoulda been a magician."
[14:50] <03Quaker> 13Orient adjusts Sam. He feels a tinge of guilt. With a little bit more patience, with a little bit more persuasion, he could have secured the man’s express consent. But he doesn’t trust his own persuasiveness. Oh well. 
01[14:50] <03banana> Sam: "That sounds like actual work. Look, why don't we just-"
01[14:52] <03banana> Gary: "?" His former confederate has a one billion-yard stare.
01[14:52] <03banana> He's looking into a world where things can- must- be different.
01[14:53] <03banana> Sam shifts his chair back like the money in front of him is something repulsive, making a little squeaking noise. "Why don't we just.. find a better way. Find something, anything that doesn't do this to people."
[14:53] <03Quaker> “Magic shows sound like a healthy creative outlet, Gary. I think you should look into it.” 
[14:54] <03Quaker> “I think that’s for the best, Sam. Most people can’t enjoy money if they feel too guilty to use it.” 
01[14:54] <03banana> Gary: "That was just an idea, but-"
01[14:54] <03banana> Sam: "Any idea has to be better than this. It doesn't matter so much what *we* get out of it."
[14:55] <03Quaker> “I suspect you’ll get more out of it than you think.” 
01[14:55] <03banana> The man keeps shaking his head a little like he's trying to clear away an unpleasant noise or a clump of earwax. Unfortunately it's Most Of The Thoughts And Impulses He's Ever Had.
01[14:57] <03banana> Maybe it's the noise of surf against the becah.
01[14:57] <03banana> *beach
[14:57] <03Quaker> 13Orient stands up. “Well, I don’t want to keep you from your duties. Gary, Sam, I think that you two know as well as I do that your swindling days are over, and that we’re all glad that’s the case. May I take my money back?” 
01[14:58] <03banana> Gary: "Hey, I wasn't objecting." At least recently.
[14:58] <03Quaker> “Sam?” 
01[14:59] <03banana> "Yes! Yes. Um, good luck with your business. I really hope it isn't impacted by- are you gonna be ok?"
01[15:01] <03banana> Weird how most people just go through life hoping the world will get better instead of making it into a better place. It may take a lifetime to find out why.
[15:03] <03Quaker> “I’ll be fine.” 13Orient puts the money back in his wallet. “Are there any other people you’ve taken money from still on the ship? If there are, I suggest you return their money and apologize for the mistake. And I guarantee that you will feel richer afterwards. There is no amount of money that can replace the knowledge that in the truest sense, you try at all times to be a good person.” 13He shakes both their hands. “Thank
[15:03] <03Quaker> you for talking, Gary. Sam. I have complete confidence in both of you. I think that today will mark the beginning of a happier time in both of your lives.” 
01[15:05] <03banana> Gary happily and Sam with some trepidation shake, see their guest out, and start cleaning up the room and their acts. The guy on the dock sure is going to be disappointed.
[15:06] <03Quaker> 13Claudio returns to his cabin and knocks. Isaias answers, holding a sleeping orange tabby cat in the crook of his arm. They speak rapidly in Italian once Claudio closes the door behind him. 
[15:07] <03Quaker> (What did you do?) (Talked to one, had to tamper a bit with the empathy of the other.) (Did it cost you?) (A little. Nothing to worry about.) 
[15:08] <03Quaker> 13Isaias rolls his eyes. (He would have understood just as well if we had thrown him overboard.) 
01[15:09] <03banana> If more briefly.
[15:09] <03Quaker> 13Claudio shrugs. (I’m sure that my patience will run out sometime in the future. There will be occasions to act irresponsibly. Do you feel like a match of badminton? They put up a court on the uppermost deck.) 
01[15:10] <03banana> The Pharoah's Daughter steams onward, out of the Bahamas toward Florida coast. By the time it reaches Port Canaveral, it's too late- they've put men in space. But at least Orient will get to see what happens next.

[08:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12The scene: the top floor of an observation tower, devastated by supernatural combat. The walls, floor, and ceiling are alternately charred, shattered, or melted. Blood and demonic ichor stains what's left of the furniture, and pools most heavily around a mangled man in a robe who sits almost folded over against one of the walls.
[08:16] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I know how it looks but I swear we just got here."
[08:16] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Hi."
[08:16] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Shit."
[08:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12This is Azer'jol, a Lunar Exalt with a full moon burning on his brow. He's got the pale cast and dark robes of a Sijanese, and one of his arms and both of his legs are slowly reconstituting themselves out of an ever-thinning swarm of scarabs that surrounds him.
[08:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Separately, "Arakesh" the southern tyrant lizard trainer looks completely mortal and extremely alarmed. The Squared Circle is there in its entirety, including Ying, who's just arrived holding the hand of a tall figure in a white robe. The hood's up, and silver glints within the cowl.
[08:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10They're holding hands?
[08:18] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Aww.
[08:19] <03Crion> 4Moving pretty quick.
[08:19] <03dammitwho> 7They're holding hands? Wow.
[08:19] <03trenchfoot> 13You guys!!
[08:19] <03Crion> 4Just saying. Nice catch.
[08:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12They just were, anyway. The Emissary's pulling a gloved hand away now to idly flex it against his other hand. He's got a rich, aristocratic voice. "But surely not all of you just got here."
[08:20] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm gonna guess you know how I did."
[08:20] <03Crion> 4She's playing at some bravado here, hoping he can't see how tapped out she is.
[08:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "I did notice. But are you entirely uninvolved? Who can explain this?"
[08:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Is one of the Lunars stepping up?
[08:21] <03Crion> 4Ir doesn't say anything more. She's not sure what the legalities are here.
[08:21] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying's as confused as the Emissary is! This is a heck of a situation they've stumbled into.
[08:22] <03Crion> 4She does remember something about wanton violence, though.
[08:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek seems intent on playing the hapless mortal passer-by for the moment. Jol's where the Emissary's eyes(?) are eventually going to turn, though, and unless someone wants to jump in right now he'll be the one to answer.
[08:23] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It's wiser to back his play than try to talk over him, since we don't actually know what happened.
[08:23] <03Crion> 4Ir will resist the urge to glare at 'Arakesh.' She's peeved, not angry.
[08:23] <03Crion> 4And the Emissary doesn't need any more information about them than he already has.
[08:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "I... was attacked."
[08:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "Is that so? By whom?"
[08:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol glances around. He meets Marek's eyes briefly. Marek, very faintly, shrugs. So Jol takes a breath: "By agents of heaven. By-" 12After the fact, none of you remember the term he used.
[08:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10For his part, Eikichi has his arms folded, big billowy sleeves almost merging together and making him look like a bronze statue of an extremely attractive monk. Do you think he can hear us? 10Zantetsuken can pick this up.
[08:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12Zantetsuken: Absolutely not. The bond between soul and sword is sacrosanct. This... city bureaucrat is a nobody.
[08:27] <03Crion> "Agents of Heaven. Yeah." 4Ir bristles, not at anyone present but at the memory. "Friends of the guy I had to deal with in the arena."
[08:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> So... weak points?
[08:28] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "So that's what was going on! I saw 'em, but no one in the audience could figure out why you guys teamed up, or against what."
[08:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Zantetsuken: No armor... lean build... doesn't carry himself like a warrior or like a sorcerer. Any stroke through the center should do, delivered quickly.
[08:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "I see. Describe them further." 12Jol and Marek share another look - a long-suffering one, you'd judge - and then Jol describes several people. Later, you can't remember what he said about them.
[08:31] <03Crion> 4Can Ir describe the guy she fought? Or is the Emissary not asking her?
[08:31] <03@Ferrinus> 12For some reason, the Emissary doesn't seem to have this problem. "Noted. Do you know where in the city they might be found?" 12This you can recall - Jol mentions a few office buildings in the Nexus district, an apartment in Sentinel Hill.
[08:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12The Emissary hasn't asked Ir to explain, presumably unfamiliar or uninterested as to the actual gladiatorial bout.
[08:32] <03Crion> 4She won't offer anything further unless asked, then.
[08:33] <03Crion> 4She's not too eager to spend a lot of time talking to this guy.
[08:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "And the explosion... theirs?" 12Jol nods. "Naturally."
[08:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12The robed figure looks around again in silence. Outside, you can hear the crackle of flames, the murmur of the crowd, the voice of the announcer trying to explain that everything is in order and events will be moving on shortly.
[08:35] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "There might still be a body under the arena, in the animal pens. One of them was trying to disrupt the fight with sorcery. We stopped him."
[08:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom is mentally calculating how quickly she can shove Eikichi out the window before jumping out of it herself, on the principle that if you've avoided boiling from the inside by falling off a tall tower, then you've solved one pressing problem and now have time to work on the next.
[08:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Another moment passes. Finally, the Emissary speaks again: "Well, this seems to me a matter of internal arena security."
[08:40] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Aw, you're leaving?"
[08:42] <03Crion> 4Oh thank the Sun.
[08:44] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emisarry: "This incident has passed and I see no need to further intervene. The Guild, however, will likely demand a full accounting of damage to their property. I advise you to seek appropriate arbitration."
[08:45] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary*
[08:45] <03Crion> 4Well, fuck to the Guild, but that's better than having to deal with this guy or the Council.
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's it? You're not going to boil anybody?"
[08:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Is this some kind of test?"
[08:46] <03Crion> 4EIKICHI--
[08:47] <03Crion> 4Ir's eyebrow doesn't actually twitch.
[08:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "Should I? You may present your argument. I may have overlooked something."
[08:47] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol is searching Eikichi's face, desperate to find a joke.
[08:47] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Eikichi, don't be rude! It was good seeing you again!" 13She waves to the Emissary. "Thanks for the ride over!"
[08:49] <03Crion> 4Without glaring at Eikichi: "We'd prefer just to make this right with the affected parties and seek medical attention."
[08:49] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, I won't gainsay you. It's just weird, is all."
[08:49] <03Crion> 4This time Ir looks imploringly at Blossom.
[08:50] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Not really. Surely many, even most, of the interactions the Emissary has on a day-to-day basis don't end with blood boiling."
[08:51] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "It seems to me that you pay too much credence to rumor. My direct intervention, punity or otherwise, are rarely required for the city's continued functioning. That's the point, after all."
[08:51] <03dammitwho> "People think the Thousand Scales spend all day doing audits."
[08:51] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I met him when I was out shopping the other day! He was nice."
[08:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Damn, what happened there.
[08:52] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "It seems to me that you pay too much credence to rumor. My direct intervention, punitive or otherwise, is rarely required for the city's continued functioning. That's the point, after all."
[08:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi shrugs. "Maybe!"
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Emissary: "You should heed your associates in this matter. Now, farewell." 12He sweeps away, receiving no stains and leaving no footprints as he crosses the floor and descends what remains of the tower's spiral stairway.
[08:53] <03Crion> 4That's...not a direct challenge. That's good.
[08:53] <03Crion> 4Phew.
[08:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Byeeee~!"
[08:53] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek tilts his head to the side for a moment, presumably listening for the footsteps to leave the range of audibility. Then he says: "What the fuck-"
[08:54] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Is this man a fool? Does he want us all dead?"
[08:54] <03Crion> 4Ir wheels on Eikichi: "Fucking SUN--"
[08:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "No, it's fine. See, I don't think he could've."
[08:55] <03dammitwho> "Calm down. Obviously the Emissary isn't going to start burning people alive for asking a question."
[08:55] <03Crion> 4Ir: "That's not obvious to me!"
[08:55] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I wonder if the Emissary even has powers if nobody's breaking the rules."
[08:56] <03Crion> 4Ir: "That's a real good thought experiment that I'd love to hear you work out anytime except when the Emissary is present."
[08:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "His kind do as they please. The rules... polite fictions. Hardly polite, in this city."
[08:56] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "How sure are you?"
[08:57] <03Crion> 4Ugh. There are more important things to tend to than this. "Jol, what can we do to help? Can you walk?"
[08:57] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Not very. It's hard to get a read on what someone can do if they're not doing it in front of you."
[08:57] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "No, no, I see his point. The Civilities are polite fictions. The Dogmas, though..."
[08:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10To Ying: "What was it like when he pulled you up the tower? Was it like Travel Without Distance? Did you fly?"
[08:58] <03Crion> 4She glances around. "Also do we think the rest of these assholes are still hanging around somewhere?"
[08:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol's scarabs have finished collecting, but his limbs are still made of scarabs at the moment. "How many dead bodies do you have on hand?"
[08:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I don't have any dead bodies on hand."
[08:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do they have to be human?"
[08:59] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I could kill a blood ape for you."
[08:59] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom squints curiously at the injured Lunar. "Or a cartload of beef?"
[08:59] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Um, we were standing there and then everything stretched out and when it snapped back together we were coming upstairs instead."
[09:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol scoffs. "I'd rather wait. A few minutes more at most."
[09:00] <03trenchfoot> "It was kind of uncomfortable, but only when you think about it."
[09:01] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Suit yourself. Did everything turn out alright in Sijan?"
[09:01] <03Crion> 4Ir will check the stairwells at least. "How many colors are there, Eikichi?"
[09:02] <03Crion> "Of the Chosen of Heaven or whatever."
[09:02] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "It is probably too early to tell. I accomplished my objective, however."
[09:03] <03@VoxPVoxD> "It'd have to be five, for the five Maidens. Blue for Venus, green for Jupiter, red for Mars, yellow for Mercury, purple for Saturn."
[09:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I think we've seen chosen of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn."
[09:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "That's right. You've dealt with them before?"
[09:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Twice."
[09:04] <03Crion> 4Ir: "One of them."
[09:04] <03Crion> "Two times."
[09:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Get 'em?"
[09:04] <03Crion> "Mine was Mars, and yours downstairs was Jupiter. So if they've got the whole set, there's blue, yellow and purple in the wind."
[09:05] <03Crion> 4Ir snorts. "We made friends."
[09:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We befriended one and the other may or may not have been annihilated."
[09:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "What."
[09:05] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "What!"
[09:05] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What what?"
[09:05] <03@VoxPVoxD> "She was really stupid."
[09:06] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Tatsuya's still really mad at her, I'm pretty sure."
[09:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> "The one we befriended, I mean. Basically following nonsense orders she couldn't explain that were way out of her pay grade."
[09:06] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "She's naive."
[09:06] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "You say popoto."
[09:07] <03dammitwho> "So do you! But they don't in the North, for some reason."
[09:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Naive. One of the star-blessed... you should've...!" 12Marek, to Ir: "You knew about this?"
[09:07] <03Crion> 4Ir turns to glare at Marek now. "She wanted to talk, and talking was far, far less aggravating than trying to kill her."
[09:07] <03Crion> "Because we tried."
[09:07] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "That's why he's still mad."
[09:07] <03Crion> "I don't like her and I don't trust her, but at least I don't have to try to fucking stab her anymore."
[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We should've, then we didn't, and now we shouldn't have. So it goes."
[09:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Not hard enough, clearly. The- no, no, that's not fair. I must admit to you that I've never downed one of them personally."
[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Is there somewhere better we could have this conversation?"
[09:08] <03@VoxPVoxD> "At some point the Guild's going to be up here."
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "I have. This one, what is her - oh, yes, perhaps."
[09:09] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Back to our inn."
[09:09] <03@Ferrinus> 12That's not your only issue. It sounds like there's a building Ir! Ir! Ir! Ir! chant from the crowd outside.
[09:09] <03Crion> 4She sighs. "I have to deal with this."
[09:09] <03Crion> "Y'all slip out while I do."
[09:09] <03Crion> "You're coming too, 'Arakesh.'"
[09:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> "You two have fun."
[09:10] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Thanks. If I see the Emissary, I'll talk shit for you."
[09:10] <03Crion> 4That might have come out meaner than she intended, but SERIOUSLY?
[09:10] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10It was fine.
[09:10] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek looks over to his compatriot, who's rising to his feet on shaky but seemingly-functional legs. The full moon on Jol's brow is fading. Marek: "All right. Your 'Palace', then - tomorrow?"
[09:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "We'll be there."
[09:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12You prepare to break, then, as the event proceeds towards its conclusion. Ir's to return to the field to address the cheering crowds and accept their accolades; later, she'll be formally awarded, anointed as a true veteran of the grand arena and inducted into the halls of veteran gladiators. Separately, the Guild wants to know what the fuck happened here and underground, pressing 
[09:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12Blossom for the answers.
[09:13] <03Crion> 4A third to half of the room is still taken up by Ir's bonfire anima. When she steps out onto the roof, it's stretching up to the sky once again.
[09:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Everyone is leaving Eikichi alone, then?
[09:14] <03Crion> 4Veteran? That's getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Ir will still take another victory lap atop the tyrant lizard she's befriended while 'Arakesh' tends to his 'twin.'
[09:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Not if he remains hanging around on the scene of the crime, or possible crime, or whatever the hell happened. And people do remember him running off out of the stands around the same time the trouble started, so he'll be questioned shortly if not immediately.
[09:15] <03Crion> 4She will even indulge the promoters in all the post-fight bullshit they're certain to want. It's good cover, and staying firmly in public with Marek by her side or close to it is the safest thing she can do right now.
[09:15] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying will stay with Eikichi. She's not involved, but she can't exactly just go walking home with all her friends tied up in this mess!
[09:16] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, of course, could ask the Guild the same question. There was an attempted assassination attempt on a fighter she's managing, after all. What is the Guild doing to investigate it?
[09:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Well, Eikichi will walk back to the box, anyway. There's bound to be some snacks left. To Ying: "So..."
[09:17] <03@Ferrinus> 12Oh, "Arakesh" wants no part of the limelight. In fact, the less well it's understood that the Twin Dragons are actually acting at the beck and call of some mysterious southern shaman or whatever he is, the better for Ir's publicity. The Lunar melts back into the hidden machinery of arena.
[09:18] <03trenchfoot> 13She's not quite skipping, but Ying's walking jauntily alongside Eikichi. "Hm?"
[09:19] <03@Ferrinus> 12W-what? Comes the reply to Blossom. Of course! Of COURSE they're getting to the bottom of it. No expenses spared. Top men. Top men! But seriously she doesn't know ANYTHING?
[09:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, I don't want to pry... but how are the forfeits coming along?"
[09:26] <03trenchfoot> 13She narrowly avoids stumbling. "They're... I've got something sketched out for Tatsuya's! I think he'll love it," 13which is maybe the worst thing she's ever said about her own work.
[09:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12By the end of the ceremonies, Ir has been all but drowned under ribbons, flowers, laurel wreaths, and suchlike. She's got a gleaming trophy with carved likenesses of her and her foes atop it - blue and red jade for each of the 'dragons', white jade for her own triumphant figure. A feast is thrown that runs late into the evening, at which Ir and her invitees end up rubbing shoulders 
[09:27] <03@Ferrinus> 12with Guild magnates, popular artisans and performers, and, of course, famed gladiators who've weathered other bouts in the arena.
[09:27] <03Crion> 4Ir lets Marek slip away, while hoping he remains close by. These are his tyrany lizards, after all.
[09:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12If she wants to bring him along to the actual feasting, she might be able to manage it. She'll have to find him somewhere in the bowels of the colosseum and convince him to come along, of course.
[09:28] <03Crion> 4Throughout the ceremonies Ir is polite but distant, allowing herself to be fêted but remaining the unapproachable champion.
[09:28] <03Crion> 4Unless they ask her for a song, of course.
[09:32] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom curtly tells them that she has no idea who would have ordered such a thing, which is mostly true. Plenty of people who could, but the Guild knows that as well as she does, considering they're most of them.
[09:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you think it's worse, ethically, to design an atrocious outfit for someone as punishment, or for someone who won't know any better and think it looks good?"
[09:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Meditate on this while you do both."
[09:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Ughhhhhhh."
[09:37] <03Crion> 4Ir's angle here is savage diva. Unapproachable, powerful, and utterly unconcerned with decorum or local nicety. One or two of her favorite singles acts did this back in Pneuma, and she's certainly laid the foundation to build an image on. And crucially, she doesn't have to strip down to a chainmail bikini or some dumb shit.
[09:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12C'mon, just once-
[09:38] <03Crion> 4That guy gets the down-the-nose death glare.
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Most of you can't help but notice that the conduct of the other gladiators towards Ir is a little strange. What seem at first glance to be a mixture of distrustful or even envious glances might, in fact, be better described as awed or even worshipful. There's a motley of other fighters around and, at turns, they're all giving each other significant looks or muttered comments or 
[09:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12whatever and it's certainly about the night's champion, and it certainly entails more than professional curiosity or fear of losing one's place.
[09:41] <03Crion> 4That's not how pro fighters should be acting.
[09:42] <03Crion> 4At least, not in all the stories Ir's heard third-hand about them.
[09:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Separately, the high-ranking Guildsmen in attendance are VERY pleased, and it's probably not just a matter of the day's turnout (especially since arena repairs are going to run much higher than anyone anticipated and Blossom was canny enough to negotiate for a percentage of the gross)
[09:48] <03Crion> 4It's good Ir's decided to be severe and distant this night. Once she figures out why all these cats look like they've eaten canaries, the scowl is perfectly genuine.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4She might not be as smart as Eikichi, Blossom, or Ying, but she's got the advantage of social position right now and she's going to take it. Ir stares each one of her rich hotshot genuflectors down -- not to intimidate them, but to commit their faces to memory along with their names.
[09:50] <03Crion> 4She probably intimidates them anyway, and that's fine.
[09:57] <03Crion> 4The food and drink are fantastic, and she's tired enough that they don't even taste like ash in her mouth. She entertains her entire public to the best of her ability -- aloof, but not too aloof. Beautiful, but with an edge to her. She spent a lot of time in Pneuma learning stage presence. That doesn't go away just because she's not singing.
[09:57] <03Crion> 4But twenty-five minutes after the bare minimum of politeness, she announces that she will take her rest.
[09:58] <03@Ferrinus> 12If this means she actually wants a private audience with whomsoever that's up to her, but it's perfectly possible to just warp to the following day if need be.
[09:59] <03Crion> 4She very specifically does not want to spend another minute in the same room as these people until she's had a chance to speak with the rest of the Circle.
[09:59] <03Crion> 4She'll direct all requests for a private audience to her manager.
[10:00] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom has a special box where she keeps all the marriage proposals sent to Ir.
[10:04] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi amuses himself by visibly directing bowls of soup to dunk themselves on the heads of particularly insufferable-looking Guildsmen with particularly jaded and checked-out-looking children.
[10:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12He's got a few more die-hard fans than Ir by the end of the night.
[10:07] <03Crion> 4Thank the Sun.
[10:07] <03@Ferrinus> 12Other goals on anyone's part, or do we adjourn to the Scarlet Palace on the following afternoon?
[10:07] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's ready to sleep all this wine off.
[10:08] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying will be mentioning her new shop - perhaps you've heard of it - at any chance she gets, but otherwise will be ready for the next day.
[10:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Ying gets some definite interest. Isn't she the one that was sitting with the Emissary for a moment? Isn't she the one whose name is associated with those simply scandalous boot.. things...? Let me get my servant to write this down in my planner-
[10:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12All in all, it's a pretty successful outing you've had, I say.
[10:13] <03dammitwho> 7Either that evening or the next afternoon, to Ying: "Seriously though, the Emissary? How did you snag him? I'm not complaining, mind you, great job, we all support you, it's just... wow!"
[10:13] <03Crion> 4When Ir leaves, she'll head straight back to the inn -- leaping across the rooftops if that's what it takes to shake her public -- and will be waiting for her three friends in their private common room when they return.
[10:13] <03@Ferrinus> 12The following afternoon, on Moonday, the Squared Circle's sleeping off various injuries and hangovers and expecting a visit from as many as two of Luna's chosen. Have they got anything they want to say or do before then?
[10:13] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What are you talking about?" 13She seems genuinely confused.
[10:14] <03Crion> 4If Ir didn't get a chance to corral the three of them the night of the event, she'll do it on Moonday afternoon.
[10:14] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi will be there in a blanket he bought on the way home. It's got sleeves in it so you can stay warm while eating candy.
[10:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12That's the kind of disruptive innovation you can't get anywhere but the free city of Nexus.
[10:15] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Come on! You guys were holding hands!"
[10:15] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "Yeah! He warped me over to you guys! Isn't he just so nice?"
[10:15] <03dammitwho> "Eikichi, don't eat candy for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."
[10:16] <03@Ferrinus> 12That's the kind of psychotic tyranny that justified the Usurpation.
[10:17] <03Crion> 4In fact, she'll be waiting for them with sandwiches.
[10:17] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi nods, mouth full. "I know! That's what we agreed. One non-candy meal a day. I had cinnamon rolls for breakfast."
[10:19] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "That is absolutely not what we agreed. Set an example!"
[10:20] <03Crion> 4Ir's tailored the offerings to what she's noticed the three of them like to eat. Four sandwiches each, made to keep so they can have two of them later. She hasn't made anything for herself.
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi will take one of the tuna melts Ir made for him. Eating healthy is important!
[10:21] <03Crion> 4Once everyone's at least had half of their first sandwich: "Slavery is coming back to Nexus."
[10:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi chokes.
[10:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> "What?"
[10:22] <03Crion> 4Ir reaches over and slaps him hard on the back.
[10:22] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom, quietly eating: "Oh?" 7She hasn't yet realized this isn't, like, a comment on the weather.
[10:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You noticed how happy the Guildsmen were at the feast?"
[10:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12That's impossible because Nexus is a free city in which you can't be enslaved.
[10:22] <03Crion> "That wasn't because of me."
[10:23] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "What happened?"
[10:23] <03Crion> "I'm just the prop of the hour. The new toy to show off. They don't even respect me enough to hold their tongues when I'm in earshot."
[10:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Gladitorial slaves?"
[10:26] <03Crion> 4She shifts on the divan she's sitting on. "Bigger than that. It's Guild business, and the Guild doesn't constrain itself to the Arena. It has -- how did he put it -- 'more comprehensive' plans."
[10:27] <03Crion> 4Ir leans forward. "They had a problem, you see. I don't know what it was or how it was solved, but by the team we were feasting, that problem had been dealt with."
[10:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Do you think it's got something to do with Panther?"
[10:28] <03trenchfoot> 13Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "So... we should create some new ones, right?"
[10:28] <03Crion> "The point man here, his name is Z'raha. Leering smile. Looks like a shithead. His job title is 'Regional Coordinator.' I don't know of what. Probably slaves."
[10:29] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "If they're still planning on selling to the Mask of Winters..."
[10:29] <03Crion> 4Ir half-shrugs, half-throws her arms in the air. "I don't know. I couldn't tell from what I overheard. Maybe it had something to do with Panther. Maybe it had something to do with me! Maybe those Chosen of Heaven that we killed were somehow--"
[10:30] <03Crion> 4She pauses. "It's not helpful to think about it that way."
[10:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "A mi'qote slaver... that's awful."
[10:31] <03Crion> "Z'raha. Regional Coordinator. Point man on this. He's got bosses, a Board of Magnates, only one of whom was present at the Arena feast. The name of the magnate that was present is Cheng."
[10:32] <03Crion> "Z'raha was relieved, because the Board of Magnates -- and Cheng -- were breathing down his neck about their problem. The slavery problem. The one they've just solved."
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Well, that can't happen.
[10:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "
[10:33] <03Crion> "And Z'raha bragged that his problem was solved through efforts of a trusted underling. Name of Shizon."
[10:33] <03@Ferrinus> 12At some turn or other all of you have heard the rumors - some kind of perennial, unsolvable stoppage with the Guild's slave trade in the city. No one really knows why. Guess that's done with?
[10:33] <03Crion> "I don't have a physical description or even a gender on Shizon."
[10:33] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying:"Sounds like I should step out for a bit, then."
[10:34] <03Crion> 4Ir's hands are clenched into fists in her lap. "But they sat right in front of me and talked about how good it was they could buy and sell people again, given the proper permits."
[10:35] <03Crion> 4She was going to say something like 'we can't let this go,' but listening to her friends and looking around the room, she finds she doesn't have to.
[10:36] <03Crion> 4So instead she takes half of the one sandwich she prepared for herself -- greens and seared frostboar on flatbread -- and scarfs it down.
[10:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom's vaguely uncomfortable, since this is clearly a huge deal to Ir and a big deal to Eikichi, but fortunately she doesn't have to feel or voice disagreement. Selling to Deathlords and raksha is treason against Creation. Hell, even mundane maltreatment of slaves is wrong, and the Guild certainly doesn't have a good reputation on that score.
[10:43] <03Crion> 4When she's finished, she's looking to her friends for help.
[10:44] <03Crion> 4She can't do anything herself except autograph signings, right now.
[10:46] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying looks determined, if also a little unhappy that she can't do this all herself.
[10:46] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's face looks the same as it always does.
[10:47] <03Crion> 4Ir: "If I had to peg it, Blossom, you can figure out what the actual hierarchy is here -- who talks to who, who orders who around, who's got, I dunno, blackmail on whom -- using your position as my manager as cover."
[10:47] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Um. Not that I don't trust you to source your own ingredients, but do you happen to know where the tuna in these came from?"
[10:47] <03dammitwho> "Oh, that. Yes, I can do that."
[10:47] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I took the Heavensward out this morning and caught it myself."
[10:47] <03Crion> "...I didn't sleep much last night."
[10:48] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Eikichi, you can probably find where they're physically keeping these people, and some promising ins."
[10:48] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I bet Marek and Jol will help us."
[10:49] <03Crion> 4Ir, to Ying: "And Ying...if both of you are good with it, we might need Tatsuya on this one."
[10:49] <03Crion> "Unless you're actually dating the Emissary."
[10:49] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I'm not! Why do people keep saying that?"
[10:49] <03Crion> 4Holding hands!
[10:50] <03Crion> 4To Eikichi: "Yeah. I hope they can."
[10:50] <03trenchfoot> 13Is a perfectly normal activity that people who are teleporting need to do sometimes!
[10:51] <03Crion> "But this isn't something I want to pass off to others. If they want to help us, they're more than welcome -- but we're the ones who are fixing this."
[10:51] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "This probably means conflict with the Emissary at some point."
[10:52] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Not if we're smart, careful, and lucky."
[10:52] <03dammitwho> "We're just saying, it would be very sweet if you were. Ir, I would strongly recommend that none of this plan involve anyone outside this room. Including our Lunar friends."
[10:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "If Ying wants to pretend she doesn't have a crush on the Emissary, I support her."
[10:53] <03trenchfoot> 13Ying: "I don't! He's just nice, is all!"
[10:53] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Some of my favorite people have gone ages pretending they didn't have crushes."
[10:53] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I'm fine with that. I like Marek, obviously, but he has his own concerns and his own agenda."
[10:53] <03trenchfoot> "Tatsuya will help out and if he doesn't you have my permission to beat him up."
[10:53] <03Crion> 4Ir cracks a smile. "Thank you. Though that might be counter-productive."
[10:57] <03Crion> 4Ir: "One last thing. This whole...scheme...has a name. At least I think it does."
[10:58] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The word 'Channel' came up five or six times. Said like there was a capital letter at the front, but not a person or a place."
[11:02] <03Crion> "And whatever it is, we're not looking to stop Channel. Not directly, anyway. Channel's already worked."
[11:02] <03Crion> "What comes next..." 4Ir waves a frustrated hand. "Well, I'm sure it'll be perfectly legal."
[11:06] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's later in the afternoon that a pair of visitors show up at the Crimson Palace's door. One is Azer'Jol, a sallow man in a dark robe who's always looking around out of sunken eyes. The other, no one recognizes - a fit, compactly-built man with close-cropped brown hair and a fair helping of small scars in random places - across his nose, down one sheek, up the side of a hand.
[11:06] <03Crion> 4...
[11:07] <03Crion> 4Where's Marek?
[11:07] <03Crion> 4She gets it when he grins at her.
[11:08] <03Crion> 4She blushes, crosses her arms, shakes her head, and waves for them to follow her upstairs.
[11:08] <03@Ferrinus> 12Where, indeed. "Greetings, chosen," 12says Jol, in a somewhat halting voice. He seems fully healed. His fellow nods to the rest of you: "Good to see you."
[11:09] <03Crion> 4Pleasantly: "Greetings, Jol." 4Petulantly: "Hi, Marek."
[11:10] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hello."
[11:10] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya: "Yo."
[11:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Are you hungry?"
[11:11] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I've got a bunch of candy I'm not allowed to eat."
[11:11] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Aheh. Hello. So." 12Where has Ir seen this person before...? "I alr-" 12Jol: "Yes."
[11:11] <03Crion> 4Ir: "There are some sandwiches. If you want sandwiches."
[11:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "What power is this that keeps a chosen of the sun from his feast?"
[11:12] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi sighs. "Love."
[11:12] <03Crion> 4She stares at Marek. There's something about him. Not HIM, but the face he's wearing.
[11:13] <03Crion> 4Even when he notices, she doesn't stop staring intently at him with narrowed eyes.
[11:14] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Ah! Love. My condolences." 12It's hard to tell if he's joking. Marek, meanwhile, looks back gamely, seemingly unperturbed. He says: "So - as I said. You've proven yourself. To my circle, certainly. Someone else bothers you about the spear, refer them to me."
[11:14] <03Crion> 4That just makes her narrow her eyes and purse her lips more. And cross her arms harder.
[11:15] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "But I'm concerned th- what?"
[11:15] <03Crion> 4Leaning forward: "I know you from somewhere."
[11:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Ir and Ying last saw this figure yesterday, a little past noon... dodging, with increasing desperation and decreasing success, Iscariot's business end.
[11:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12And Eikichi last saw him ages ago, from midair, in the Hedgehog...
[11:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Ahaha."
[11:18] <03@Ferrinus> 12He watches for the moment of realization.
[11:19] <03trenchfoot> 6Tatsuya just leans back, pretending not to realize. "What's funny?"
[11:19] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That counts?"
[11:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Oh, usually not! But I have my tricks."
[11:20] <03Crion> 4Ir almost leaps out of her seat, point an accusing finger at him. "YOU, are an ASSHOLE, and FUCK that guy!"
[11:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Gods, she's like a teenager.
[11:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10How the mighty have gotten even cooler.
[11:22] <03Crion> 4Oh, you'd fuck him too, don't even play.
[11:22] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10I couldn't possibly comment.
[11:22] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Ahahaha! But keep it quiet. This - this face? A precious treasure. The ultimate prize. Part of, at least."
[11:23] <03Crion> 4Ir grumps back down into her seat. "Be more accurate to ~shapeshift~ into a big ol' pile of lizard shit."
[11:23] <03dammitwho> "What?"
[11:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Heh, agreed. But that's beyond my power - and far, far less useful."
[11:25] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Wait, he somehow ate--"
[11:25] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "He trained those tyrant lizards, remember. A physical, spiritual connection between an animal and its tamer... it makes sense to me."
[11:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "To arrange this... it took some doing. I was a fly on many walls. I believe, that they believed, that we didn't know, and that they would enjoy more backup, and some other things besides. And now they surely know that certain servants, certain safehouses, are useless."
[11:26] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Marek is wearing the face of the Chosen of Heaven that Borneo ate yesterday."
[11:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "All we need.. well, I'll put that aside for now. What are you doing in this city? And what of this chosen of the stars that you... took pity on?"
[11:29] <03Crion> 4Ir leans back with an obviously affected air of nonchalance. "Oh, we're doing things."
[11:32] <03dammitwho> "Nexus is cosmopolitan and decadent, and we were newly wealthy and in need of many things available for sale here."
[11:32] <03dammitwho> "Nexus is a good place to go, and having gone, to leave."
[11:32] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We're mostly goofing off and getting more famous. Have you read my book?"
[11:32] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "We are not goofing off."
[11:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I'm goofing off."
[11:33] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Eikichi is goofing off."
[11:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Thank you."
[11:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Hrmm. I see the appeal. Unfortunately, there is little time for such, for us."
[11:34] <03Crion> "The rest of us aren't. Like I said. Doing things."
[11:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi gives Marek a look as if to ask, is he like this all the time?
[11:34] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek looks back like, yes.
[11:35] <03Crion> 4He spends a lot of time with dead people.
[11:35] <03dammitwho> 7Eating dead people.
[11:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Why the... fighting? The arena?"
[11:35] <03dammitwho> 7I mean, that's weird, no? That's a weird thing to do even if it gives you super powers.
[11:36] <03@Ferrinus> 12I guess it's okay when you're made of crypt scarabs?
[11:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi wouldn't do it, personally, but he tries to be broad-minded.
[11:36] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Ir's a natural performer. In Crystal she was a famous bard."
[11:36] <03Crion> 4Ir: "When you act, your enemies react. In this city, fighting in the arena is the ultimate act."
[11:37] <03Crion> 4She breaks into a lop-sided grin. "Could be one here, too, if I wasn't so busy being a famous gladiator."
[11:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "That's certainly true. But you didn't know we were to use your fight to bait a trap for heaven. ...right?"
[11:38] <03Crion> 4Ir: "No. No we didn't."
[11:39] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Someone could have told us."
[11:39] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Honestly we don't usually think that far ahead."
[11:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Aheh. Sorry. But the fewer who know, yes? And Jol didn't want to." 12Jol: "I did not want you to show them this face, either." 12Marek gives Eikichi another long-suffering look.
[11:41] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Oh, please. Who the hell would we talk to? We're the only people who can stand us."
[11:41] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Hmm. I was hoping we'd become so dangerous to Heaven after the Hedgehog incident that they'd sent assassins after us on that strength alone. Pity."
[11:41] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "They should understand what an enormous win this was - and how grateful we are. And they're not stupid enough to let this slip."
[11:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "They were stupid enough to call a-" 12What's the term he used? Later, you can't recall. "-a friend."
[11:42] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Jol! Come on."
[11:42] <03Crion> 4Ir: "I could do without the assassins from Heaven, personally."
[11:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I could do without Heaven."
[11:43] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Fair."
[11:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "I wish for an accounting of this... ally of yours."
[11:43] <03Crion> 4Ir blinks. "I'm sorry?"
[11:43] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "How do you mean?"
[11:43] <03@Ferrinus> 12It's Blossom Jol is looking at. "Are you heaven's foe or not?"
[11:46] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Not the damn point."
[11:47] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi's not gonna say anything before Blossom does.
[11:51] <03dammitwho> "I haven't committed to butchering everyone in Yu-Shan on principle, if that's what you're asking." 7She leans forward. "The Realm is ruled by cruel usurpers who live off theft and murder, and abandon their spiritual and moral duties to their lessers. The Realm, as it is, must fall. But the Realm is also my home, and if the Unconquered Sun teaches anything he teaches that without 
[11:51] <03dammitwho> mercy, justice becomes tyranny."
[11:52] <03dammitwho> "Since the King of Heaven turned his face from Creation, Heaven too has been ruled by usurpers and thieves, petty gods who crave more than their station permits and corrupt bureaucrats who abuse their power."
[11:53] <03dammitwho> "But Sol Invictus is still the King of Heaven."
[11:53] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Amen."
[11:56] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "The Maidens, too, are of high place. If one of their Chosen can learn to take up virtue's banner, I'll welcome her, because she who stands with me shall be my sister. And I will treat her the way I treat any ally: friendship for friendship, vengeance for betrayal."
[11:57] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek leans back. Azer'jol, though, leans forward. "Have we not been betrayed? Must not heaven fall? Must not every hand with which it reaches into our affairs be severed at the wrist?"
[11:58] <03dammitwho> "I've told you all this because we don't know each other very well yet and it's important to understand the other person's values when going into a dangerous undertaking. But- will you be bringing your every acquaintance before us and offering an accounting?"
[11:58] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "It's not betrayal unless they were originally on our side, is it?"
[12:00] <03Crion> 4Ir: "You're looking healthy. You're looking great. You're looking monk chic. Don't see any holes in your robe, you know? Why's that? Why are you still walking around?" 4She leans forward. "You're still walking around because you had us eat those sins, those swords, and those curving lances of fire for you. You sprung a trap and the mechanism of it was not you. You had us put in 
[12:00] <03Crion> the work. Know what? We were happy to do that."
[12:00] <03Crion> "But you know what that means."
[12:00] <03Crion> "It means the questions go the other way."
[12:00] <03@Ferrinus> 12You don't recall their response here. A little later, Marek says: "...a fair question. And no, no, we won't. But we should hear it once, shouldn't we? To spread the word."
[12:00] <03Crion> "We don't answer to you, Azer'jol."
[12:01] <03@Ferrinus> 12You don't recall their response to Eikichi, I mean. You certainly recall Jol saying: "How many did you fight. One? With help. Three fell upon me!"
[12:01] <03Crion> 4Ir: "It was your plan, dumbass."
[12:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Our plan to ambush them, to cut them off, to confuse their allies! Would you still stand without us? If they'd been free to plot your fall without us hiding, listening?"
[12:03] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Probably. I did egg them on-"
[12:04] <03Crion> 4Ir: "It doesn't matter."
[12:04] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "No, wait. Hold on."
[12:04] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "That is not my point-"
[12:04] <03dammitwho> "Did you answer Eikichi's question?"
[12:07] <03Crion> "I'm still standing because I kicked one tyrant lizard's ass and then the other respected me enough to go hard against our mutual dipshit tryhard fuckface. Without Borneo and Kamchatka, I'm at full speed. I'm at the height of my powers. Ask Marek what two-thirds of the way towards the height of my powers looks like, because that's what he threw down with. With Borneo and Kamchatka, I 
[12:07] <03Crion> knocked one out and then had a goddamn teamup with the other. I'm not here for what might have happened, Jol. I'm here for what I did."
[12:07] <03Crion> "And if it had happened another way, you know what? We'd have just won another way."
[12:12] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "Hm. This explains why we are having this talk in a midden heap of a city and not the halls of the deliberative."
[12:18] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "Nexus IS a midden heap of a city, because all it has to offer is rule by the strongest. We can be, and must be, better than that."
[12:20] <03dammitwho> "And-- no, hang on. Seriously. Did you answer Eikichi's question?"
[12:20] <03dammitwho> 7She looks at the other Solars. "Did he?"
[12:20] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "...I will consider your words. But you must hold this chosen of yours at arm's length."
[12:20] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah, he- wait."
[12:21] <03@VoxPVoxD> "No?"
[12:21] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Of course he didn't."
[12:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek looks back and forth. "He did, I'm afraid. It's... ah, it's hard to explain."
[12:21] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Your... friend. Have you told anyone else about her?"
[12:22] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Yes, every innkeep, raksha, Wyld Huntsman and captain of the what do you think?"
[12:23] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek chuckles. "Then you're too honorable to have run into this yourself! Lovely."
[12:23] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom gets straight to the point. "Why don't we remember?"
[12:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Heaven's agents... they. I must talk around this. Telling you is useless. But you'll figure it out."
[12:24] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Is it magic that prevents us from understanding?"
[12:24] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "When a newly-Chosen Lunar is inducted into the Pact, they're told... you know. Of the evils of the Realm. Of the crime of 'civilization'. Of the web of deceit and so on and so on, and this is why we fight."
[12:25] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "But the stronger they grow and the more they experience - the more they experience, for themselves, the more they'll understand what really drives their elders."
[12:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "You are learned, are you not? You and Eikichi. But there are things you can't learn out of books. Things you can't simply be told by your betters. Yes?"
[12:26] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "We haven't got any betters."
[12:26] <03@Ferrinus> 12He and Jol both snort, but only he looks amused.
[12:27] <03Crion> 4Ir: "The reason why is they tend to die. The Sun chooses who He can, not who He wants."
[12:27] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "But is there magic blocking us from understanding or knowing something without direct apprehension?"
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12He answers you. What did he say? Logically, he must have said yes, right? That's the only way- "-es. Can't... implicate them. Tell of them. Spread the word."
[12:28] <03Crion> 4Even Ir's starting to pick up on it now.
[12:28] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "People can hear you, and believe you. They might be shocked or furious. But it fades."
[12:28] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's fine, then. Magic can be got around."
[12:28] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Might be better if we don't talk about them."
[12:29] <03Crion> "Clean them out."
[12:29] <03Crion> "Make them like they never were."
[12:29] <03Crion> "No one can remember them, right?"
[12:29] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "I mean, surely they can remember each other. Think of how stupid it would be otherwise."
[12:29] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "We don't know how they do it. Ah, if Kisha were here, she has her theories..."
[12:30] <03dammitwho> 7She frowns. "How? How could anyone-- ugh. Of course either you don't know or you couldn't tell me if you did."
[12:30] <03dammitwho> "That'll have to go."
[12:30] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "We actually don't know. Some great magic... but what great magic? If our elders have figured it out, they haven't been able to tell us."
[12:31] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom paces. "No. No. Intolerable."
[12:31] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Yeah, we have to fix this."
[12:31] <03Crion> 4Ir files the name 'Kisha' away.
[12:32] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol: "I believe Ir has the right of it. That they practice some deceit and must simply be made to stop."
[12:33] <03Crion> 4Ir shifts in her seat, and resists saying 'of COURSE I have the right of it--' "Of course. The life or death of any given Chosen -- not relevant. It's the fullness of their power. The structure."
[12:33] <03Crion> "Like Eikichi says. It's Heaven."
[12:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Does the magic extend to inanimate objects?"
[12:34] <03@VoxPVoxD> "Do you find yourselves losing things more often when the Chosen of the Maidens are around?"
[12:35] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Because they are stealing them invisibly? I'm not sure I follow."
[12:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "Because they pick them up or handle them, or leave them behind."
[12:36] <03dammitwho> 7She looks to Jol. "Don't mistake me for an appeaser or a reformist. To be set right, Heaven and Creation will have to be rebuilt from the bedrock up. This... privilege of invisibility cannot be allowed. Quite a few people will have to be put into the earth as a reminder to the next thousand generations. It's just, if I kill someone for doing the wrong thing, I want them to have had 
[12:36] <03dammitwho> a clear and open choice to do the right one."
[12:37] <03@Ferrinus> 12Jol is nodding slowly. Marek, meanwhile, shrugs at Eikichi. "I haven't noticed either way - though I'm hardly a scholar on the issue. All I know is, if you haven't seen for yourself, you won't remember another's account."
[12:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Eikichi: "That's so stupid."
[12:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I hate them so much."
[12:38] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Music to my ears. If only I heard it more often."
[12:40] <03Crion> 4Ir: "Mmm."
[12:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "Anyway! We understand each other, yes? We have a common enemy - one that, all too often, has the drop on us, operates under our noses, knows more than we do. But now... we have one of their faces."
[12:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "All we need... is the gate."
[12:40] <03dammitwho> 7Blossom: "The gate? What, to Heaven?"
[12:40] <03dammitwho> "I suppose there must be one."
[12:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12Marek: "The very same."
[12:40] <03@Ferrinus> 12How does one open the heavenly gate? Hopefully you'll find out... next week.

[22:40] <03Quaker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4d7Wp9kKjA
[22:45] <03Quaker> At Miramar, under the willows and on the edge of the water, three hundred pairs of eyes turn to see the new arrivals. The boat wobbles and lifts as its armored passengers step one by one off onto the landing’s flagstones, with the Princess’s retainers helping the three northern lords. The plan has been made. All that remains is for the barons to carry it out. As the novelty wears off, the party returns to itself, and the hum
[22:45] <03Quaker> of conversation and soft music returns. 
[22:48] <03Quaker> The three barons are standing in front of a wide grass lawn, littered with tables and serving platters overloaded with food. Bottles of champagne and other liquours are thick as the grass out here. There’s the heavy scent of blood in the air, coming from somewhere closer to the house. It’s hard to see through the crowd, but if you stand on your tip-toes, you can see the first floor lit through a series of huge double doors, 
[22:48] <03Quaker> with more people inside. 
[22:48] <03Crion> 4Cav's armor is as comfortable and unrestrictive as fashion will permit. If he can get away with just wearing a breastplate over his suit jacket, he will.
01[22:50] <03banana> 6Thanks to ancient sexist tradition, KJ's able to get away without armour at all. Nobody knows you're dangerous if you actually aren't!
01[22:50] <03banana> 6The question is how many people we're going to have to meet/greet first. In other circumstances this might be enjoyable.
[22:50] <03Crion> 4'Too many.'
[22:53] <03Quaker> KJ will have to blame the sexism of her own court, since there’s plenty of women wearing full plate getups. The Princess, for one. She inclines her head as you part. “Good luck. I will meet you back here at the launch in…” She starts an elegant-looking silver stopwatch on her wrist. “260 minutes.” It’s almost 11 o’clock at night. 
[22:54] <03Crion> 4Ominous.
01[22:55] <03banana> 6KJ: "I'm sure we'll be partied out by then. Enjoy."
01[22:55] <03banana> She hums a little to test the noise of the crowd, how audible everything is. Of course a lot of others here don't need ears to hear. 
[22:58] <03Crion> 4This many people in body armor tends to put Cav on edge. He wonders what kind of mock battle crap they've got planned for the evening.
01[22:58] <03banana> 6To whichever of her companions is visible: "Shall we plunder thes Latin hearts and meet up at the canapes?"
01[22:58] <03banana> *these
[22:58] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Sounds good to me."
[23:02] <03Crion> 4Well, what's the state of play? Surely there are some little cliques forming up, as they often do, and hey, maybe someone wants to talk to the new guy from L.A.
[23:06] <03Quaker> There are dozens of impenetrable little ones. As they scan the crowd, they can see people still glancing over out of curiosity, but no one makes a beeline for them. Out on the grass, you eventually see the familiar face of the Ambassador, Abby Gannon. She’s standing with a few other people, including one Cav’s seen before — a middle-aged man with shoulder-length black hair, dull yellow plate, and a blank, bored expression.
[23:06] <03Quaker> Where has he seen him before? It seems so near…
[23:07] <03Quaker> From the castle’s first floor, they can hear the sound of a scream, followed by a great gale of laughter. 
[23:07] <03Crion> 4Well.
[23:07] <03Crion> 4This is one of those parties.
[23:10] <03Crion> 4The LA Invictus are a strange lot, but one thing he's genuinely glad for is that publicly toying with and then murdering kine as a social centerpiece is somewhere between unpermitted and unthinkable.
[23:10] <03Crion> 4Not so in New York and, presumably now, San Diego.
[23:13] <03Quaker> Gannon sees KJ and the rest, and makes a quick expression that is impenetrable if you don’t know her well, and recognizable as “I’m so glad to see you, please rescue me from this conversation” if you do. 
01[23:18] <03banana> 6Not the kind of heart KJ was hoping to steal, but they'll need an ambassador on side if things go poorly tonight. She sashays over that way, trying not to knock any suits of armour over.
[23:18] <03Quaker> Oh. The last time Cav saw this person, they were reassembling themselves out of a murder of crows on top of a skyscraper, having just missed Cav, Santiago, Seabury, and the former Ambassador as they evacuated themselves in a helicopter. The Count San Ysidro, Ochoa had said. 
[23:19] <03Crion> 4Well.
[23:19] <03Crion> 4This is going to be a fun party.
[23:19] <03Crion> 4He hesitates briefly, then moseys on over.
[23:20] <03Quaker> Both Cav and KJ can see the robed and masked Nosferatu standing apart from the crowd, waiting. It must be K.J.’s naturally good eyesight, but she also realizes that there are heads mounted on the battlements of the castle, looking down at the party with empty gazes. 
01[23:23] <03banana> 6Christ. Maybe vampires should be illegal after all. Do they belong to anyone in particular? "Abigail, may I borrow you? There was just one point about the itinerary of signings. I'm sorry to cut in, everybody!"
[23:24] <03Crion> 4...Cav didn't realize KJ was about to do that.
[23:24] <03Crion> 4Now she's left him alone with the Count.
[23:24] <03Quaker> Nobody she recognizes, though they all seem to have crosses cut into their foreheads. “Baron Valentine! Of course, one moment, then you must meet everyone…” 
01[23:25] <03banana> 6KJ: "You know, I really should. Can we do introductions in a barbarously short interval?" 6She's basically imitating how La Jolla and her retinue talk at this point. Seems de rigeur, which is also something else they say.
[23:26] <03Quaker> Well, not just the count. An enormous man, seven feet tall and extraordinarily fat, peers down at Cav as clearly less important personages take shelter in his bulk. “So THIS is the little delegation Bailey sent down…and who are YOU, senor?” The Count says nothing. 
[23:27] <03Quaker> Gannon stops K.J. once they’re out of earshot. “You couldn’t find time to drop into my office before tonight?” 
01[23:27] <03banana> "I don't have a good answer for you, Abby, but I have an answer."
01[23:28] <03banana> "Did you know that the Princess La Jolla has a private rollercoaster?"
[23:28] <03Quaker> Abby frowns. “So you did go with her to her little park. Why? Did she ask you to do something?” 
01[23:30] <03banana> "No, that's the answer: the private wonderland. I said it's a bad excuse, but we've basically been alternating between the rides and clubbing."
01[23:30] <03banana> 6KJ: "Tell you what, let's catch up now?"
[23:32] <03Quaker> Abby clearly wants to let it go, but… “Just clubbing?” 
01[23:34] <03banana> 6KJ looks uncomfortable. "Maybe I should've brought a cooler down, but.. do you know about the thing I've got? I spend a bit more time feeding than most of us."
[23:36] <03Crion> 4He turns on the charm. "I, my lord, am Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna, Shepherd, and late of New York City." 4He hits the proper mix of respectful, breezy, and arrogant that plays well with this crowd. At least, he hopes it does.
[23:39] <03Quaker> The corners of the huge man’s eyes and mouth curl upwards in delight. “Oh, I’ve been mistaken. Not one of Bailey’s fey little creations, then! No, a real New Yorker. Charmed, Baron. I am…eh….” He flaps a meaty paw at his retinue. 
[23:41] <03Crion> 4Cav's pretty sure that's not mockery in his voice, and given what 'New York City values' mean in the context of the Kindred community, that's something Cav finds very concerning. What sort of retinue does this man have?
02[23:41] * Quits: Zarick (Zarick@sorcery-i6g8dl.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:42] <03Quaker> Someone steps forward. “Clifford Jackson Gordon! Prince of Tijuana! Protector of Rosarito! Stalwart of the Grand Prince, First Order! Order of the Black Bird, full honors! Knight of the -“ The Prince waves again, shutting him up. The retinue seems to be made up of people who watch his every move closely, and flinch when he acts. 
[23:43] <03Quaker> Abby: “I know. That’s fine. It’s just…you’re sure there’s nothing you want to tell me?” 
[23:44] <03Crion> 4Ah. The man heading up the prospective pogrom, if Cav remembers correctly.
[23:44] <03Crion> 4Yeah. He would love New York vampires.
[23:44] <03Quaker> The Prince of Tijuana: “How did you end up in Los Angeles, Baron! It doesn’t seem to attract your kind of pedigree. Naturally.” 
[23:47] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh: "Fate and duty, Prince. There was a need of our services in the Brilliant Court, a request was made, and I, being a junior associate at the firm, was obligated to fill it."
[23:47] <03Crion> 4He permits himself a bit of wryness in his smile. "As you might imagine, it has not been the best...oh, what is the term they use these days...'culture fit.'"
01[23:49] <03banana> 6KJ: "..c'mon, that's not how you do deniability. Save the friendly prying for when we get home, alright? When in Rome."
01[23:49] <03banana> "Sorry, I've spent too much time around these aristocrats to the point of being, like, unintelligible."
[23:49] <03Crion> 4It's great, right?
[23:51] <03Quaker> Gordon laughs. It’s like watching a meat section during an earthquake. “No! I don’t imagine it would be. I’ve heard a little of the Shepherds, of course. Very professional. Very capable. Not sentimental. The right kind of people. In fact…well, Tijuana has plenty of problems that could use a Shepherd. How does one contract your firm out, anyway?” 
[23:54] <03Quaker> Abby looks genuinely taken aback. “Oh.” K.J. can tell that she’s going to commit to something, and that she thinks she’s going to regret it. “Well. Ok. Just…be safe.” They stand there for a moment, under a canvas tent. “Do you want me to introduce you to the people Cavanaugh is talking to?” 
[23:55] <03Crion> 4Cav joins the laugh. "I can refer you to an account manager and have someone from our client-contact group reach out to you, but beyond that I'm actually not sure. For all the shiny new corporate America gloss, we have our obsessive secrecies same as any other group of our like -- and the employee handbook, ah, heavily incentivizes us not to freelance."
01[23:56] <03banana> 6KJ: "Sure. They're not the ones you needed extraction from, right?"
[23:58] <03Quaker> Abby: “They’re pretty bad company. But at least we’re out here. The real freaks are inside.” She looks back at Cav and the Prince. “I’ll introduce you, and then go find whatever little isle of good taste the Princess usually makes at things like this.” 
01[23:59] <03banana> "Funny, I got the impression you weren't a fan when we met at the station. She seems fine, as a hostess."
Session Time: Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 2017
[00:02] <03Quaker> Gordon: “What a shame! These fucking church people - no offense, Count, you know who I mean - are like rats. No matter how many you make an example of, more and more arrive, and then they breed, you know. You have to be firm, set an example. They could use a good Shepherding…into Hell! Haha! The last time I heard of the Shepherds out here, it was for some bloody work like that. And you didn’t hear anything about those 
[00:02] <03Quaker> people they worked on afterwards! Yes…I’ll look into it. These ones” - he gestures at his cringing retinue - “are too soft a touch.” 
[00:02] <03Crion> 4...
[00:03] <03Crion> 4Clinton maintains his smile and says something polite and deferant, because he's a professional.
[00:04] <03Quaker> Abby: “She’s fine company. I mean, I like her personally. Her circle is the only one I can stand. She just…makes headaches for me, sometimes. I’m always having to apologize for our Court when she uses one of us for some scheme.” 
[00:04] <03Crion> 4What the hell were Alicia and Peter doing out here to make this monster think the Shepherds are the answer to his need for a purge?
01[00:05] <03banana> 6KJ: "Ha. She's pretty open about her ambitions, yeah. But you can trust that we wouldn't get into anything that warrants apologies." 6In the sense that there'd be no point rendering any.
[00:09] <03Quaker> Abby sighs. “Okay. Let’s go meet the monster mash.” 
[00:12] <03Quaker> Cav’s next thought is broken by the returning Ambassador. “Prince! Count. This is K.J. Valentine, Baron of Anaheim and one of the Brilliant Court’s most brilliant young stars. You’ve met her brilliant young counterpart, Baron Cavanaugh, I see. K.J., this is Clifford Jackson Gordon, Prince of Tijuana and Lord of many other places, and Artur Korzeniowski, Count San Ysidro.” 
[00:13] <03Quaker> The Prince seems less impressed by this one. “And who is YOUR sire, young lady?” 
[00:14] <03Crion> 4Oh, this is going to go well.
01[00:21] <03banana> 6KJ beams like a flashlight. "Well. If you believe the cult's promotional materials, she was an ancient reawakened priestess of the 'Bak-Ra', the true inheritors of Egypt. But it said Casey Abadi on her employment contract, and probably her birth certificate."
01[00:22] <03banana> "I'm very interested to make your acquaintance. If we could get this kind of cross-border cooperation dayside a lot of problems would go away."
[00:24] <03Quaker> Clifford Jackson Gordon: “A…cult? Egypt? Cross-border cooperation?” He seems to be getting angrier with each question mark. “What is this, Ambassador?” 
[00:24] <03Crion> 4Cav, smoothly: "Baron Anaheim comes to us from San Francisco."
[00:26] <03Quaker> Cav sees someone he surely couldn’t have expected to see here, passing through a parting of a crowd. He’s met Presbyter Karin Sauer before, at some party, surely. She keeps walking, not seeing him.” 
[00:26] <03Quaker> Prince Gordon makes a kind of strangled screaming noise. 
[00:27] <03Crion> 4...Well, that's strange. "If you'll excuse me a moment. Prince. Ambassador. Baron."
[00:27] <03Quaker> Count San Ysidro speaks for the first time. It sounds like a rock crusher. “That is an odd place to start, if you hope to gain rank or respect in the Los Angeles Invictus. Or the Invictus of nearly anywhere. How did you manage it, Baron Anaheim?” 
[00:27] <03Crion> "And Count."
01[00:28] <03banana> 6Flatly: "I fled. As you're aware, they're a murderous bunch and they don't like cults any more than we do."
01[00:29] <03banana> "I survived and became useful. Fortunately, I can do most things better than most people. Occasionally that's enough. Takes all kinds, right?"
[00:29] <03Crion> 4Better he bows out before they have to start comparing wartime exploits, anyway.
[00:29] <03Crion> 4He's going to shadow Sauer, though not approach her in public. Not yet, at least.
[00:31] <03Quaker> The Prince: “No!” The Count: “Of course.” 
[00:32] <03Quaker> Sauer winds her way through the crowd. It’s hard to follow someone so small, since the gaps she makes close up quickly. Cav will have to try hard to keep up with her. 
01[00:35] <03banana> 6KJ: "Tell me, your Highness- how have you maintained such standards in Tijuana? Have you defeated entropy, rendering all change avoidable?"
[00:38] <03Quaker> The Prince rises. “Please, Baron. Share your insights with us.” 
[00:40] <03Quaker> Cav does more than try: he succeeds! Sauer, for all her quickness, is kept in sight the whole way. He even follows her when she disappears in a flicker of shadow, appearing a few strides later near the castle, slipping into an empty and darkened parlor. She stands with her hands in her pockets, waiting, admiring a painting of some woman in armor. 
[00:43] <03Crion> 4Cav will slide up alongside her, but far enough way to be unnoticed in his approach and unthreatening on his reveal. "Who is she?"
01[00:45] <03banana> 6KJ takes a glass from a passing servant's hand and drinks whatever was in it. "If you're positing a world where the only Kindred who take a place in society are the ones already occupying it, there's no special insight needed to disappoint you. I'll just wait a few hundred years, your Highness, and you'll be ash or buried in dreams."
01[00:46] <03banana> 6To San Ysidro, murmured: "My apologies." 6It's probably about to be clear what for.
[00:46] <03Quaker> Presbyter Sauer jumps all the same. “Oh!” When she realizes who has seen her, she does a double-take. “Baron Cavanaugh? Oh, uh. Um. I don’t know. I just liked the, uh…art. The brush strokes are very…technically proficient.” 
[00:47] <03Crion> 4Cavanaugh shrugs. "I wouldn't know. What brings you to the party, Presbyter?"
[00:48] <03Quaker> Sauer looks around. “Sightseeing.” 
[00:48] <03Crion> 4He's not going to ask why she's in San Diego. She can't answer that question both safely and honestly on these grounds, and Cav's pretty sure he's got the general sense of it either way.
[00:52] <03Quaker> The Prince’s broad face darkens as K.J. speaks. By the time she’s finished, his teeth are bared, and drawing blood from his lower lips. “You! A few hundred years! Now here is the Los Angeles I know all too well. You people….you aberrations. You traitors. You self-promoters and malcontents! You screeching, swarthy apes!” Abby is gently pushing K.J. away. 
[00:54] <03Crion> 4So glad to have been tabbed as 'one of the good ones' by San Diego's resident vampire Nazi.
[00:54] <03Crion> 4Well. Tijuana's.
01[00:54] <03banana> 6Swarthy, are you fucking kidding me "Thanks, Abby. Some pleasant gardens through here, right?"
[00:56] <03Crion> 4To Sauer: "I think I saw enough of the city last time I was here to last me another, oh, thirty or forty years. However long it takes the blood to thin. But here I stand nonetheless."
01[00:56] <03banana> 6If Gordon is letting them go, they'll go. Otherwise KJ had better vanish entirely at this point. She wouldn't even trust herself NOT to escalate.
[00:56] <03Quaker> “You frauds and hucksters! You freaks and mongrel-lovers! Replace me? You’ll…me? Us? The eternal, unyielding bulwark of God, of order, of law, of good? You, replace me? I can trace MY heritage back four THOUSAND years, Baron! Each of my ancestors knew the strength of the Invictus, the strength of a will that resists the weak and the wailing hordes, who would erase a millennia of hard-won peace for a second of mindless 
[00:56] <03Quaker> pleasure- YOU???” 
[00:57] <03Quaker> Well, he doesn’t follow them as they leave. 
01[00:57] <03banana> 6Quietly: "I mean, he's right about the Bay Area."
[00:57] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Why are you here?” She doesn’t sound accusatory, just curious. 
[00:59] <03Crion> 4Drolly: "The Seneschal thought we could use the vacation. Unless you mean the party in specific, in which case I have to stay I'm still asking that myself."
[01:00] <03Crion> "Plate armor does my profile no favors."
[01:00] <03Quaker> Abby: “Well, Tijuana’s overrated, anyway.” She’s led them to a break in the crowd. Left to the lit section of the manor on the ground floor, right to a darkened wing and an empty stretch of grass overlooking the lake. Which way? 
[01:01] <03Quaker> Sauer looks like she’s thinking. Eventually: “You’re friends with Presbyter Vincent, right?” 
[01:02] <03Crion> "I'd like to think so," 4Cav says. "She always got on better with Rollie, though."
[01:03] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Why are you friends with her?” 
[01:05] <03Crion> "I've got two answers to that, one which you might like and the other one which you won't, and I'm not sure which is the real reason. Maybe both are."
[01:06] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Now’s the time for honesty.” 
[01:07] <03Crion> "The first is, given that she was a source of assistance and power outside the formal chain of Invictus command while I was a deputy and now represents my direct territorial neighbor as a baron, being friends with her is merely good politics. I certainly have enough enemies in the Brilliant Court without running afoul of the priests.
[01:09] <03Crion> "The second is that she reminds me of something I've never seen before; an odd, disquieting sensation -- perhaps an echo in the blood, perhaps just a strange deja vu. A vampire with her kindness and grace -- and I mean that in the religious sense -- is a thing both my lives have told me should not be."
[01:09] <03Crion> "But then, my religion was always money."
[01:10] <03Quaker> Sauer relaxes. “Oh, okay. Hey, do you like the Bishops, or the San Diego Court?” 
01[01:13] <03banana> 6KJ's answer will depend on whether Wilson's made his presence known yet. This might be a good time to slip away from Abby and into the bowels of the party.
[01:14] <03Quaker> Abby: “Oh, that reminds me. Where’s Baron Frost gotten to? Was he with you?” 
[01:15] <03Crion> 4Cav purses his lips. "I've no use for the former and with one conspicuous exception in the Princess of La Jolla, I prefer how my first interaction with the San Diego Court went as compared to this burgeoning horror show."
[01:15] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's done what he usually does at parties, which is park in one spot and talk to people who come to him. This is so much harder sober.
[01:17] <03Quaker> In fact, nobody comes to talk to him. Lords and ladies react with shock at his uncovered face and walk away muttering. 
[01:18] <03Crion> 4Fun crowd.
[01:18] <03Quaker> Sauer: “Nice. Well, you probably won’t -“ There’s a knock on a door leading further into the house, and the Presbyter turns to look. “Yes?” 
[01:19] <03Quaker> The door swings open slightly. A porcelain mask peeks through the gap. “We’re here.” It notices Cav. “Do you…require assistance.” 
[01:21] <03Crion> 4Are they asking Sauer or Cav?
[01:23] <03Quaker> It’s asking Sauer. Sauer: “No, he’s from up north. He’s with me.” She fishes a piece of paper from her pocket and reads from it. “1360 Pepper Tree Road. Dig under the lemon tree in the back. Should be 25 pieces, 5,000 rounds. Some special ones, I don’t know how many they put in. And five pounds of plastics. So be careful when you dig.” 
[01:23] <03Quaker> The mask: “Yours is behind the painting.” The door closes, quietly. 
[01:24] <03Quaker> Sauer looks at the painting again. “It’s pretty big. Help me take it off the wall?” 
[01:25] <03Crion> "Of course." 4Hopefully namechecking -- well, title-checking -- the Princess along with his stated feelings on the Bishops and San Diego have tipped Sauer to the vague outline, at least, of what he's doing at the party. It would be so gauche to actually say it out loud. Bad op sec, too.
[01:27] <03Quaker> With the big oil painting lifted out of the way, there’s a hollow in the wall, holding a wide plastic case. Sauer pops the hinges and places it on the floor, kneeling in front of it. “Let’s see…” 
[01:28] <03Quaker> There’s what looks like close to $15,000 in bills, and something placed in foam holders: they look like four D-Cell batteries, covered in a dried, brownish substance. 
[01:30] <03Quaker> Sauer: “I get the sense that we run in the same circles. Maybe our ends just hadn’t met yet.” 
[01:32] <03Crion> 4Cav laughs and shakes his head. "Perhaps. But I've been...more distant towards the Prysbeter, and her parish, than I should have been since the partitioning. Maybe I'll start dropping by more often."
[01:32] <03Quaker> The only person to approach Wilson turns out to be one of the Nosferatu. It’s not until she speaks that he realizes it’s Sara, the one he’s been working with for a day and his assigned doppelganger. “Hello, Baron. Are you ready to start? We should find the others.” 
[01:33] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson ought to be miffed, but this isn't even the first time his understudy was a girl. "Sure. Enjoying yourself?"
[01:33] <03Quaker> Cav has seen these before. They’re what Rollie had in his flashlight. The brown stuff is supposed to be the blood of a martyr. 
[01:35] <03Quaker> Sara’s mask has a red stone under her left eye. Wilson could swear that for a moment, it gleams. “Yes. When I meditate on the fact that I can help others escape from this place.” 
[01:35] <03Crion> 4Glancing at the batteries: "Now there's a useful tool."
[01:36] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson: "You know, if any of you want a vacation from this, I've got a big place up in LA."
[01:37] <03@VoxPVoxD> "I've always got guests and hardly ever see them. It's a good place to avoid everyone for a while."
[01:37] <03Quaker> Sara: “Thank you. I’m going to be staying with the rest for a while, once we arrive. I’ll visit if I get the chance.” 
[01:38] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson motions for her to lead on.
[01:40] <03Quaker> Yesterday, as the barons went over the plan, the question came up: The Nosferatu are talented mimics, but they can’t provide much convincing depth if pointed questions start being asked. Will one of the three remain with the decoys of the other two, to provide cover? Or will all three be sneaking around? 
[01:41] <03Crion> 4If it's the former, Cav's the easy choice. He's got the skillset and is the Right Sort of Fellow, You Know, Just Has That 'It' Quality for this crowd of revanchist freaks.
[01:42] <03@VoxPVoxD> 10Wilson's happy to hang back, but you probably want the decoy to be the guy who can't turn invisible.
03[01:44] * banana is now known as banana|peels
[01:47] <03Quaker> They talked it over. Cav would be the right sort of guy, it’s true…but Wilson has spent the most time navigating parties, and knows the best ways to bullshit away attention. Sara leads Wilson to where Abby and K.J. are. 
[01:48] <03Quaker> Sauer closes the case. “I’ll be heading back to L.A. now. You want me to take anything with me? I won’t be searched. Or I can take a message to someone, I guess.” 
[01:50] <03Crion> 4Cav shakes his head. "Nothing comes to mind."
[01:52] <03Quaker> She picks the case up. “Alright. See you soon.” She leaves the room, passing a robed, masked figure. It’s Alberto, the Nosferatu Cav has been working with. “Baron. We should begin. The others are nearby.” 
[01:53] <03Crion> 4Cav: "Lead the way."
[01:56] <03Quaker> He does, and once they’ve collected the rest of the barons and Sara, the little group is led to a quiet, darkened portion of the first floor. A door is opened, and then they find themselves in a large, empty room filled with sinks and stainless steel appliances. The blueprints they’ve all been committing to memory said it was an auxiliary kitchen. 
[01:59] <03Quaker> Alberto: “So. One last time. Baron Frost, myself, and Sara remain on the first floor. The others move upstairs and replace the item with the forgery. If no alarm is raised, the others return to the first floor, and the night proceeds as normal. If an alarm is raised, we withdraw Baron Frost and the doppelgangers back under the Princess’s protection, and you two will have to make your way to the other side of the lake, where 
[01:59] <03Quaker> the Princess’s people will pick you up.” 
[02:00] <03Quaker> The light in the kitchen bends, and Cav and K.J. are looking at copies of Cav and K.J. 
[02:00] <03Quaker> Cav asks Cav, in Cav’s voice. “Are we ready?” 
[02:01] <03Crion> 4So weird. "Think so."
[02:03] <03Quaker> Then the three decoys leave by a side door. 
[02:03] <03Quaker> The clock begins for Cav and K.J. 
[02:03] <03Quaker> NEXT WEEK: Heisting!
