<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The sun is rising over the desert. Spreading light reveals open-cut pits in the earth, great derricks and platforms, a complex of concrete painted flaking green and surrounded by radio towers.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> All the lights at Baikonur are off but for two buildings. One is a staff canteen where the tail-end of a party emits flickers of celebration and music which drifts over the empty launchpads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_aWGakJe4</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Around the other side of a missile test range is the secondary administration building, dedicated to Interkosmos - a hypothetical dream of cooperation which has yet to find any cooperators. They use it for now as storage and for this interrogation.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There are two men from the Party, tired and ruffled by long hours of questioning. It seems to have worn more on them than their captive. In keeping with the Hegemonic Ministry's strange practices, one of them isn't even <span class='i '>mistika</span> - a mage. Otherwise there's no visible difference between them.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first man: "So you watched the rocket, without proper protective goggles. You saw its concealment from the eyes of America and God. And you say you saw.. something else, in that lack which should have been absolute."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second man: "Decreed free of information or perception."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Days later on the other side of the Iron Curtain, Cleaner gets the news from the Brigadier-Sublime.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>What time is it?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Comfortably post-prandial. You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The fuck is a--</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Mid-afternoon?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors.</span> "My people."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." <span class='c14'>Cleaner uncrosses his legs.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "So it goes."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited.</span> "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. </span>"That's all correct." <span class='c10'>Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't <span class='u '>all</span> be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>So as not to create any misperception of charity:</span> "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. </span><span class='c1'>“Sorry,”</span><span class='c13'> he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> white shirts and white shorts. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Sounds bad." <span class='c14'>Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He stands.</span> "That be all?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for <span class='u '>the</span> Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. </span>"I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> what I saw as another sun."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. </span>“Good evening.” <span class='c13'>The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. </span>"I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “So sorry. No speak English.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must <span class='i '>not</span> succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Mm. Well. She’s seen it before. If there were any danger, she’d know, as she’s seen him deal with it before. There isn’t, so they’ll both stand silently, waiting for the messenger to resolve itself into something meaningful. While he waits, he chews on his gum. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "Second. Hegemon knew about this before the Tetrarchs, before your own hierarchy. Not the first time that's happened apparently. Needs to stop. As a matter of professional courtesy I won't try to estimate whether Panopticon might be riddled with spies."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Third. Have you ever heard of the Invisible Order?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "I feel driven to speak now for cooperation's sake." <span class='c10'>Perhaps unusual to the interrogators is that Epiphany hasn't once asked </span><span class='i c10'>them</span><span class='c10'> a question. He has been the very model of incurious patience.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Orient's brief patience bears fruit- maybe sensing its limit, the wrinkled prophet backs off a step and fixes him with a glare before speaking more firmly. "No good in the eyes of God, the Eye of the gods. We won't have a prayer as of four P.M. March third T minus zero. Our final warning, watchers watched."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner never walked out.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Ynkblot needs to learn to calm down.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "You - two? you? - need to get your ass or asses to Florida several days too late to meet the man with the bird jacket, bird man, third man, triply absurd man."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He listens in silence, nodding and making non-comittal noises as appropriate.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> First interrogator: "We always appreciate cooperation, comrade."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Second interrogator: "It's all we can ask for."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Second interrogator, after a brief pause: "The operation of the rocket engine upon the air, upon space itself. Describe its action again?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I see. Thank you.” <span class='c13'>Claudio wonders where in the world it was that the Eye had offended the God, if that’s what he meant. He’ll wait for the other man to stop before asking.</span> “Do you have any specific dates or instructions?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>In fact, he’ll look for them himself, in the man’s mind. How is it? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The prophet's mind is a mess. You can see the signs of deliberate damage - his mentality has been torn apart at some point, either by an enemy or the man himself. Probably best not to think about it? But in those ragged channels, there's something.. an entry point for divinity? He sees the future, and probably not of his own volition.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Unsentimentally:</span> "Pentacle cabal. Operate in Orange and Brevard Counties. Possible ties to Miami Consilium. Possible ties to." <span class='c14'>He doesn't trail off, just stops talking. After a short pause, he rephrases.</span> "Interesting how they operate in our territory. Merits a closer look."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Noisy. Inconvenient."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>That’s unfortunate. Claudio reaches out and brushes the man’s mind with a restorative intent. Does anything stop him? It would be a cruelty to make someone like this. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Prophet: "Go take a hike. Or a cruise. Can't lose. You can't lose if you invest in the <span class='i '>Pharoah's Daughter</span>, Yarmouth Line, out of George Town on Sunday and two weeks to Port Canaveral. Because of the market, you know, the devil you know, better to ride a boat than serve a meal."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> He freezes.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The damage is deep enough that the original owner of this mind is effectively dead, but you can heal structure, impose something a bit more like regular function. Some of those tears close up. Shards of prophecy remain embedded like splinters, mental welts forming around them, but the patch job could last a long time, and he's old.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Epiphany: </span>"As the report indicated, the primary device was an 11A57 functioning within parameters. All engines operational, no deviation in gross mass, normal burn time for all stages. There was an aberrant visual distortion, an apparent degradation of substance at the operant temperature, not in the rocket but in the air. If you asked me to be lyrical, it brought to mind a film </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> reel that was melted through by projector running hot."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "This distortion yielded to the astrosymbolic phenomenon I have already described."</p>

They've compromised the safehouse at Port Canaveral, threats of an attack. So item three is deal with that. We have names: Wildchurch, Cortex, Semiramus, Fixer. Perhaps Rockstar.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio will make the restorations as strong and deep as he can. Better - wait, two weeks to Florida? How many stops is it making? Isaias and his family are in Spain for the summer, so he’ll have to call tonight and let him know…</span>”Thank you, my friend. Would you like anything for your troubles? We were just on our way to dinner. You’re welcome to join us. Or a hotel room, if you’d like.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "Oh, you'll have numbers on your side. At least five of Lewis's people and a few others in the area. The two thousand or so soldiers, scientists and journalists might get in the way."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner just stares at him for a moment, then thinks better of clarifying that he meant informants or other privileged contacts, not mere lackeys. Instead:</span> "Is this a kill order, a capture order, a scatter order, or my discretion?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The interrogators speak over each other for a moment. "Please do not be lyrical-" "An interesting image, but-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first one resumes. "But a deviation <span class='i '>did</span> occur. Will you submit your memory for examination?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "Cleaner, it's a desk job. This is a <span class='u '>promotion</span>. Administration. Your task will be to make everything run smoothly, and if that involves killing you can order yourself or others to do it. Again, I suggest Trajan there."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "For handover on the local business - is there anyone you're tracking, ops in progress, anything Caveat doesn't have?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>His discretion, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner:</span> "No."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>To be more precise:</span> "Caveat has everything."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Epiphany: </span>"Would you accept a display instead?"</p>

Being able to leave at all is a minor miracle, let alone on this short notice; the small jet he's in doesn't *look* capable of international flights, and indeed according to the steward earlier this is not an international airport.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There are just five other passengers, some probably Seers and some probably KGB. The plane's interior is mostly dark now that the sun is setting outside.</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The steward's back, handing Henrik a little plastic bag full of documents. "Sir, your passport and biography. Would you like Baikal or orange juice?"</p>

It's almost dark outside and Henrik feels a little queasy as he carries his belongings down the steps from the small Sukhoi.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> No stars visible above. A slightly sweet smell in the air. It's crisp, and in the distance he can hear the noise of cars. American cars.</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Caveat moves closer to Cleaner. Looks like she's unarmed - not that she needs to be, but it always helps. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> This doesn't seem to be a busy airport, though it's gleaming new. Henrik's anonymous fellow travellers bid him anonymous farewells at the unmanned gate, dispersing in various directions - he sees one lighted concourse with people at its end, a janitor moving along the wall between here and there. Everything is very modern and expensive.</p>

Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” <span class='c13'>Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk.</span> “Is this what you wanted?” <span class='c13'>he asks Sam. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Oddly, that one was <span class='i '>almost</span> true. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient turns to Gary.</span> “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It is very clear that Sam expected this.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Sorry about that, yeah?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. </span>“It’s alright, Sam. I don’t have any intention of turning you in. You can consider me a friend. I promise that I have your well-being in mind.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief. I thought.." He's kicking the fallen money into a little pile behind him. "Dunno what I thought. Fucking weird that Gary turned us in, though. Don't expect another share now, Gary."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “How long have you been running this scam?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Just a couple of years since Yarmouth opened out of Port Canaveral! There are always a few people who want a cheap ride back to the US of A. You know when it works <span class='i '>really</span> well?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Shut up!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "It works <span class='i '>really</span> well when they don't have a visa either. The guy at the docks tells them it won't be checked at the point, and then I regret to inform them.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I really do regret it, you know?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sam, please! There’s no need for harsh language here. I imagine it works very well then, Gary. It sounds like it would work very well on very vulnerable people like that. I imagine they would be very scared.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Who are you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> He's got the presence of mind to be standing on the cash, at least. The ship creaks and turns a little, sending pills and bits of glass across the floor.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I’m an importer-exporter, headed towards Florida to try and set up my business there. Before I decided to emigrate, I lived in Milan with my wife. Before I came to America, I was spending time with her on vacation. The nature of my work means that I won’t see her for quite some time.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Orient taps his wallet. “This was all the money I had on me. It was all I had to try and make a life for myself in America. You’ve taken about half. I don’t think my business would be able to survive on what I have left. I’m not sure what I would do if you kept it.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "That's a real shame" and obviously completely true. "Best of luck with your uh, venture. I mean we're both businessmen here in a way, right."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Sam! We can't keep it, are you nuts?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “No, we’re not both businessmen. I’m afraid that you’re trying to rationalize taking advantage of people. Do you think you’re doing that? Taking advantage of people just like you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "What, so some wop wants to start a business instead of going home to his wife and somehow that's our problem? This is America, or it will be in a couple of days."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "The business thing isn't real, that's not the point, the point is you're being a dick-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "No, obviously it is- you want to make a charitable donation to some guy's commercial venture? What?? Are you an MBA now?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient holds up a hand.</span> “Hold on, Gary. It’s alright. You don’t need to insult Sam.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Oh, sure. As long as he gives the money back, though."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "This is insane! You stole it in the first place, you talked him into giving it over!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Gary, I appreciate it. But please let me speak to Sam without interruption. I would really appreciate it. I know how much you must want to speak.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "What have you done to us? You're so.. honest. I can't stop giving a shit about your vacation and your wife. Why would I give a shit?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sam, sit down. I’m not going to try and make some sudden move for the money you’re worried about.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary doesn't say anything, but he looks smug. Obviously he's pretty happy that you've pulled one over on him.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam sits, then bends to the side and picks up the cash, putting it back on the table where it originally was. "Shit, nearly cut myself."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I'm going to have to clean all this up before the next supply drop.. quartermaster's supposed to keep a clean office. I can trust you with that, right? That I'm the quartermaster?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Yes, you can. How much money have you taken in with this scam?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Uh, I feel like it should be more.. we've got at least a couple dozen people, but the money always seems to go as fast as it comes in. All those bars on the islands, and the girls, you know. This is a great job, as long as you've got spending money."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Yeah, it is. I should've picked a better partner though."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Everything's at tourist prices. Lots of rich assholes on these cruises - present company excepted - if you think about it, we cheat the ones who're cheating themselves."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Have all of your targets been rich? It seems like not all of them could be, or your threat of contacting the police wouldn’t be quite so powerful.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful. But it also seems as if there are easier ways to find that. Ways that don’t involve hurting people like this. And it seems like for all the money, you both have rather severe reservations about what you find yourselves doing.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Maybe I shoulda been a magician."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient adjusts Sam. He feels a tinge of guilt. With a little bit more patience, with a little bit more persuasion, he could have secured the man’s express consent. But he doesn’t trust his own persuasiveness. Oh well. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "That sounds like actual work. Look, why don't we just-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "?" His former confederate has a one billion-yard stare.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> He's looking into a world where things can- must- be different.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam shifts his chair back like the money in front of him is something repulsive, making a little squeaking noise. "Why don't we just.. find a better way. Find something, anything that doesn't do this to people."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Magic shows sound like a healthy creative outlet, Gary. I think you should look into it.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I think that’s for the best, Sam. Most people can’t enjoy money if they feel too guilty to use it.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "That was just an idea, but-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Any idea has to be better than this. It doesn't matter so much what *we* get out of it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I suspect you’ll get more out of it than you think.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The man keeps shaking his head a little like he's trying to clear away an unpleasant noise or a clump of earwax. Unfortunately it's Most Of The Thoughts And Impulses He's Ever Had.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Maybe it's the noise of surf against the beach.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient stands up. </span>“Well, I don’t want to keep you from your duties. Gary, Sam, I think that you two know as well as I do that your swindling days are over, and that we’re all glad that’s the case. May I take my money back?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Hey, I wasn't objecting." At least recently.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sam?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Yes! Yes. Um, good luck with your business. I really hope it isn't impacted by- are you gonna be ok?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Weird how most people just go through life hoping the world will get better instead of <span class='b '>making</span> it into a better place. It may take a lifetime to find out why.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I’ll be fine.” <span class='c13'>Orient puts the money back in his wallet.</span> “Are there any other people you’ve taken money from still on the ship? If there are, I suggest you return their money and apologize for the mistake. And I guarantee that you will feel richer afterwards. There is no amount of money that can replace the knowledge that in the truest sense, you try at all times to be a good person.” <span class='c13'>He shakes both their hands. </span>“Thank</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> you for talking, Gary. Sam. I have complete confidence in both of you. I think that today will mark the beginning of a happier time in both of your lives.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary happily and Sam with some trepidation shake, see their guest out, and start cleaning up the room and their acts. The guy on the dock sure is going to be disappointed.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio returns to his cabin and knocks. Isaias answers, holding a sleeping orange tabby cat in the crook of his arm. They speak rapidly in Italian once Claudio closes the door behind him. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> (What did you do?) (Talked to one, had to tamper a bit with the empathy of the other.) (Did it cost you?) (A little. Nothing to worry about.) </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Isaias rolls his eyes. </span>(He would have understood just as well if we had thrown him overboard.) </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> If more briefly.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio shrugs.</span> (I’m sure that my patience will run out sometime in the future. There will be occasions to act irresponsibly. Do you feel like a match of badminton? They put up a court on the uppermost deck.) </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>15:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The <span class='i '>Pharoah's Daughter</span> steams onward, out of the Bahamas toward Florida coast. By the time it reaches Port Canaveral, it's too late- they've put men in space. But at least Orient will get to see what happens next.</p>
