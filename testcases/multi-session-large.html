Upon its prow perches a rampant wind dragon, her four wings folded across her body and an invincible chrysalis of swirling air sheathing her from feathered head to taloned toe. Between her and you are a trio of her servitors, ancient, feathered wind bears whose </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>martial arts thus far have proved next to useless against a quartet of solar exalted.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The dragon's mad laughter has died down for the moment - all there is to hear is the howling of the storm and the clash of battle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir holds Iscariot, now a lance, across her body, guarding. Waiting.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Two of the bears have been soundly defeated - they've drawn back into a sort of meditative repose, their bodies diffuse and translucent. One yet menaces you!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Tatsuya's essence blade comes arcing down at the last of the bears to remain dangerous, but it goes skating off the creature's thick, partly-feathered hide! For its part, the bear claps its paws together, draws a deep breath in through its snout, and then </span><span class='b c12'>roars!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>An unavoidable (certainly if you're mortal) shockwave of concussive force goes rippling outward!

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Still fatigued from the onslaught on the dragon herself, Tatsuya lands merely a glancing blow, but fortunately was already rolling out of the way of the counterattack. Small victories.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The third of the creatures is visibly spent by the exertion.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>The wind also fails to ruffle Eikichi's hair.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya puts up both arms in a cross and stands against the wind. It buffets him about, but he's right back where he was with no injuries to speak of.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom turns for a brief moment, horrified.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's faced the best this thing has to offer. She hears someone hit the deck behind her, but in that moment, the Sun comes out -- somehow -- from behind the clouds above and hits her face...and tip of her spear.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Then there's a sound like a thunderclap and she's leapt across the deck, moving faster than any eye can track, cutting through the wind with a boom of her own, and there's another whirlwind on the board of the Heavensward: furious, lethal, and solar.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Just like that she's cut the thing to pieces, then shoots into the sky and drives down with her final strike -- not doing any more damage to the already-destroyed dragon, but dissapting it, scattering its wispy pieces.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Garuda's laughing and laughing and laughing - and then she's not, because she's too busy folding her wings and lashing out with her talons and summoning shields of solid wind against her impossibly persistent harrier. By the end, though, when her wings have been pried apart like some mollusc's shell and her aura tunneled through and her heart bared, she's begun laughing all over </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>again.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>At last, Ir drives straight through the monster, which explodes into a storm of grey-green wind essence that expands and unravels all across the Heavensward's deck. Around you, the dark storm you've been trapped in thins and lightens and slowly opens itself entirely, allowing you to right the ship and get your bearings. The ship itself is in fine shape - the sails are a little ragged </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>around the edges and there are some unfortunate claw marks across the deck, but it's nothing that can't be repaired or polished over.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Indeed, the only significant change is that one of the three ancient, ghostly bears is still sitting at the ship's prow, asleep.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir pauses for a moment, tip of Iscariot buried in the deck, then thumps heavily down into a sitting position, then lies back on the deck, arms spread wide, exhausted.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> A young girl, peering up from a black raincoat two sizes too small.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>So he does. It's fine scotch. Nothing special.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Ying hurries after Sondok to check on the mounts and their passengers. </span>"Hey! Are you okay?"</p>

The creature doesn't bleed properly - what looks like </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>darkness, flecked with stars and multicolored bubbles, is kind of oozing upwards out of the wound and dissipating into the air around it.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ying works quickly and efficiency, and that's a good thing since such things as gauze and bandages are also on the 'to resupply' list.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Once he's been attended to, she patches up the woman as well. The lacerations on her back give Ying pause, but soon enough she's got them bandaged up, any bleeding stopped and the wounds ready to begin the healing process. Finally, Ying has time to talk to them - she spent the entire medical procedure explaining what she was doing to them and why, calming any fears that may arise.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>over by the Realm.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The first course is Midnight Eggs. You scramble four eggs for every guest with diced peppercheese, a splash of milk, and copious ground pepper, lightly salt to taste, and serve. That's fine. Then they get to sleep, while Ir fires up the oven to precook some of the boar meet while outside, she sets up a firepit and a spit. This is an old technique: Pneuman Ham, In-and-Out Style. You </span></p>

A different inside view on it? This is going to give him a headache. After some brief stretches and a few practice strikes to recall his martial arts, he joins the group at brunch.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Combine that with a formidable brush salad, some more eggs -- Two-Eyed Style, this time -- and some hashed and browned potatoes, and you've got yourself a hell of a meal.</span></p>

Plus, the Realm's there to curtail </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>the expanse of the fae - the local Wyld Hunt's an extremely literal one, and needs a lot of support from the locals to continue operating at peak efficiency, supposedly.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>So the upshot is that a lot of people are starving until they help to dig and drag ore, and the satrap runs the place with military exactitude, and the taxes are just going up and up with the increased needs of the Realm and the ever-bolder fae and so on.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi's bored now. He'll go off and work on other stuff and let the others interrogate the refugees.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Those don't really sound like questions Ir is interested in.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>There are a number of refugee communities in and around the hedgehog mountains which are doing their best, but it's really hard to sustain yourself when you haven't got both a coastline and a lot of open fields to work off of. Eggs Ir will definitely be able to barter for if she approaches the right settlements, but good freaking luck with grains of basically any kind.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>In the satrapy itself there's a thriving market for all sorts of goods, both finished food and raw cooking materials certainly included, but that would mean marching right into what's like 40% a Cathak military base and hoping they'll take your coin.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>There are also rumors that the fae have their own grand market, up in the sky.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Well, eggs and probably salt can probably be traded for with the people living in and around these mountains, but if you want real spices or a proper selection of herbs and other greens you'll need a better selection.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well. That goes against all his instincts. Titles are easier to remember for him than names, somehow. He won't be forgetting her's, however.</span> "As you wish, Leisurely."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The ushers seem to tell who They are instinctively - instead of going with the rest of the crowd filing into the rows, a velvet rope is unclasped and taken away, and they’re led down the hallway beyond. The room they’re led into is large enough to hold 20, with benches and couches - and two doors lay beyond. Box 30 and 31. The later arrivals will see a handsome young man and a slightly older woman, the latter looking vaguely more </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> uncomfortable than the former. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It takes KJ a moment to realise what's going on with what she likes to think of as her unwelcome visitor.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Which is funny, because Cav got that word by googling for synonyms for 'discerning' earlier in the night.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He replaces it into his pocket. It's a social thing, after all. </span>"Okay, if the rest are like that maybe this will be survivable."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Looks like kind of a bro. He's staring at Rosa, which completes the image.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She moves with the practiced ease of someone who has shaken ten thousand hands. “Thank you all so much for coming.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will follow Leisurely's lead here, assuming she hasn't slipped away, but he'd probably prefer the quiet room so he can just spend the night on his phone, both checking the local news site for Laguna (which he's surreptitiously financing through Buchanon as a gracious anonymous donor) and any number of local crime blogs/Twitter accounts.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Of course.” Clarabelle surreptitiously points and names as they pass. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely hasn’t slipped away. In fact, he can see her entering Box 30. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ah well. Socializing it is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> If he follows, he’ll see her take a seat in the very rear corner of the box, away from the rest. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As soon as they enter into the boxes far above the hall, it becomes harder to hear themselves over the murmur of the crowd below, and the amelodic droning of the orchestra tuning their instruments. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The rest: Cav recognizes Count Sherman Ma, from the other parties, checking his phone. A chair has been removed so that Guadalupe Ochoa’s wheelchair can fit into the aisle, and she’s leaning over the side, making whispering conversation with a younger woman dressed in greens, both of them occasionally laughing. There’s a handful of other Barons he might know by sight or reputation, too, but nobody else he’s closed to. And no Bren or </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Burne to be found. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> And in the middle, of the seats, letting the sound and activity move around them, sit Prince Bailey and the Countess-Palatine, holding hands as they watch the musicians prepare. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely looks up in surprise. “Hello, Wilson. I didn’t expect to see you out.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Heh. You and me both. Have you met KJ Valentine? She got the good half of Anaheim. KJ, this is Leisurely Foster, an old friend."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle accepts the compliment. “We just have to remember that we came here to do something besides watch the ballet, Deacon.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>There's one answer to KJ's question, right?

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Yeah, yeah. 'Course."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As Cav stares, the Prince leans over and whispers something in his wife’s ear. She laughs, and then leans over to kiss him on the cheek. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>And then KJ and Leisurely are shaking hands alone.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The conversation takes a lighter turn after that, and Tatsuya spends a while talking with Eikichi as they drink. It's good to hang out again. As himself, not as the other self that he also is - that got complicated. Anyway. After a while, he says his goodbyes and makes his way back towards his room, a little unsteady on his feet and a nearly-empty bottle of "fire ball" in his pocket.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Someone's coming out of Eikichi's room and almost bumps into Tatsuya!</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Her eyes widen and then narrow, leaving her back at her resting face. "Are you ill?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> "What're you doin' in - nah, nah, just been drinking a bit. Talking. And drinking. Prob'ly shoulda stopped a bit ago, but whoopsy~!" <span class='c6'>He focuses in on the demon. </span>"What were you doin' in there?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Security. You need water."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He nods agreeably. </span>"Yeah. That sounds good. Security, and the water too."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok puts a steadying claw on Tatsuya's shoulder and marches him firmly to the lounge, where there are barrels of fresh rainwater.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "It's only just dark. How long have you been drinking?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Most emotion I ever heard out of you was when you called me 'thief'. Second most was when you called Ying 'thief'. So. What's up with that?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok: "How long have you been a thief?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"So since I was like, four I guess?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "So you know perfectly well why I don't like thieves."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "It's the same reason nobody likes thieves."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He shrugs. </span>"Not sayin' anyone's in love with the concept. Not even other thieves. But for you, it brings out some, some extra vi-tri-ol." <span class='c6'>He takes his time pronouncing that last word.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok makes a face at the word 'vitriol'. "What's that to you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"It's like some kind of extra special bonus hatred, I think. I made Eikichi explain it to me a long time ago. I dunno, I'm just curious, people have their reasons for stuff, and I guess - huh." <span class='c6'>He moves to get some kind of snack food. The water needs something to go with it, after all. </span>"I guess it bothered me a little. Reminded me of old times."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Have you ever made anything?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"You too, huh? Ying left me a note saying I need a hobby. She wants to make clothing 'n shit."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> "Oh, right, and the glib answer is 'mistakes,' but not really. Not yet anyway."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok: "It enriches you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Enriches how? Coupla meanings for that word."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Only in the general sense of being a disappointment. Havin' someone look at you and just be mad. Whoops, think I've arrived at the melancholy stage of drunk."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok: "You have nothing to fear from me."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He chuckles wheezily. </span>"So bad."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok: "Tell that one to a lot of girls?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He shrugs. </span>"Not much for me there. No family.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Sondok: "You could convince them to go somewhere else."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Hm?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "You don't have to go to Nexus. You're weeks away and you have a vessel that can go to any point in Creation."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He shakes his head. </span>"It's important to me that I go back.

I'm just worried I won't like what I find."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Why?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Why's it important to me to go back, or why won't I like what I find?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, Eikichi has quite a trip ahead of him, because while the Stormwind Rider is incredibly fast, it doesn't actually fly that high. Unless the rakshastan the sorcerer seeks is a mere two or four stories off the ground, he won't be able to just sail on up there on his own; his best bet is to follow the exact opposite of Wern and Freda's advice, skating along the highest mountains </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>he can find and looking for trouble at their peaks.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Yeah. Eikichi assumes that there must be some way to access the rakshastan without flying directly up to it.</span></p>

They go hiking off into the brush, taking a series of circuitous paths around the mountains that prevent them from drifting either too high or too low. Lots of sun-dappled fallen leaves, dry branches crunching underfoot, and glimpses of probably-dangerous wild fauna out of the </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>corners of the eye await them.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ami, yes, since Ami seems to not notice the grade of the slope she's on and can just walk right on top of the fallen leaves that occasionally obscure dangerous pits in the ground or whatever. Errant will need some skilled handling.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>As the solars travel, they're given to rack their brains and organize their thoughts with regards to the fae.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, there's a lot to do today.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Is there? What’s she doing?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He's out the door soon, impeccably dressed and scrolling through his calendar app. Trattoria Impresario, a hot new high-end place that does very traditional Italian cuisine but has gotten its best press for a wonderful, inspired Italian-Mexican fusion menu courtesy of its head chef, a young Mexican woman whose name he absolutely cannot recall.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He's still wearing the same suit he wore to the ballet. Tommy pulls out a chain of paper towels, dabs them with water, and tries to do triage.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Of course! There's a lot to do every night - read reports, keep up with the troops, donate blood. Take blood donations. Study ('isn't it 2013'? come on.), patrol.. and give Baron Hollywood a call. All this while looking good. Maybe some kind of thicker blouse, in case it rains again. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Also: learn to shoot, have these bullets looked into, um.. right, embed an exploit on her Twitter profile. There need to be more hours between sunset and sunrise.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's up at the crack of dusk. He let the girls take him back to the place in the Hills instead of dropping him off at the office, so he's up sober and showered and in a fresh pressed suit. Maura- no, Nora's out, and Cora's working somewhere else in the house. So he's on the phone in a cavernous rec room - pool table and two TVs and a full bar, just across the hall from the home </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>theater - waiting for someone from Sauer's office to pick up.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Someone does, quickly. “Yeah, hello-“ It’s Sauer herself. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ's initial routine is just to head downstairs, out the back of her house across the alley and to the office. One of those small commercial buildings which used to be a Pizza Hut before it was a Kinko's before it was a Papa John's. There's a couple of ghouls and less-haemologically-empowered employees there doing correspondence, taking reports from people in the field. Such as they are, such as it is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There’s a knock on the basement door. It’s the signal, as it’s been the past few months since he’s been living there, that Soria has left a pile of freshly laundered clothes for him in a wicker basket on the steps past the door. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Presbyter Sauer," comes Wilson's voice, slightly crackly through the telephone. "It's Wilson. Is this a bad time?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Thanks." <span class='c6'>This is interesting. Tess Okienka was a bit less.. vivacious than the rest of Jessie's circle, but she did appreciate films.. KJ will dictate a reply, because this is the 1920s or something and that's how you do it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy stumbles out the door to catch the departing Soria. </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He picks her up outside her apartment -- a cozy place down the street from the surf shop, up on the third floor. There aren't that many buildings with more than three stories in Laguna. He parks on the curb and gets out, texting her that he's outside, and just leans back against his Lexus and appreciates the gathering night.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The priest turns. “Huh? Oh. Don’t worry about it, Thomas. Just one more chore.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer: “Just a busy one. What can I help you with?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Soria: “How did the ballet go?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>[Entertainment would be heck of welcome, Baron Modjeska.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He smiles when she steps out the door onto the sidewalk, short blonde hair swept back and still a bit wet from...the shower?

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "He's going to try to do some legal bull-shit to buy us some time to find Sp- Souza."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> "Hi," <span class='c4'>says Kayleigh Swanson, smiling back, walking towards him.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He glances back down at the basket. </span>"Really though, you don't gotta- look, as soon as I get some money I'll cover my own costs."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He straightens up off the car.</span> "You look--" <span class='c4'>She cuts him off with a kiss. She knows. And honestly, Cav's compliments don't have the most variety to them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He opens the passenger-side door for her, walks around to get back behind the wheel, and they're off into the night.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Anyway. It's a good thing most of the manorial duties are handled because this next part of the job KJ has to do personally. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She jaunts(? it sounded better when dictating) back across the street, locks the door, connects to the secure room through various VPNs and starts messing with Metasploit.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Instead of music, Kayleigh turns the Lexus's radio -- well, the satellite radio device that Cav's installed -- to KLAA, the radio affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Who're they playing?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Soria shrugs. “It’s my duty to look after you any way I can. If that’s washing your clothes for now, then that’s what it is. What’s next for you, then?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Kay:</span> "Fucking Rangers, man."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"I've been thinking about our meeting last week, and I want to talk about the kind of support I can offer the church at its crossroads. Can we set up a meeting?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "They winning?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer takes a moment to respond. “Let me check my calendar.” He can hear her moving papers around, and muffled talking in the background. Eventually: “I’m a bit pressed for time in the immediate future, Baron, but if it doesn’t inconvenience you, I’m at Presbyter Vincent’s office doing some work. I can meet you here.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Kay:</span> "The Angels?" <span class='c4'>She laughs.</span> "Nah, they're down 2-1. It's Hamels against Richards tonight, so you know. Ace against ace. It's only the fifth inning, so they could come back."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Aha! </span>"Presbyter Vincent? Down in Orange County? That's perfect. You have the address for me?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Well," <span class='c14'>he sighs. </span>"Cav's busy tonight so the Sponger issue's tabled till tomorrow. You got any... functions you're leading tonight? Y'know, for the Church."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She gives it. “Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. I’ll be at this number.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Now, Richards, he had the great year last year, right? Is he really the ace now?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Kay sighs.</span> "Well, it's either him or Weaver, right? And don't get me wrong, Weaver's great, but. You know. He's getting a little old, maybe."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Soria: “I’m meeting with Deacon Garra. The new housing. Some details he wants me to oversee. Thomas, if I can give you some advice? A lead that I remembered, for Souza.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Yeah?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Kay:</span> "Look at you, though. Remembering shit about baseball."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav grins and shrugs.</span> "Well, you know. I try." <span class='c4'>He also checked the roster on his phone while he was waiting for her.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Thank you very much. I'll be there within the hour, hopefully." <span class='c10'>Next he calls Cora.

I'm going to see some church ladies."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>They spend the rest of the ride listening to the game and talking baseball (to the best of Cav's ability), and then how her day was (busy, kinda crappy) and how her school's going (undergrad, a couple years late, still a part-time student).</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Cora: </span>"Really?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Yes. What?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Cora: </span>"Nothing."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Soria: “After his home was destroyed, he lived with a cousin in the area. A chef, last name Perez, a restaurant called Trattoria Impresario. He mentioned it a few weeks ago.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Then they talk about how </span><span class='i c4'>his</span><span class='c4'> school is going. Since Cav's been inducted into the Ordo, his appetite for reading and study found new life -- he's even started adding a library in one of the empty, large rooms in the north wing. And while he didn't technically need a cover story for doing so, he figured he might have one anyway by continuing to pursue something he'd put on hold when </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>he moved out here: a law degree.</span></p>

Unless he's literally using an ancient version of Android, that's not going to do much without an OS version plugged in, but it almost works.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It'd almost give KJ some sympathy for the illiterates and displaced professions, but, get this: she's doing it while also running a vampire barony.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "--So right now, I'm sort of looking at my options. Maybe USC Law? Maybe Stanford, but I don't think they do correspondence or online classes."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy whips out his phone and pulls up a map, begins tapping with his thumbs. </span>"How far away are we talking? -Hold on, got it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>So. Who's the best gossip she knows?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Kayleigh's encouraging and attentive, but doesn't press too much about the scheduling. There are some unspoken rules for what they do and don't talk about.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Soon, they've arrived. To Cav's relief, he did, in fact, remember to get the reservations like his notes said.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The offices of Presbyter Vincent are a shabby apartment next to a junior college and an upscale shopping mall.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Where's the restaurant at?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>It does, so Wilson will tell Cora to take the car and ride around and he'll call her when the meeting's over. How's the weather tonight?</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "I will, father. Take care."</p>

She can see the Baroness sitting on the porch, wrapped in a shawl, sitting next to a man in his 20s. “Just park in the driveway,” she calls. When the engine cuts out, the only sound is that of crickets. It’s colder out here. The smells and sounds are different. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson blinks. </span>"Presbyter Vincent, hello. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Now my understanding is that this is being resolved by the Judex. Obviously Lord Bren is the aggrieved party, and since the incident was in Baron Cavanaugh's territory I'm sure you've got his attention too. But do you have a formal advocate from the covenant yourselves? Who's representing the Parish?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will return at 2 AM, having left Kay dozing in their bed -- something else she's gotten used to.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He'll park a couple streets away and walk the rest on foot. He should be able to feel Tommy approaching, if he's not already there.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy's slouching in a nearby alley, grumbling.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Too late now. KJ rolls up the window - in case of birds - and steps out, away from the little pinging noises the car makes in the cold. She ended up with a thinner dress, something that would be a bad idea out here if body temperature was still a thing. </span>"Hey, Baroness. Mr. Aguilar, maybe Lord. Lord Secretary?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I'm never <span class='u '>totally</span> sure if we're going full Pride and Prejudice."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>At 2AM, Tommy slides out of the alley, tosses off his cigarette, and heads over to the Trattoria.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle: “If this becomes something the Episcopate has to go to court for? Presbyter Morse. We can always ask he be replaced by an alternative, though. Then it would be Tracey Greene.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav finds him pretty quickly -- that Obfuscate Tommy's using is good; Cav can only tell there's another Kindred in the area, can't really pinpoint him -- but he's also met Tommy before, so. It's pretty obvious, then, who it is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav meets him a block or so away from the restaurant.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>It isn't clear who sees who first. Tommy is in his hoodie, earbuds in. His phone is in his hand, and the song it's playing is Extreme Ways.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He blocks this out in the air with hand gestures. </span>"What you meant to say was, 'Sorry for being a huge fuckin' asshole, Welcome to Laguna.'"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav stands there, staring at him a moment. Is this guy for real?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The nosferatu doesn't smile either.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle considers him a moment. “Why the sudden interest in a distant parish’s legal representation, Baron?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It's kind of funny to meet and hear Santiago alongside Teresa, who's so gently formal she could live off it. Or does, maybe. Otherwise they seem well suited - both self sufficient, both kind of hot. Living out in the middle of nowhere, though. Is that romantic or just inconvenient?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav's hands ripple into hideous claws.

The road has turned into a miniature stream - they can barely see the shape of the Land Rover parked a few yards away from the front steps, and its tires are submerged a few inches in running water. The little rise in the land that the house sits on means that they’re dry, for now. Well, as dry as one can get in a pouring storm. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Bad night to be making housecalls in the valley.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Beneath them, in the mud a few steps from the front stairs of the grand, ruined house, the man with the ruined wood mask gives a shudder, and is still. His last words were faint, and hadn’t changed from his repeated prayer. Blood pools under him, visible even through the mud and water. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ crosses her arms, staring skeptically at the collapsing witch before her and Baron Laguna. Does the man think he can get away with babbling portentous crimes and then take the easy way out?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>What's wrong with him, and how much forcibly administered vitae would it take to fix it?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav, meanwhile, has walked to the very edge of wherever will keep him out of the rain to scan what's left of the treeline. See if there's anymore of them out there. God knows it'll be hard to hear them in this rain.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He seems to be bleeding from a terrible, tearing wound from under his arm down to his pelvis on the side of his body. Whatever ruined him had enough force behind it that it didn’t cut cleanly, or at least crushed and clawed as much as it severed. Blood runs in a dark red stream into the ground. Who knows how much he needs, or if it would help? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>So is he slipping into torpor at the moment?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>(If nothing is done)</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> All of this remains unknown to the man on his hands and knees in the small, hidden tunnel under the floorboards. Wilson seems to be…somewhere. He was just ahead of Tommy when they got to the X intersection, one path leading to each upstairs room, and one vertical passageway leading down, into darkness…</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Deacon Saldana: </span>"Jesus Christ."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He tries to turn around, wedges himself into a fetal position, has a small panic attack.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He’ll be either in torpor or completely dead in a few minutes, at the rate he’s losing vitae. His Beast, faint and sluggish, confirms what should have been an easy guess, regarding his nature. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy peers down the vertical passageway. Are there, like, hand-grips, or ladder rungs? Is it just a vertical shaft with smooth walls...?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As Cav looks into the rain, he can see something….part the rain, with its size. It’s a few dozen yards out, past the Land Rover, in the trees beyond the house’s clearing. It moves smoothly, back and forth, its great black bulk pacing to and fro, shaking the trunks of the trees it passes as it brushes them. It must be the source of the great piercing howl they heard. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ’s senses are a bit finer in the moment. She can hear it, place it, tell it’s not coming closer for now. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There’s a little metal ladder bolted into the hard clay soil of the shaft. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Something out there."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Yep. Let's get this guy inside."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She's going to shoulder the man, and press a wrist to his mouth to see if he's capable of taking advantage. It hurts. But this is an opportunity.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy grips the metal poles on each side of the first rung and heaves himself into the shaft, letting his weight carry him sliding down the ladder.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will have already signaled for his cats to pull back. Looks like they won't be going back out the front, at least not for awhile.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He counts as he drops, hoping to get some measure of distance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "How dead is he?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The man’s fangs reflexively sink into KJ’s wrist, and he drinks her stolen blood. She can feel the blood run through her arm into him…and pass out a few moments later. Enough stays in him so that he seems to come around, but the mindless stitching and repairing that should be taking place, isn’t. Something appears to be preventing the blood from clotting properly. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Tommy lands on something half metal, and half soft. Then he realizes he’s standing on Wilson, at the bottom of a large hole some thirty feet down. The Nosferatu is slumped over at the bottom of the ladder, eyes closed. It’s pitch dark down here. Can Tommy see in the dark? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Shots and Honey are going to take up positions lurking on the second floor, well-sheltered and able to flee if things go bad, but also poised to drop down and...well, let's be honest. If that's a werewolf out there, they're not going to be able to do much.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>And if it's not a werewolf, then things are even worse.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>In a moment, he can.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Oof. Aw shit, Wilson? Wilson, man-" <span class='c14'>Tommy grabs the nosferatu by the lapels and shakes, to no effect.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav considers drawing his Glock, but figures it would just make him look stupid. No pistol's going to best what's out there.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ staggers slightly as she sets the acolyte down on the stairs. If the cats want to eat him they're welcome, she guesses. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The chamber is roughly circular, hewn out by hand and instrument. The walls are lined with bookshelves - some bare, some splintered so badly they’re really more heaps of broken wood, some holding moldering and torn volumes. There’s a desk on the opposite side of the chamber, an overturned wooden chair in front of it. The desk is covered with papers and miscellany like pens, magnifying glasses, and an ancient-looking calculator. There’s </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> lamps of some kind on brackets around the room, but they’re unlit. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "He's been poisoned or enspelled, maybe wolf-bitten.. not actually dead. Not recovering any time soon."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Which stairs? The front stairs are barely out of the elements…and the ones in the front grand room are behind the front doors, now closed. At least the lights are on downstairs, now. They can hear music coming from the house. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "If he's not verbal, he can't help us; if he can't help us, he's not a priority. If that's not a werewolf out there in it's final fuck-you form, then it's Jubal with a brand new Halloween costume."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy curses. No Sponger here, either. And what's wrong with Wilson?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "What do I need to know about Jubal?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>If it's werewolves, either they lose interest or we're dead anyway.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He seems to be unconscious. No visible wounds or injuries. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ was referring to the inner stairs, where Honey and Shots are guarding.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy rises from a crouch and puts his hands on his hips, sighing. He nudges the insensate Wilson with his shoe. </span>"Fuck."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Hierophant, and as personally potent as you'd expect him to be given that rank. His Cruac is on point -- 'killed a friend of mine with an acorn' good. He seems particularly fond of transmutation -- changing the form of flesh with the power of the blood. I think that's a school of Cruac, at least."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Ehhh. Okay, so it sounds like our best shot would be to attack on sight? The rituals take time."</p>

Good news is, we used this flashlight" <span class='c4'>Cav produces it.</span> "to set him on fire. He does not like its beam at all. Bad news is now he knows about that, and if it's him, he'll have made preparations to counter it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The rituals do take time, presuming they weren't already in the hopper before we got here."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He peeks out the window.</span> "Now if it's not Jubal, the game's a lot simpler. It's a werewolf. Claws, jaws, and rage. It'll tear us apart."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Oh. Then they’ll have one more thing to look at as they come in through the front doors. As they enter, the, uh….hmm. The formerly ruined front room seems to be entirely repaired. Decorated, even, as for a party. The wooden floors are no longer warped by water, the paint isn’t peeling, the ceiling is in one piece. The lighting is soft and golden. The inside of the house feels pleasantly warm compared to the chill outside. Coat racks in </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> the foyer are full with mink and fine satin. They can hear laughter coming softly from beyond, in the main hall. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The music they heard earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CERvQW0iSDQ</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Hee indicates the other dead cultist -- the one that was already there.</span> "That man was beaten to death."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "A vampire. Beaten to death. Blunt force trauma, through torpor and out the other side."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The dead cultist is still there, though. It’s a bit of an incongruity with the now pleasant room. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Then maybe we should try and get into the panic room- what?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Usually a werewolf uses claws, but that's the sort of strength and anger you're de--"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "This is what he saw!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ cups her hands and yells into the impossible mansion: </span>"Wilson! Where's Baron Hollywood?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav snaps out of it after a second and begins looking around specifically at the decorations -- he's looking for any sign that this is, indeed, Thomas Franks's restored foyer, rather than some other room entirely.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy drags Wilson away from the base of the ladder and lays him out on the dusty floor, cursing under his breath. He briefly considers going through the man's pockets, but instead turns over the wooden chair from the study and lights up a cigarette.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He checks his watch after a fashion, sniffs, and rubs out his cigarette on the floor and proceeds back up the ladder.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It matches the dimensions of the foyer they saw before…it’s just been changed. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It has to be.. memory, triggered by something. Cruac? But there's only one of them who could have brought it here, the image of a restored mansion. KJ heads up to the landing, looking for Tommy and Wilson.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Good luck, dude," <span class='c14'>he shouts back down into the darkness at the unconscious nosferatu.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav follows. Give him a landmark: a notable vase, a weird painting, a distinguished chair. Anything that stands out in the room. Doesn't matter what.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Whether any of the mess in the chamber has been left by Sponger, Tommy can’t tell. His rummaging doesn’t come up with anything particularly useful - the desk’s drawers are locked, and he doesn’t have the key. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy curses all the way back out the tunnel and emerges coughing covered in fine particles of dust and lint.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ and Cav come into the main hall, leading up to the 2nd floor landing. The house here is just as well-lit. Bunting hangs from railings and paper ribbons dangle from the ceiling. Punch bowls and silver serving trays stand on tables set on the side of the rooms. Around them, indistinct shadows the size of people laugh and murmur indistinctly, gathered in small groups as they would be at a party. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Punch bowl! That'll do.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Baron Anaheim." <span class='c4'>He points at the punch bowl.</span> "There's a punch bowl sitting right there, well-polished and apparently half-full. Do you see it?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"No, I think it. Our minds are being affected - this is someone else's idea overload onto our sense. I think it's the memory of a party Franks once threw."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Specifically, I think it's- Saldana! Where's Frost?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "He's out cold in the tunnel. I have no idea what happened."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cav noticed a portrait hung over the staircase leading to the 2nd floor. The wind and rain had ruined it, but now he can see it in its restored former form. http://i.imgur.com/ajKmbpY.jpg</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Also hello, what the fuck's going on here."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As Tommy comes out of the passageway, he can see the same restoration has been applied to the upstairs. The bookshelves in the study have been stood upright, their shelves re-ordered…but any closer examination reveals the titles on the spines remain undistinct and hazy. The shadows are chatting here, too…but he can only hear snatches and fragments, words swimming into intelligbleness for a few moments before drifting away again. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Yeah, but they're also usually constrained to one aesthetic. Fancy dinner parties don't quite fit it."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The inside of the bedroom looks like it’s just been bought and furnished. The bed is made with fine linens and silk pillows. The small bookshelf and night-stand are decorated with green glass lamps, the walls with paintings of distant landscapes and nature scenes. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Inside, a man is standing next to the bed. His long, handsome face has been permanently scarred with some disfigurement, although a full beard hides some of it. Next to him, a woman with dark brown hair in a red dress is listening to him speak. On the bed, another woman with long blonde hair put up in rings and coils sits on the bed and listens as well. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Who the fuck are <span class='b '>you</span> people!?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Tommy can hear a quiet moan from somewhere in the room. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Do I know you, asshole?" <span class='c14'>Tommy looks for the source of the moan.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger is on his side, in a corner. Tommy gets the feeling that if he moves over to him, whatever else in the room will stop. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Dude, Sp- Souza, are you okay?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I did, once.” The man returns to his conversation. It’s hard to tell, with words falling in and out of audible range seemingly at random. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy pushes past people and grabs Sponger by the arm.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger looks up. His red and blue checkered bandana has been torn. His eyes struggle to focus, and Tommy can see the blood around his form. The room is empty except for him and the other Nosferatu. There’s not much in here except for some wrecked furniture. The metal lock of the door has a bloody handprint on it, with some blood leading down to Sponger. He must have closed it and immediately fallen over. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As Cav settles in with the journal, he can read the two entries he deciphered previously. The rest, as he quickly remembers, remains hidden, encoded with an undecipherable one-time-pad code. Unfortunately, you’d need the code itself to get past the encryption.

After an hour, he's given up on his phone and has written the poem out on one of his legal pads -- multiple times, in fact, until he's almost got it memorized.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> This is…jumbled. Actually, it’s complete nonsense.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Before she falls asleep, or dead, depending on who you ask, KJ gets an email back from her old contact in Minneapolis. “OTP key.

I'm sure our beauteous freehold will serve as ample inspiration for your arts, my lady." <span class='c12'>He pulls at the reins of his riding bird, causing it to shrug a shoulder and swerve off into a formation of sorts with the other knight. The two wheelin wide circles around you, and then </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>around a notional cylinder of air leading away. Before your eyes, a path of mallow-soft cloudstuff is traced through the sky, spiraling upwards towards the Daylit Court.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir hops aboard Errant. Her grin hasn't faded. If anything, it's got even more of an edge.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom, to Eikichi before they attack and do their cool intro: </span>"Ah! They have an Earth-Shaping Jewel! Anyone who's touched the jewel within the last day can work stone by hand as if it were clay, so long as the jewel itself isn't moved. Steal that, and the whole mine comes to a stop."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's very strange to ride Errant along the clouds - they're exactly as bouncy and elastic as they look, and there's a weird, resonating rubbery noise rather than the hooves-on-stone cadence Ir is used to. Still, it's plenty fast. In fact, it seems a bit faster than it should be, given the height of the clouds above the mountains, suggesting that someone's playing some kind of trick </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>with distances or velocities to speed the journey.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>So it's in what only feels like a few minutes that Ir finds herself touching down in a broad, idyllic-looking town square. There's market stalls all around and broad streets stretching in every cardinal direction. Wooden signs depicting stylized swords, gems, or potions hang from poles or awnings. To the east is a great castle, pearly-white, with an adjoining church or temple of some </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>kind. Elsewhere are great fields where birds graze, some sort of barracks, a monastery or dojo, a sorcerers' tower...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She's heading for the castle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Avalleur advises Ir to investigate the inn, or simply join in the commotion of the market square, but seems to be a busy knight; he's almost immediately back off on patrol. Ir and her shadow are surrounded now by... townsfolk? Young or old, they're all clear-skinned and pointy-eared.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "No, I think not."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Here's the thing about skalds, sir knight."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya will have to get away quickly - he can't stay a shadow for much longer, and popping out of Ir's shadow would draw some unwanted eyes. Is there somewhere nearby he can stop being a shadow and start being a thief?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Oh, yeah, that's easy. At midday the town market is crowded indeed, and Tatsuya's got endless opportunities to simply slip off into the crowd or down some alley or another.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "We're wise in the old ways of the world. And like you, we have our traditions we must abide. You think I didn't know when I walked up those dreamclouds, that once I did, I couldn't leave? I knew. I did it because I don't want to leave...until you all are forced to let me."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Down in the mortal world, Blossom and Eikichi crest a cliff of jagged rock and sail straight through the air and line of sight of a small cabal of scandalized sorcerers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "You go up to that castle, sir knight. You tell that pretty princess the world of man has a challenge for her subjects. And then you tell her to find the best musician amongst you, and meet me at the crossroads."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Unless you're yellow."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He'll slip away, then, and keep an eye on Ir from, well, a different set of shadows. All eyes ought to be on her, anyhow, so staying hidden shouldn't be that difficult.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>...There better be some crossroads up here.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>This looks less like a mine than a firing range. There's a staging area of sorts on a wide plateau around which are rough cabins, supply stockpiles, and paths and railways leading further down the mountain. The center of the plateau's a wide circle carved into the very stone and decorated with occult symbols and inlaid gemstones of arcane significance. Before the circle is a mine </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>entrance itself, but it's almost perfectly circular and much wider than could possibly have been practical to dig by hand. There are wooden logs and beams set into the stone presumably just in case, but the general impression is that someone's been blasting rather than digging their way down into the mountain.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi's eyes and brow burn golden, and his hair flutters in the wind to match. In his left hand he holds a hellish and hateful thing, while his right hand gently holds his chin as he smirks.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>This impression is supported by the fact that four men and women in heavy leather robes are currently standing at significant points in the graven circle, shaping magic. Besides them, there's some of those hulking elementals, a contingent of guards in cathak colors, some miners whose chief pursuit seems to be hauling out the rubble that this sorcery leaves in its wake, and a </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>dragon-blooded man with a sword and shield who's just stepped out of one of the cabins. You can tell because of the corona of flames around his head and shoulders.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Cathak something-or-other, Blossom doesn't recognize him: </span>"What-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir finds that there are definitely crossroads up here. Hell, the market square is essentially the biggest crossroads in the freehold. If she's heading up to the castle, no one stops her... until she reaches its actual doors, that is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She'll head to the crossroads first, but if no one shows up to meet her -- or if the knight just acts aggrieved and confused rather than relaying the message -- then she'll head up to the castle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The walk feels shorter than it actually is, especially when Ir looks behind herself - separating the castle from the main market square is plenty of rolling emerald hillside and one long cobblestone bridge arcing from one cloud to another. The castle itself is tall, white, immaculately clean, and surrounded by a moat of sparkling blue water that nevertheless contains a few huge green </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>lizards that sort of lazily splash around. Right beside the castle, actually connected to it by a long, thin bridge of marble, is what must be the local church of Balor. It's an imposing structure of mostly upwards-pointing triangles whose stained glass windows are generally decked out in hues of red, orange, and purple and feature a lot of eye and sun iconography.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's hard to tell, incidentally, who up here is actually human. All the townsfolk seem to have things to do, even if those things are milling around and waiting to be spoken to.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>But like I was saying Ir, Ir isn't stopped until she reaches the castle doors. There, a pair of skinny, mustachioed guards with pointy helmets that dramatically cross their halberds before her just as she approaches the castle's main entrance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's task-oriented. Indulging this fantasy world will only strengthen it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The guards are silent, and almost mechanical - when Ir steps back, their halberds uncross, but when she steps forward they cross again, and the farther forward she moves the more it feels like she's walking through molasses or pressing up against a physical wall. The implication is that she has to earn access to the castle by some means.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Oh for the love of.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Are there any other ways in?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Probably...? It might involve scaling the wall or swimming the moat or finding and sneaking in through some kind of servant's entrance. Tatsuya would have to do some scouting.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Meanwhile, Eikichi and Blossom are almost certainly joining battle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, Ir seems safe for now. There's probably time to do a little scouting, right?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>These 'guards' probably aren't even people, properly speaking. She'll wander back to the town square and poke her head in the inn. Is anyone else around here playing music?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Eikichi and his pain in the ass plans.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya will try seeking out a servant's entrance first - scaling the wall is appealing, but perhaps too flashy, and swimming is awful in the best of circumstances. He'll keep an ear out to hear if things go poorly with Ir, but come on, breaking into a castle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eikichi and Blossom have crested a ridge such that they're right above a contingent of soldiers guarding the sorcerers at work. The sorcerers themselves appear to be mortals initiatied into the arts, and they're totally consumed with their magic - together, they're constantly gesturing and chanting to keep control and direction of a great auger of nearly-invisible earth essence that's </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>lancing forward into the mine entrance and, presumably, extending downward into the mountains. Eikichi suspects that some complicated infrastructure involving mirrors and geomantic carvings is allowing the spell to thread its way far deeper than its casters could normally reach or see on their own.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Right now, both Solars are hovering within a whirlwind, out of reach of the soldiers and elementals both. That's probably why the Cathak guardsmen are drawing bows.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir find a lot to potentially do at the town square. There's actually a little performer's stage, currently occupied by a band playing a catchy but repetitive tune that seems to be setting the tempo of all the other activities going on in the market square. There's a bar with room for a performer, plenty of spots she could just set up along the road to start busking... 'skald' is a </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>biiit foreign to the daylit court, but 'bard' is definitely not.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Meanwhile, Tatsuya's at liberty to try to find a way into the castle that doesn't involve playing along - or, at least, involves playing along with a different set of players. Step one, case the place.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She'll go busking, then. She's got a mistrust of these institutions. Doesn't want to be pressured into signing any contracts.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi holds his arms akimbo as if to sweep all the sorcerers into a big hug. </span>"Do not despair, my friends! We come to dismantle the old order, not its prisoners. Imagine a world where we can practice our art without ostracism, a world where we needn't peddle our knowledge to soldiers and armies to prosper! In a more righteous world there is <span class='i '>so much</span> we can achieve together."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The thief finds a number of avenues. First, there </span><span class='u c12'>is</span><span class='c12'> some kind of submerged tunnel at the bottom of the moat, but using it would probably be uncomfortable for a number of reasons - holding your breath, cold water, all the giant alligators... beyond that, there's also a hedge maze of sorts on the opposite end of the castle from the main doors, so if you can get across the moat by </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>some means </span><span class='u c12'>and</span><span class='c12'> navigate a complicated but ultimately solveable pattern of guard patrols you'll be able to just slip inside a back entrance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir runs through the classics on Iscariot as a six-string: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95WeNwF5448 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VydnNO2A0k4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_NHr4lvqc and so on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "This is the promise of the Unconquered Sun. It is the promise we stand and deliver. It is the promise of a better day."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Come! What say you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Finally, there's the church. It looks open to the public, and it's connected to the castle by a bridge, so if you can go in there and then lose whoever keeps an eye on visitors to stop them from just wandering off into the side halls you could probably climb to the main tower/steeple thing and then take the bridge across.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eikichi speaks, and the four sorcerers share glances over the roiling tangle of earth essence they're carefully manipulating. To the layman, it doesn't appear they do anything further.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The two solars know different, though, because they've got arcane training. They can see that two of the mages, both women, subtly unhook their hand gestures from the magic that's going on, ceasing their upkeep of the spell. A third, a man, is sweating - he keeps glancing up at the Stormwind Rider, clearly tempted, but ultimately grits his teeth and holds on. The fourth, another </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>woman, twists her face into a mask of fury and doesn't let up for a moment.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>To the last, Eikichi says softly, </span>"So be it." <span class='c10'>and begins to crush her will.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well. If they're going to make it that simple, they deserve this.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir's skill is recognized almost immediately. It's not half an hour before a small crowd of elfin villagers and townsfolk is surrounding her play area and tapping their feet, dancing with each other, singing along, cheering her on... it's hard to tell which of these are basically constructs or hobgoblins and which are abducted people, but at least one listener must be a full-blown </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>raksha; she's a short-haired woman in a long furred coat who's demanded that her servants stop her carriage by the side of the road so that she can get a better listen.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya runs across the water and into the hedge maze. Crap moat you've got there.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir ignores the rakhsa and goes about her set. She ignores the townsfolk too, for the most part; she's absorbed in her art.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>And she's letting the marks come to her.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's when Ir is between sets that a long-faced majordomo whose pointed ears and nose droop dramatically and eyes always seem to be closed approaches her. His lady has a proposition, he says; she'll be attending the court this very night, and her retinue is in need of a good musician if she's to impress.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>And, once he's snuck through the hedge maze, it's a crap maze they have there too. He slips inside the castle without looking back.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir accepts, but is careful to decline any compensation or offer of further employment.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>A hail of poorly-aimed boulders goes sailing past Eikichi and Blossom, missing by a damn mile. Following those boulders is what might be a full-on meteor, though; the sword-wielding Cathak dynast is blazing with flame as he takes a prodigious leap up the side of the very cliff that Eikichi and Blossom came drifting down from!</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>That was actually pretty had, Tatsuya finds, but not for the reasons infiltrations usually are. It's not that the guards were particualrly clever or observant, or the sight lines really punishing - there was just so </span><span class='u c12'>much</span><span class='c12'> ground to cover, so many strictly consistent patterns of patrol to memorize and thread between. Still, he's done it - he's inside the castle itself, free to poke </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>around. What's Tatsuya want to do - rob the treasury, assassinate the king, graze off the kitchens...?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Pretty hard*</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>That's good practice on Ir's part, but largely unnecessary; any oaths sworn or agreements shaken on are really only going to be binding for the fae, especially given that the Dawn caste is proof against the Wyld's insidious influence.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Either way, though, her entrance to the castle is secured - although she'll probably have to wait for the evening to make it. The raksha noble Ir'll be playing for is named Rajiezna, and seems to be some kind of business mogul - she's got her hand in a wide variety of the item and potion and weapon and so on shops arrayed around the central square. Actually, she'd be delighted if Ir </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>could play around there for a while, or at least teach the noble's own bards a few good tunes, but it won't be a dealbreaker if Ir refuses.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>That aside, Ir's got some time to pass, which she could conceivably use on shopping or fine dining or just exploration of the rest of the freehold.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir will indulge the raksha that much, as it'll get her more face time with the people she's supposed to be saving.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, Tatsuya meant to open a door for Ir, but she seems to have that covered.

Of the three remaining, two sit in a church basement, one watching the other lay on a bunk and stare at the ceiling while he enjoys being under house arrest. The other is free to do whatever he likes, in a city famous for its thousand ways of entertaining the rich and leisured. The only problem is that he’s stopped liking all of them. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The two busybodies, though, wake up with things to do. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Clinton Cavanaugh is going to court. And that probably means going to Court.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>First, though, he'll shower, dress, feed the girls, feed himself from the supply in the blood fridge, and call the office to make sure there's nothing new that demands his attention. There probably isn't -- unless he has any text messages from Bryan or Brian -- but it's a good ritual and lets Buchanan and Rush know he's awake and ready for work.</span></p>

He keeps it locked, partly so the expensive climate control system isn't working overtime. It's cool and dry, with tiled floors.

The weapons, in particular, are on sturdy </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances is dressed in a sensible black, er, dress. “Oh, uh,” she says, looking around. “I’m sure people will start to show up soon.” She brightens. “But you’re here!

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The great Lancaster estate looms vertically out of the flat, cold sand and dirt of the desert and scrublands of the lands beyond the mountains. The cold white light of fluorescents illuminate the front entrance, with its pillars and hedges. Three servants will be waiting by the door, one to attend to his Hollywood counterparts, one to take anything heavy off of Wilson’s hands, and the other to greet him effusively. “Baron Hollywood. It is </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> an honor, sir, as always. The Countess awaits you inside.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He fans his hands. </span>"Then, Boom, next thing you know you're cutting fucking throats with the best of them."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger: “I mean….you’re kind of abandoning yourself. Inhabiting a role. Giving up your duty to be yourself, when you can just wear a mask.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger: “Then you’re responsible for changing.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He makes a pained grunt.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson walks like he's encumbered, but then doesn't he always? The servant can take his coat and then Wilson goes inside.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav sets the phone aside after his last text for a good hour or two. It's time to work -- very, very methodically, while writing everything down.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances looks around the interior of the beautifully renovated nightclub for an answer. “Um…there’s a few people in the corner…that’s pretty much it. You’re welcome to them…” There are, it seems, about half a dozen people nervously trying to make conversation with each other, a bartender with nothing to do, and two figures talking to each other in a back circular booth. The nightclub really is beautiful, though! Soft golden </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> light, with just a hint of smoky darkness, walls tiled with a soft ceramic look, fountains and white linen hangings completing the look of some relaxed public bath. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Blythe Sulzberger, Countess Lancaster, descends down the grand staircase to meet him. She’s wearing the same outfit she wore to the opera, minus the hat. “Wilson. I hope your trip here was uneventful.” All around, landscape paintings showing the poppy fields in full summer bloom light up the room with oranges and reds. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances looks certain. “Yes, of course! I put advertisements in all the major newspapers. Even the Pennysaver.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "But my job is sorta ill-defined. I have the run of the Parish, but no real paper obligations."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "You been here longer than I have."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"I don't know if anybody.. reads newspapers? Like of course they did, fifty years ago."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "So I guess I'm asking for... advice?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"The club scene is like.. this is not my area of expertise and APPARENTLY it is yours, actually, but, I was thinking torn ads for popular local bands plastered on every street corner and public toilet?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances: “I’m not an idiot, KJ. I did the whole online thing, too. Myspace. Craigslist. All the big ones.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "It's possible somebody is hexing you and hexing your club."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Honestly, if you need to hunt them down and kill them I'm in."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cav’s transcriptions require effort and attention, but with the code, he makes constant progress. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He takes a short break, during which he wonders if he shouldn't set up a ceiling-mounted webcam pointing down at the table, so he can have recordings of the entire process.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> They seem to be…a collection of different things, actually. Short quotations from larger works, interspersed with diary-like entries, starting from 1972 and heading back in time. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Not only would that help with the whole memory thing, but his new 'colleagues' might find it interesting as well. Or maybe not. Who knows.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> So things like “You can tell the state of dispassion has been reached when the spiritual intellect starts to catch glimpses of its own inner radiance, when it can remain in a state of tranquility even when troubled by dream images, and when it can look on all of life’s affairs with equanimity,” are mixed in with mundane reports of politicking in the Orange Court, describing the petty feuds of different nobles Cav has either never heard o</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> or whose names are disguised with simple assigned letters. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's wearing a light suit of pale brown linen, the sort of thing you might wear if you were going to look at a garden outdoors in summer. </span>"Blythe! You look lovely. I brought you something." <span class='c10'>He presents the halberd to her with a flourish as from midair.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He puts his palms up at Sponger. </span>"I mean, like. You beat the shit outta Cosmo Morgan, one of the worst ratfuckers out there. So you're at least doing something right."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He wonders briefly if this stuff might be dangerous to even read. Cav remembers that Rollie's condition spread memetically. At least after a fashion.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances looks less certain as she does her best to dance. It looks like she hasn’t learned any moves since the midcentury. “Well…we’re technically in Donald Bren’s territory. I just bought the feeding rights to the club itself. So you probably…shouldn’t.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster examines it with interest. “Oh, this really is genuine.” She looks at the armorer’s stamp. “You shouldn’t have. I only wanted to catch up with you.” She looks around. “I’ll have one of the paintings wrapped for you. Take it home with you.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger shakes his head. “I don’t think awaiting a death sentence in a basement is because I did something right. By anyone’s law.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He scoffs. </span>"You aren't gonna die, Souza."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Cav seems pretty sure we can throw this out."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Here’s something interesting, if mildly alarming. The diary mentions repeated visits to…”the forests, beyond the lights.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ah, more dark forests. Baron Anaheim will be pleased.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"OK no I definitely shouldn't. Honestly, the club is beautiful and I don't know why people haven't caught on yet." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "There's a kind of greco-roman vibe, which might not be what the kids are into these days? My only real idea is, get in a band, something with lyrics you could misrepresent as 'let's all get drunk and make out'."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"You're too kind. How've you been, Blythe?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sponger: “One Invictus noble tempts me into this situation, the other promises to get me out. I’d rather have avoided them altogether.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Someday she's got to actually find out how old Frances is. Somenight.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ's actually torn between probing into what the heck Frances is doing with a club and.. taking advantage of the fact she's got one. Just a few people here makes it dangerous.. but that's fine.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> One of the figures in the back booth has tilted the massive oak table up so it’s sloping. “See, no gum. I told you it was brand new. Yuan wouldn’t buy used, god-“ “Don’t, you’re gonna push it over,” “No, look, I can hold it. Golf is a workout, right? Technically I’ve been working out.” “You ride around in the cart.” “Hey, look at the grain on the underside-“ “Jesse, you’re gonna get us thrown out-“ The table</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> crashes on its side with a bang. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Anyway, Cav will carefully transcribe all the information to his phone, which he's got linked to the office's CMS remotely -- he publishes the text, and then careful photographs of the pages and the cipher itself to a secured folder in the cloud, then deletes the local copies.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “Busy. The Court has need of a strongman who’s less self-interested than my sire and with fewer strings attached than the Marquise. Of course,” she says, smiling, “I’m less sociable than either.”</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances ignores it. “So, um…are you impressed?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"What kind of work they got you doing?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “Keeping tabs on bits and bobs and figures of interest. Like you. I’m acquiring quite the stable of interesting associates.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “The rest, of course, I’m not at liberty to discuss. What’s the line? If I told you, I’d have to kill you,” she jokes. Wilson thinks. She’s not very good at it. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Not necessarily a dealbreaker."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She guides him out into the gardens, towards the greenhouses. “Maybe I’m picking up the attitude from my new rival in Palos Verdes. You know how that crowd is.” She pauses. “Well, maybe you don’t. Lucky you.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav has the rest of the night to himself, then. He'll get caught up on any paperwork he's neglected. Taxes, for one. The legal person he once was still has to pay them on his investments.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Thaaaat seems like something Frances might want to deal with? No? Well, you can't call her a control freak. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There’s a difference between translating and reading. Cav can get as far as a fifth into the diary before his cipher abruptly stops working, around 1971. Actually, this diary seems to jump around in time quite a bit. Maybe its sorted by theme rather than date? The last entry reads: </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Anyway, KJ </span><span class='b c6'>is</span><span class='c6'> impressed, just not.. pleased. She can channel that. </span>"It's way beyond what I'd expected. The ambition and effort it takes to move into this business is a big deal! They always say it's a close-knit thing- I guess you'll end up hanging out with other local nightlife types as things pick up, forming photo ID cartels or whatever."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "How are you doing on smoky backrooms and fizzy drinks and stuff?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Murray?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She's also keeping an eye on the, uh, 'crowd'. Are there any prospects there at all? Any frustrated young men, maybe ones wondering if they've walked into the wrong club.. or the cocky types who're playing at being big fish in a new and oddly well-lit pond?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Transcribed from the Temple of Pisha-Kunak-Ter, recovered 1941, fragments.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “...As he himself said, it is that very Kingdom that comes in power to those who have seen It.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That's auspicious.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Franks’s voice resumes after that. “I have entrusted the eldest of the three siblings with my notes and my updated codes, although even she only knows the locations of the latter, not their contents. I’m grateful for her…and I pity her. One sister mad, one brother bad, and she has to shepard her lonely little tribe through the place no light reaches, wondering if it would be easier to examine her heritage more closely…I must remember</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> to bring her a gift next time. Los Padres is not a place where luxuries are found, but it is a place where they are appreciated.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The rest of the entry ends with little of interest, just a few random notes and scribblings, impossible to make sense of without context. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances looks incredibly relieved and happy at securing KJ’s qualified approval. “Oh…I don’t have any smoky backrooms. Just…the dance floor. I mean, it was supposed to be louder in here…I mean, it will be, once more people show up. So you don’t have to worry about being overheard.” Some people have walked in, actually, the local Costa Mesa blend of people dressed up from their work in Irvine law firms and people dressed down </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Probably not incidental, to be honest.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> To All Associates & Partners,</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It is with solemnity and unhappiness that I must inform the firm that Cornelius van Vleick and Markus Holmgren, two of our Directors, have been officially designated as missing following the sinking of their transport to Europe in a sudden storm.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> operations, I am assigning my childe Alicia Holymount the interim title of Director. Your patience and hard work are appreciated more now than ever. Please direct any questions to….[etc]. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Oh shit.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The old bastard finally went and did it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He'll put down the phone, pace a bit, stare at it, then pick it up and text the contact in his phone as A. Holymount a single word:</span> &lt;Congratulations.&gt;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Then he'll turn the damn thing off for awhile.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"It can be hard to tell when unhappy people are taking solace in each other and when they're just making each other worse. Feeding off each other."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “I suppose you can approach it with discipline. Ruthlessly. ‘Are you making me happier?’ ‘Am I being my best self around you?’ Cut them out if the answer is no.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Doesn't really seem like a way to treat people, though, does it?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He'll take a walk, spend thirty minutes or so wandering the night streets of Laguna, before he turns his phone back on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “It depends on the people. Whether they’re really your friends, or whether you only know them because of circumstance and proximity. Allthough, they might do a version of the same to you regardless of how you treat them.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> In the chat app, Cav has a single response. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> &lt;Thank you.&gt; </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That's that, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He sees the chat bubble of a response being typed appear for a few seconds. It goes away, and doesn’t come back. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He sits down and sighs and stares out at the water.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>It's to be a coup, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “So, what now?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>All the others are jealous. It's her they watch and him she wants, he who's entitled by his hair and his suit and his words and his job. Her voice is the same as her body, amazing without being able to remember a damn thing about it. Everyone's still watching him and her both on the way out (No back rooms but there isn't a nightclub in existence without a back alley. Maybe he won't even wait to take her home. Pretty sure he can show her a thing or two right here. (She's got something to show him too. It's a stained knife, and what's one more-))</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"For who?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “You.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson shrugs. </span>"I guess you've still got me keeping tabs on Cavanaugh. Though honestly I think that's a little alarmist."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He stands and walks back towards the house. The first thing he needs to do is limit his liability. And that means being informed about what the hell the Shepherds want from Los Angeles. When did Kevin MacMahon leave the city?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ steps out of the smoky light of the half-empty club to the "club of barons'" table. Hopefully it's upright by now. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It isn’t, it’s got a crack down the middle and another has been dragged into its place while it rests stricken close by. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> About a month after Cav’s promotion to Baron. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well. Having the other one giving them a little privacy might be good; the way KJ looks right now, crossing the floor visibly would have attracted attention. Suffused with the blush of life, of course, but also literally blushing and very obviously satisfied. She's not radiating any actual vampire magic anymore, though!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “Is it? Murray wanted to assign a babysitter of her own. I figured I should push that we do the same.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>And Cav's sure he did, in fact, leave the city? They saw each other before he went and he said he was going? He didn't up and vanish one night, then send a text message or e-mail later apologizing for jetting off?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He stopped by a for a few minutes’ awkward conversation, in person. He didn’t elaborate on his reasons for leaving, though he hinted that Cav’s newfound favor with the court meant that the Shepards’ interests were obviously being well enough represented in Southern California. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well, that's good.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>A new director means an organizational reshuffle. He might not be alone out here for much longer.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances is listening to Jesse talk about some kind of reality show with rapt attention. Pearl is staring off at nothing in particular. “So then Marci wins the immunity challenge. But she’s still pissed off at James for kissing Kaytie a couple nights ago, right. So she makes him go to the house vote-“ </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Hollywood: </span>"If she was here I'd tell her she was being alarmist, too. Do you think he'd be worth keeping tabs on if Helena wasn't?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>What he needs to do is to start consolidating his friends in LA. Not an easy task, considering how they've all fled the city and left him here.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"These things are practically Mafia now. Gimme <span class='i '>Say Yes to the Dress</span> anyday."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>But maybe there's some promise to be found in these new barons.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “Well…I don’t really know his sire. Or hers. Don’t you think it’s a bit worrisome, involving these…outside people?” She stops, suddenly. “Can you keep a secret?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jesse: “What have you been up to, KJ? Still running errands for the Silent One?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>At the very least, this Baron Anaheim seems good at computers. Could be a useful contact to have if any of Peter's whizkid ghouls start poking around his network.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>In fact, up-armoring the barony network has gone to the top of the priority list. Especially given what he's got on their servers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Nah, that's ending. I've got to learn how to actually, like, look after a territory in a way which doesn't involve being at war. What did James see in Kaytie?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Sure."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jesse shrugs. “Who knows. It’s all edited, anyway. What’s this about a New Barons club?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “A little birdie told me that they’re not so outside as they’d like us to think.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"What for? They looking to expand?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Hollywood probably isn't interested or involved enough in Court politics to be compromised, either -- except by young women with similar-sounding names, Cav recalls; might want to make sure he's not one of </span><span class='i c4'>those</span><span class='c4'> Kindred before investing too heavily in any relationship there -- and that Carmelite cleric with the fucking dragonsbreath shotgun taped to his back would be good when this </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>whole thing blows up.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>And they're all still tied together by what happened at the Franks Estate. Where he saw a ghost of Alicia.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Too many coincidences.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Starting to get that creeping feeling again, the one Cav remembers so well from his time as deputy: everyone knows what's going on but you.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>This is.. good. Comfortable, feeling human-or-better.. amid Jesse's inane dramas and Pearl's companionable glowering and Frances' approval-seeking thing (always manages to succeed in the end, somehow).

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Do you think it's a good idea?

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Lancaster: “I think they meant that the Shepherds have been involved in things here for more than just a few months.

It's a motley of elfin humans (or humanoids) and plant-creatures all playing together on a collection of mostly woodwinds and stringed instruments, all watched over by a massive woman of sylvan aspect. She's dozing or daydreaming or something, only barely paying attention as they practice, but her </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>long, leafy hair cascades down and across the floor the musicians play on and there's a strong sense they're dependent on her somehow.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>kicked up by the floating Stormwind Rider.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir resolves to try and stay out his way, more than anything else. But that won't be possible if he's got powerful friends in the castle, and there's no </span><span class='i c4'>way</span><span class='c4'>a kid like that doesn't have powerful friends in the castle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The sorcerers are sort of eyeing each other and trying to figure out if they should be pulling daggers. The various landbound foes of Eikichi and Blossom aren't so conflicted, though - a hail of rocks and arrows come flying up at them!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>From within the shower of missiles comes one arrow that flies straight and true, as if Heaven itself smiles on the bowman. The Essence of air courteously withdraws, so as to offer no resistance- swifter than eagles it races toward the mark. Blossom doesn't notice any of this, and ducks her head to the side. The arrow hisses past her and shatters on a nearby rock.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Hmm. Tatsuya's not exactly in a position to strike openly, here, so he'll have to settle for gathering information. Is there any fiddler among the group that's distinguishing themselves right now?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Has it got to be a fiddler? The star of the show's got what'd be a fiddler in a human's hands, but he's playing it as though it were a cello.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, Blossom's assailant is what's probably a man clad in the same black and red Cathak armor that the rest of this unit of guardsmen is wearing. He's got a very nice bow, though, a curve of glittering steel strung with what might be silk. None of his fellows care, as far as you can tell.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The more he watches, the more Tatsuya gets the idea that very few of the musicians here are, like... real? Or, at least, possessed of independent vitality. The great majority of them, particularly those with leafy features or who are literally just stubby-limbed, leaf-masked plants, look to be nothing more than extensions of the dozing sylvan giant - who's got to be some kind of </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>visitor or immigrant to this particular freehold, since her aesthetic's so far off from that of most of the denizens Tatsuya's seen around.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>One of the musicians, that woman with the flute, is a (mutated and ensorcelled) human, but she's nothing special as flautists go. The little cello-playing turnip, too, seems self-willed somehow - but, in particular, is still an offshoot or even belonging of the greater fairy. Like, he sort of fades a bit when she's not paying  attention to him directly.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Sabotaging the orchestra probably means sabotaging the raksha that owns it, somehow, OR symbolically stealing the performers or their instruments </span><span class='u c12'>from</span><span class='c12'> the raksha.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, he doesn't currently have a way to make fire on hand, so the easiest way of sabotage is out. Stealing performers and/or instruments, however... that can be done.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's still biding her time. Probably not worth it making many waves until the social event she's been sponsored for.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Much more dangerous than the poorly-aimed boulders is a reverse rainstorm of deadly arrows! Neither Solar is actually scathed, but Blossom's all but fallen out of the Stormwind Rider in the course of evading the countless arrowheads. It's awful when enemy forces are both well-trained and lucky.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>One arrow can be dodged, but dozens? Blossom's hands fly to slap the missiles out of the air before they can hit her, but they're faster than she can move and she's losing ground quickly!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>C'monnnnnnn</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> "Get LOST!" <span class='c7'>Blossom cups her hands and grows a rapidly spinning sphere of fire between them, throwing it at the enraged Dynast. The flames themselves might not bother a child of that element, but the force of the impact still sends him reeling!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Dynast: </span>"Gyaaah! You think your- you think that's- rrggh-...!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, it seems to me that Tatsuya's at liberty to attempt to sneak in and work some kind of sabotage right now, or brazenly confront the wood-raksha for whatever reason, or lay low and wait for a better or more obvious opportunity. Meanwhile, Ir's got little to do but see to the occasional favors her patron might ask of her until such time as the sun sets and she's taken to play </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>at the castle.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>As Blossom aims a firebolt at her almost-hidden assailant, she might be given to notice a flickering of crimson starlight just under the brow of his helmet...</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Blossom meets the eye of the man who launched the counterstroke, but he looks - uncertain, almost panicked.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Nope nope nope. Last time Eikichi flew into battle with Blossom in the Rider he had to wash her blood out of his hair. Looks like Team Solar's blasting off again...!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Now that Eikichi's wise to the way this dynast moves, he can counter it - sort of suck in the bottom of the stormwind rider to deny the man any rungs or shelfs of whirling air, spin and bulge the center to dislodge him and push him backwards. In a blur of motion, the two Solars have hitched themselves back over the cliff face they dropped down from, and while a torrent of rocks and </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>arrowheads comes drumming against the stone or flying over their heads, it's not enough to so much as slow them down.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Tatsuya's just about ready to creep out of line of sight entirely when he notices the golden gleam of a half-lidded eye is aimed right at him.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir might as well keep tabs on him, but she's not going to creep around the damn village after him or anything.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Shit. Let his guard down. He turns towards the raksha as casual as someone who just got caught sneaking around can possibly be. </span>"It's... pretty good."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Will he, though, Eikichi's and Blossom are given to wonder.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Crimson? What does that mean?</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Hwaaah! ...okay, so this looks a lot more like a normal mining camp. Railways along which carts piled with rubble are being pushed, tents and cabins and lean-tos holding the laborers, a contingent of mortal guards.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir spends her next however long practicing a new technique -- changing Iscariot's shape from a six-string to other, longer-bodied string instruments in the middle of the song. It's not the shaping itself that's hard -- the moonsilver is very responsive. It's the tuning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0kQKdv_FBU</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"The little one, with the fiddle. And the lady with the flute.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>She laughs to herself, pleased as punch as far as Tatsuya can tell. </span>"Yes! Yes, how I love him. I should name him soon."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eikichi can tell, looking at the carts of excavated rubble, that this is definitely where the earth-shaping gemstone is at work; rather than craggy and rough-edged as they would be if worked loose by picks and hammers, the the chunks of liberated earth here are rounded, visibly kneaded into shape by palm and fingerprints. The grade of the material, though, suggests it's been dug up </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>from quite deep indeed... meaning the hearthstone itself isn't up here in the camp.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The digging operation must have proceeded far enough apace that they've moved the hearthstone itself down into the tunnels so as to extend the radius of hand-workable stone as deep as can be.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Tunnel big enough to fly into?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Up here, you'll find those laborers currently off their shifts, and, unfortunately, a small army of highly-alarmed guards.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It is, but you don't know how long it stays wide enough. At the moment, Cathak soldiers are rushing to raise the alarm and block off the entrance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"...so he plays like that and doesn't even have a name? What's his. I dunno. How's he do that?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Tatsuya's interlocutor peers at him further. </span>"Oh, you know.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Raksha: </span>"I forgot what I put into this little one, honestly. But he hasn't bored me yet. You don't know any good names, do you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"I'm terrible with them, honestly."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Raksha: </span>"Mmm, then I'll keep looking. I just hope he doesn't disappoint... though perhaps it wouldn't be too bad if he did."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Soon Ir will have teased out three specific variants of Iscariot, the stringed instrument -- the six-string, a larger four stringed variant she drops down like a cello, and a fiddle she can pop up onto her shoulder. The hard part -- the really hard part -- is teasing out a bow. The moonsilver doesn't want to separate, and definitely doesn't want to provide the friction against itself </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>necessary for sound. Soon she figures out the trick: some hair from Errant's mane and some careful practice, and the bow will leap out of the instrument's body, thread the bowstring, and remain connected by the thinnest tendril while playing.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Raksha: </span>"This is a nice place, but... staying...? Mmmm..."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She probably can't get a full string standup bass out of this thing, sadly -- not with the right sound, anyway.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>But wind instruments might be a fun challenge down the line.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eikichi's not wrong. It's a harrowing dive straight down over the lip of a cliff face and then into a wide mine tunnel atop a magical whirlwind, but, apparently, a possible one - the motion's so fast and sudden that the Cathak guards have only started firing arrows by the time Eikichi and Blossom are already deep into the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It starts branching, though...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Might be worth sticking around. You never know who might show up here to keep things interesting."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Raksha: </span>"Mmm. Well... the same to you, human. I hope I'll see you tonight. ...stick around for the rehearsal, if you like." <span class='c12'>She turns again, shifting idly until she's lying on her back with one great arm hanging down so her fingers brush the auditorium floor. Beneath and beside her, her orchestra plays on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, that went poorly. It could've gone worse, but he still hasn't actually managed to help Ir at all.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>We've all been there.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Well, if nothing else it's intel. The weak spot in the orchestra is the mortal - of which there's only one, which is a good thing if you're worried about being able to collect people quickly and completely - and the star performer's a semi-autonomous belonging of a raksha master. Conceivably you could do something with any or all of that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Of course, Tatsuya still has the opportunity for some kind of insane hit and run here.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It'd be a shame, of course... why not just kick back and listen?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Ir's probably got it all under control. What's the harm in just listening to some tunes?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Blossom and Eikichi race along the mine tunnels, following the handprints dug into the walls and the sparkling, pearly gradient of the distant hearthstone's power that only Eikichi can actually see. For a while they're able to whirl down broad, well-lit, and widely-excavated tunnels, but it's not long before Eikichi's forced to throttle the Stormwind Rider's speed and then either </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>fold it into its personal transport mode or banish it all together.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Let's just walk.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Then it's just running - maybe walking, as Eikichi's going to get winded - towards the prize. The deeper you go, the more actual miners you see, but it seems like some kind of alarm's been raised already - they mostly scream and dive for side tunnels as they see you approaching. You can hear the shouting and marching of the guardsmen somewhere behind you, but you've got a substantial </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>head start.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"Whew! This is a lot easier than the other one."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>You turn a corner, and there you are - a wide, partially-excavated hall. On a pedestal rests what must be the Earth-Shaping Jewel, an egg of gleaming amber ensconced within a half-complete shell of craggy granite. Right before it, crouched in some sort of meditation, is Cathak Kalza - she's fully armored, holding her reaper daiklave before her, a few inches of the gleaming silver-blue </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>blade visible between the hilt and the scabbard. The terrestrial exalt has her head bowed and is murmuring to herself, and Eikichi can see some kind of magic being drawn forth out of the blade, swirling around Kalza's head and pouring into her anima.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Uh-</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Is she praying to it?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Beside Kalza is a huge man with a hammer that glows with furnace heat. Flanking both terrestrials is a contingent of Cathak soldiers; cowering away from it all are a number of workers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Elsewhere, Tatsuya and Ir, in their own ways, wile away the day. If Tatsuya wants to just chill and enjoy some tunes, he's unbothered; any castle guards that come marching down the hall are simply shooed away by the gigantic Miaja before they can notice and object to the mortal interloper. Ir, meanwhile, is largely unmolested by the other denizens of the freehold; as she's in Rajiezna's </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>care, she won't be challenged by the guard or dragooned into the military or similar.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>She's talking to the sword. And the sword's talking back.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Whoa.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Day turns to dusk turns to night, and soon Ir's summoned - the political affairs of the Daylit Court have been concluded, and so it's time for the much more important matters of mingling, gossip, and revelry. Does Ir suffer to be dressed up?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Similarly, does Tatsuya want to join the orchestra? He can get set up with a whistle, or maybe some drums...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He'll leave that to the professionals. Besides, he's here to support Ir. He'll have to find a place where he can do so, in case things go south.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The moment Eikichi and Blossom step into the room, Kalza snaps her head up to glare at them, Kalza's ally snorts and seizes the hearthstone in one gauntleted hand, and Kalza's troops raise their weapons.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Hrmph.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Sure, why not. But she'll keep her armor close.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The lady Rajiezna likes reds, yellows, floppy hats, and enormous feathers. Ir makes it look good, though. (That's in comparison to Rajiezna and closer members of her retinue, who make it look sublime if you ignore the too-perfect symmetries and other uncanny elements of faerie appearance). So it is that the Solar skald finds herself marching into a great ballroom sort of chamber a </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>few hours past sunset.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir has, at this point, a good headcount of mortals present in the Freehold. She counts four of them here - one in the orchestra, three others acting as servants or squires for the attending raksha. She knows there are maybe twenty in total back in the rest of the Freehold, either sleeping in beds, sweeping streets, or tending to the graveyard outside the church.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>There's an orchestra playing at the side of the room, of course, framed against a great opening in the castle wall such that just a few pillars, veils, and curtains of vines separate them from the night sky. If Tatsuya isn't formally among them, he's teeeechnically not allowed to be here... and is therefore, presumably, hiding or in disguise.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>When she walks in, she'll be wearing Iscariot as a serpentine armband bracelet that twists up around each arm decoratively, across her shoulders, and down the other arm. She's not showing an immodest amount of skin, but she's showing enough that the whole of the weapon is visible.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She realized while dressing she's looking less muscular and more simply athletic these days, though her battle prowess hasn't suffered for it. Consequence of a having a residency rather than tromping around the wastes climbing every damn thing for months. Irritating in some respects, but she does make the dress look good.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He's there, but out of view. Little trickier to make work than a disguise, but less risk of getting called out.</span></p>

There's a bearded, golden-eyed old man in long white robes... Xalvierre, the mountain-dwelling master. There's an armed and armored woman easily seven feet tall with a great mane of </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>blood-red hair... the captain of the guard, Corazelle. Then there's the royals.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The king of the daylit court, a short, portly, white-haired elf who everyone only refers to by his title. The beloved princess Naeva, a slim and solemn figure whose features are mostly hidden by white veils. The high priest of the Church of Balor, a hunched and fussy-looking faerie called Narvithex whose eyes and mouth are hidden by bushy brows and a bushy mustache, respectively. Ir </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>knows all these names because the lords and ladies around her whisper them to each other.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Here's the scheduling: there'll be some mingling, then some performances - music included - then more mingling, then around midnight the night will be largely over. Ir gets the sense that there'll be a bit of an unspoken competition in the middle there, but mostly what's at stake is the relative status of the raksha present. If she wants to throw down some kind of gauntlet or otherwise </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>toss a wrench into the workings of the court, she'll have to pick her moment and then, well, do it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Underground, Eikichi and Blossom can tell that they're in easily the most viable of Cathak's digs. The very wall behind Kalza is mostly intact stone, but visible through a few cracks and finer-swipes is a glittering basalt reminiscent of the Sword pylon the Circle first convened at far to the north.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Given your location relative to the middle of the range, that's probably some kind of peripheral stabilizing infrastructure rather than an entrance to the pylon proper, but still.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Maybe they were right? Anyway, he still has his phone, and all the time in the world to think about what he’ll do next. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The helicopter rises into the night. Below, he can see Blythe watching from the edge of the helipad, and as they lift off higher and higher, he can see the light of the estate and its vast gardens shrink smaller and smaller, an island in the dark desert. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Hall’s hand jerks out of Tommy’s, like she’s been bitten. “Oh.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Baroness smiles, her fangs extended as well. “I suppose things are different down here.” She looks Tommy up and down. “Yes, thank you.” She enters the conference room. Will they follow? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Indeed.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will step into the room, cup of coffee and saucer in hand, and set them down at the head of the table at the end closest to the door.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy follows them in, silent but with a sanguine impression.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Wilson’s ride moves swiftly over the dark hills separating Lancaster from the rest of the County.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Pearl: “Aren’t your friends down there?” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Two of the three in the conference room as Hall, Cav, and Tommy take their seats turn to look. Seated at the figure at the end of the table’s right is a young man with shoulder-length blonde hair, a nervous smile playing around on his features. At the figure’s left is a older man, fine scarring running across his nose and brow. His facial hair is combed into a neatly cropped beard and spike moustache. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ's still got the blush of life about her, so the oddly perceptive Pearl Bernstein might detect a soul in conflict.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Which is true, because if Bren wins tonight and Murray thinks that report was too-long delayed...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Dwarfing both, the Count of Long Beach stands at the far end of the table, unmoving, limbs hidden in his robe, features hidden behind a white porcelain mask. The mask, Cav notes, is smiling. The last time he saw Bren, in the whorl of combat at Bressi Ranch, it was frowning. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I am well, Baron. There is much we have to discuss.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jessie bangs the table with her hand. “Are you just gonna leave him out to dry??” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Before Cav clarifies, the three people with Bren look around the room as if expecting him to fall out of the ceiling. At the mention of coffee, Hall gets up to get a cup. “Not like I was planning on sleeping…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The Deacon folds his hands on the table, shrugs. </span>"A lot has been happening."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Bren’s total lack of movement makes him hard to read.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "I'm sure it was."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jessie realizes KJ’s position. “Oh, wait you work for Murray. Hmm…well, you should find a way to screw them both! And be able to live for yourself!” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Cav gets a text. </span>&lt;5 minutes.&gt;</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Hall returns with a coffee and the saucer full of creamer cups, which she begins to pour one after the other. “No thanks to your friend, Deacon.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav's voice loses a bit of its solicitous good-humor.</span> "Morgan will shoulder his fair share of the blame for what happened on my territory, Baroness."</p>

There’s a long column of ten or so black SUVs weaving effortlessly in and out of the traffic of other cars as they pass, so well-coordinated it almost appears to be one large vehicle. Forr a moment, it appears that they’re keeping pace with the helicopter, but </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> that’s impossible, and Wilson’s ride soon leaves them behind. Still, though, they must have been pushing a hundred. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jessie: “Yeah!! Let’s go down there. I want to see the werewolf for once.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>There's the sound of a helicopter outside the S&C offices.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> They have. Cav must recognize Sherman Ma from the ballet and other functions, although he seemd to be almost emotionless compared to the extremely angry person Cav meets coming up the stairs. Also, he wasn’t wearing full plate, embedded with rubies and fine red scrollwork, or carrying a greatsword. His dark skin is flushed red for good measure. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy tears into another piece of cake. </span>"Thish ish so fucking good."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's night time in the Daylit Court. The place </span><span class='u c12'>does</span><span class='c12'> live up to its name, though; as late as it gets, the sky never quite loses the rosy blush of distant sunset. Somehow, this doesn't stop the stars from shining clearly down from the sky directly above the castle.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>As the Unconquered Sun appearing to linger in these lands is a fully cosmetic effect, Ir doesn't take much solace in it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir and Tatsuya are both part of the ongoing festivities, and both blending in in their own ways. Dressed up outlandishly, Ir's part of the retinue of one Lady Rajienza, marched into the grand hall alongside acrobats, jugglers, trained bears, and the like. Meanwhile, Tatsuya's completely out of sight, at times shuffling unseen between courtiers and at other times clinging to the sides </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>of pillars or sidling behind pieces of furniture.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Here's what Ir and Tatsuya pick up, from the chatter: the foul depredations of the Nightwreathed Court continue apace, corrupting the mountains and abducting or consuming their innocent denizens. It's only possible or practical for the daylit knights to defend or rescue so many people at once, so everyone's got their hopes pinned on the efforts of the Hero.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>As well, grim tidings of some sort have darkened the mood of old sage Xalvierre... knight-captain Corazelle has imposed structure on the knights, but everything seems tense... high priest Narvithex is always at the old king's ear...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Actually, that kind of thing is often repeated in those exact words by one courtier to another, sometimes passing between the same two people for the second time in a matter of minutes. The impression you get is that there are maybe five or six self-willed beings in the room, discounting yourselves and the two mortals present - one a flautist in Miaja's orchestra, the other an old </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>and tired-looking butler.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Formal performances and so on are due to start soon, so if there's anywhere you want to sneak off to, anyone you want to conspire with or interview, or whatever, now's the time.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Meanwhile, Blossom and Eikichi have just thundered into a wide hall that House Cathak has been excavating under the Hedgehog mountain range. They're here to destroy or at least steal the Earth-Shaping Stone that allows the mining to proceed as quickly as it has, but said stone's just been picked up and pocketed by a huge, armor-clad Dragon-Blood hefting what looks like a gigantic </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>smith's hammer. Beside him, Cathak Kalza is sheating her reaper daiklave dramatically at her side and settling into a combat stance. Around both are a contingent of guards, and some miners who are huddling at the corners of the room.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya's comfortably in position in case things go awry. There's not that much he needs to know, either - win the humans back or take them by force, then this place gets reshaped soon anyway.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Not even enough setup for a team monologue. Ugh.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi tosses his hair impatiently.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The only person Ir might benefit from a strategy session with is Tatsuya himself, and he'll have to instigate that one.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya's currently hiding behind a pillar, though he keeps shifting and putting his hands in his pockets. Something seems to trouble him.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>It's rather easy to find him.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>...Well, no it isn't.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>But, it's a lot easier than it would be if you didn't already know where to look. She still needs to wander the edge of the room to just the right angle and then actually walk forward out onto the dance floor to make sure it's him. Luckily the dancers themselves have clockwork precision, and she times it not to get in anyone's way.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>There's some dancing, some gossip, some feasting - although, if you pay attention, none of the actual lords and ladies in attention eat anything substantive. All throughout, the court orchestra plays background music, the twelve foot tall green woman who controls it lounging and sometimes outright sleeping in its vicinity. Then, Ir's... sponsor? Keeper? Steps forward to address the </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>circle of fae around the throne.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> "I've a new one - a <span class='u '>great</span> one. She can match our guest, I've no doubt." <span class='c12'>This appears to rouse Miaja from her nap, while at the same time the king and a variety of nobles mutter gravely to themselves and each other.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Ir finds herself being pushed and prodded to the edge of the faerie orchestra, where she finds herself staring at a motley of seeming humans and plant-creatures, behind all of whom a green woman lounges like a tiger on a broad dais. Green woman ("Miaja"): </span>"Then... you'll no longer wish my-" "Quite the contrary! You might have more to learn."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's tetchy enough just about being here that the pushes and prods better take the hint when she moves in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Miaja eyes Ir. </span>"So... visitor. You're a musician?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I'm lots of things." <span class='c4'>Ir snaps out her arm and extends her wrist up, fingers arched as if holding the neck of an imaginary fiddle, and Iscariot slithers across her bare shoulders to gather in just the shape they're waiting for.</span> "Musician's one."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Miaja's eyes light up. </span>"And a magician! Where did you get it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The end of another world." <span class='c4'>Poetically true, especially in the Pneuman tradition with regards to the First Age.</span> "It's a key. I just keep finding different locks."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>This appears to delight and amaze pretty much Ir's entire audience; the faeries gasp or titter to themselves or even coo like children. Miaja, for her part, just stares with glittering eyes. </span>"Oh. Ohhh that's lovely. But... it's older than you, I think. And so am I."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi's right hand rises and his anima spreads out like fanning wings, blue-gold light framing a barrage of obsidian that clatters off the Dynasts' armor, leaving them unharmed.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>They're not gonna want to turn around.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "Yeah. Reason for that is, I'm mortal. Y'all, well...Y'all come from circumstances."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Funny thing about that. I look around and I'm not the only one."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Essence flares in the Cathak mines. A formation of soldiers goes charging forward, imbued with Cathak Zoltet's inspiring flames, only to be cut down near-instantly by a hail of sorcery. Cathak Kalza, blazing like a comet, charges into the Solar ranks like a woman possessed, but blow after blow is parried or dodged depending on its target.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Miaja's orchestra plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRWq53IFXVQ</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's a jaunty tune that puts one in mind of warm breezes and sandy shores. It's literally enchanting, but Ir and Tatsuya both get the idea that the sorcerous, addictive properties of the music currently sliding off them like water would off a duck aren't even intentional - the green fairy's just that enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Hrmph! Pitiful.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The pale woman playing a flute at the edge of the orchestra can barely keep up with the goblins and wood sprites, and it's impossible to ignore the few sour notes she issues, but Miaja merely looks upon her with a patient, magnanimous pity.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eventually, the song concludes, and two by two the eyes of the court turn to Ir. Miaja's certainly do. Her expression says: show me what you got.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Hmph. Tatsuya watches from the rafters, looming over everything like some kind of phantom. He's still wary of anything moving against Ir, despite the relaxed mood... Miaja's good.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi holds the Linchpin back like a scorpion's tail, and the sorcerer's anima tinges green and white. After a moment, his eyes and Kalza's burn the same, and Kalza staggers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>...Ir's better.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir listens, takes the mood in of the song, notes that the flautist's bit doesn't really play -- probably because it's bullshit she's here at all -- and realizes that even if most of these aren't really people in the strictest sense, they're trapped in a martial paradigm that's contradicted by them not being able to </span><span class='i c4'>do</span><span class='c4'> shit. So let's work that into the idea of going home.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "This is an old song, from far away. But it's about being home, and being willing to fight for that."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's turn at the stage is loud, grinning, and swaggering in tone: an intentional provocation. She's not looking to start a fight, per se, but she is trying to get peoples' blood racing. For the mortals here that seems to be a serious problem.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Feet tap. Ears twitch. The nobles of the Daylit Court wake up a little, as late as it is; the old, weary king is rubbing at his eyes, the high priest at his side is looking jumpy, the knight-captain is pacing back and forth like a caged beast. Miaja's perched on her stand like a gargoyle now, eyeing Ir almost hungrily, and when the song concludes the room bursts into riotous applause </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>and cheering.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> "Ah... eh... exc-excellent! Oh, my, yes. Love... lovely...!" <span class='c12'>That's the king, who's not actualy raised his voice to be heard by the entire court for the entire night. His attending priest makes soothing motions at him, and the princess sitting nearby, clad almost entirely in white veils, raises a long finger to her chin in a gesture of growing intrigue. Soon, she's leaning over to </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>whisper to the monarch, and though what actually passes between them i obscured by a round of congratulations for the raksha lady who brought Ir to the court in the first place, pretty soon an elfin majordomo is tugging at one of Ir's sleeves.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The princess would like to meet her, it seems.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Elsewhere, a storm of crashing swords and burning hammers are just rebounding one after the other off Spite's Linchpin. There's a real madness in Kalza's eyes - she knows what Eikichi did to her memories, and she's going to exact a price for it come hell or high water.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi's eyes flash too, and unlike the swordmaster or the general, his attack hits home. Looks like it was Hell that came.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That's no real surprise. That is how it usually goes in the stories.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir will bid Iscariot return to its decorative form -- she makes it look nice, since she's pretty certain not all of that hunger in Miaja's eyes was for her alone -- and accept the summons.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Well, Ir doesn't have to play along, strictly speaking. If she wants to, though, she's ushered to a balcony adjoining but not actually directly open to the main hall. She walks past a pair of guards who uncross and re-cross their halberds mechanically to find herself staring besides Naeva, who's a tall, spare figure so completely enfolded by white robes and veils that the only features </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>of hers that can be made out at the moment are the long, indigo-hued fingers with which she clutches the balcony railing.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Naeva: </span>"You've... you're different. Where do you come from. Not the mountains?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Guessing this one's no mortal either.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Oh, no, Naeva's almost certainly a full-fledged Raksha. Does Tatsuya move to monitor the meeting, incidentally, or does he have other priorities in the court?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He'll stick close. Separating Ir could be a ploy, though it didn't seem like one... but it never hurts to be careful.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "Not from the mountains. Not from the seas beyond them, either, but that's closer."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Naeva: </span>"Were you - were you made by someone else?"</p>

And yet, there she goes, screaming and collapsing into ash and carbon.

All those told to leave, who don’t, are guilty of treason and will suffer accordingly.” Her strained voice is backed up by her terrible red </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It is. Speaking of, Bren hasn’t moved. Apparently the commotion wasn’t enough to stir him. As people file in, his mask inclines slightly. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Blythe takes the news evenly from Wilson. It doesn’t seem to be something she was expecting, but it’s also a better outcome than nobles killing each other.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Yep. Everything. Also whatever weird shit Cavanaugh got from those diaries.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Blythe stops Wilson when he’s reading her the transcript of the diaries. “Wait, three siblings in Los Padres?” </p>

She's got less reason to hate Count Bren than she thought, and it might be best to reconcile him and the target if possible.. Cavanaugh doesn't deserve what's happening here. At least not more than anyone else in the Invictus. But this 'illness', the timing of it.. the mentions of amnesia earlier. And whatever the heck is in those diaries.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Solitude loses his king, and resets the pieces. “A fundamental restructuring. Examining the system and altering it in a way more permanent than aspirational.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"What sort of research?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “The proprietary sort.” Solitude loses a knight. “No offense meant, Wilson.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Solitude: “He didn’t mention the color of the sun, did he?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"He did."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"I'm not looking to copy you. I just want to know what you think is better than this."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Solitude thinks. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Understand that I don’t mean to approach this work in a moral capacity. When you say “better”, what could you mean? I only mean more fitting, in the sense of the engineer. I’m uninterested in what someone might do with a transfigured capacity. I’m much more interested in how achieve a different capacity in the first place.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He motions to the chessboard. “If you want a metaphor, I can give you one.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Look at this pawn. It can only move one space. Its sole limitation. Now imagine it had a mind. Passions, dreams, consciousness, a family, a history, whatever. And whatever it contained in itself, it would only exist in the mold of that limitation, of only moving a certain way, one space at a time, in one direction.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Sure."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “If it reaches the end of the board, it’s transformed. It can move an infinite number of spaces, in any direction. This is the first transformation - say, your rebirth as kindred. But the passions, the understanding, the mind, they remain the same. It has infinite freedom, and nothing to fill it with. It can go in one direction, one space at a time, the only motion it can imagine, even after this change in essence. The interior hasn’t </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> caught up to the exterior. What I’m interested in is a secondary transformation. What if we could alter the essence-inside-the-essence? So that the pawn could find something to fill that space with? What directions could it travel then? All of them, for any length.” He puts the pawn back down. “Not that I would know what that’s like. But the possibility is the intriguing part, for now.” He laughs. “Until you really can perceive </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> your own transformation, I suppose. Then little of what interests us now would suffice.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Solitude: “Sure. What do you do with it?” He shrugs. “Who knows? Whatever you like.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "But what sort of ant looks at a man and says 'I bet I could become that'."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “As for stasis…yes and no. Much of it is just culturally encouraged.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Everybody can think of things they want to change about themselves.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"A lot of it is cultural, but culture's as hard to change as anything else is."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Makes it easy to see why someone'd get tired of it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Solitude: “You know, someone else is just as interested in that as I am with the individual.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “You meet all kinds of interesting people, actually.

Another asks why only here, why this context, maybe the infinite movement is fitted to an infinite space.” He mimes the pawn </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> transforming into a rocket, taking off. “Pwwsh.” He smiles. “Hard to find a sufficient budget for that last one.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"Huh."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "But on some level, you're still describing the pawn's logic, yeah?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The smile fades. “Some get lost trying to prematurely grasp something else.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"All these changes, all these unimaginable perspectives and possibilities... they're still anchored in the way the pawn sees the world." <span class='c10'>He slides one frmo the home row up two squares. </span>"There is only forward."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He checks his watch. “Hm. That went fast. I’ll have to come see you more often, Wilson. I’ve got to get back to Westwood. There’s someone who’s been a pain in my ass lately, who I still - well, you know how office politics are.” He gets his coat. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson'll walk him out. </span>"Please. Don't be a stranger, Sol."</p>

The madness and violence of the last few days is over, finally. Or at least, partly. Cav and Wilson might have unexpected houseguests, but otherwise they have no pressing matters. KJ has a lead on some more Circle information, and no request for an update from the good Baron Murray's people. That last bit is a bit odd; usually she relies o</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> n a constant stream of information from her minions. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Tommy can hear the front door open, shortly followed by a crash of paper.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy is genuinely speechless for a bit here. </span>"...You want <span class='b '>me</span> to head up one of your projects?

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>God, Wilson has no idea who's going to be there or what people are going to be doing. The last time he walked into a room this blind was the night he got introduced to Court.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There isn't a dress code, although the general crowd Solitude hangs out with means, y'know, dress up. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>It's been a few months since Wilson drove, and it's been a few decades since he drove to get somewhere on purpose, but they make these cars basically idiot-proof these days and your phone will read the directions to you out loud in a patient nursemaid voice.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely's house is completely different from the last time Cav was there. All the trash has been cleaned up, for one. Leisurely greets him at the door in a sky-blue cocktail dress, her cornflower yellow hair combed out and pinned up, rather than in her usual braids. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle: "Well, in your...emphasis...you get exposed to a lot of danger. I thought that, well, you shouldn't have to be alone all the time. So, I talked to Presbyter Sauer and she said she had something that might help." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> "Good evening, Leisurely. You look fantastic." <span class='c4'>And her dress matches...his tie. Coincidence, or remote viewing? Best not to think about it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer clears a space for the suitcase on a desk. "How do you feel about minor outpatient surgery? Also, you don't have any fillings, do you?" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's wearing a gently pinstriped dark blue-gray suit and his tie has some kind of diamond pattern on it. Nora had them on the right side of the closet which is the 'wear this if there are going to be people' side.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The textstorm seems to be clearing. KJ gets up and heads inside, through the townhouse to the alley and the office. Now, who's on duy tonight..</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>To tell the truth (in the privacy of her own head) she's a bit worried. These recent events have made her aware just how shitty mortal agents, ghoul or otherwise, might be at keeping track of a vampire who doesn't want to be tracked.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely beams. "Thank you. Are you planning on exhibiting yourself tonight?" She walks with him back to the car and gets in. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "I uh..." <span class='c14'>The Deacon would blush, if he could spare it. Vitae's a bit tight after that run-in out in the canyon. </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer lifts a scalpel. "Silver's fine. Some of the modern composite mixtures can disrupt radio frequencies if they're too close. Should be good." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Speaking of feeling, the night overhead is cloudy. It fits with the strange mood that's settled over the city lately. It's hard to put a name to it, but...</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He follows that one up: </span>"Oh man, you are going to chip me."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> When Wilson and Cav's cars arrive, a valet ghoul either directs Nora towards parking or takes Cav's car off his hands. The building's entrance is clear of passerby, and the usual passage into the tunnel towards the basement is marked discreetly. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson tips the ghoul and heads in. He hasn't noticed anyone yet; psyching himself up to believe that leaving the house was a good idea is giving him a sort of tunnel vision.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The massive industrial elevator takes them, in whatever order they arrive, down into the pleasant - fountained and decorated - lobby leading to the larger laboratories. For Cav, this should be familiar. For Wilson, there's a massive industrial elevator in the basement of the Eastern Columbia Building that leads to a pleasant lobby far underneath. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Also, the signs in the lobby have...strange names on the little directory plaques. Rocketry? Botany? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>That's weird. This is weird. Coming here was a mistake.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Does Cav go straight in to the room marked Exhibits? Or does he linger in the lobby? Leisurely seems content to follow him around as he will. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He'll linger in the lobby for a few minutes, but will head into Exhibits if he doesn't run into somebody who wants to talk.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He rubs the back of his neck. It's got a pebbled texture. </span>"So... you kinda make it sound like a chip."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Did the email say what room the meeting was in?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Speaking of the lobby, there's no one Cav will recognize, just a balding, white-bearded man who keeps checking his pocket watch. He'll bow politely when he sees them. "Visionary. Slave." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It did not. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ's ghouls report all systems running well. As it turns out, once you set up the lines of governance, there's not much hands on work to do if you just want a base level of functioning. Now, aggressive expansion and crisis management is something else...but she doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle: "No. I thought you might want company, not just a knowledge that we know where you are. A...reference book and helper, that sort of thing. A radio transmitter so you can hear us, a microphone so we can hear you, and a camera so we can see what you're seeing." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Ugh. At this point Wilson starts looking for people. Who does he see first?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Before Cav can correct him, he'll notice a familiar face walk into the lobby and look around as if he's lost. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy quirks his brow and raises his phone.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav breaks into a smile.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>To Leisurely:</span> "I didn't know Wilson Frost was in our little group."</p>

Not that the oldschool Invictus obsession with </span><span class='i c6'>territory</span><span class='c6'> is really what matters. </span>"OK. 'Gadget', over the next week I'd like you to put together a survey on the kindred who've been feeding here - we're going to take names and home territories at minimum, and whatever else they'll give you without getting hostile. Expect a lot of lies, but I'll be following up on those until people get the message."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "'Quimby', I want you to look into defenses against telepathy. Beg or buy access to peoples' libraries - I've discovered that we're being surveilled in a way which may or may not be possible to prevent.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely's face turns from a placid, friendly, vacant smile into a terrified, stricken grimace. She turns and walks towards the bathroom. "Um- I...You go ahead-" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>...</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav is over there in a flash.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer laughs. "Yeah, what, you're just going to have us on a call 24/7, and always have one hand full? Look, we're just going to put a couple tiny things in your head-" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "I could wear a gopro," <span class='c14'>he adds nervously.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>That's unusual.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle leans forward in a placating fashion. "Deacon, I'd like you to try it. The surgery - well, let's not even call it that. The installation will be painless. It's totally reversible. I just want you to be able to access an operator at all times. Myself and Presbyter Sauer will be on call at all hours if you need us. We want to give you a connection that we've failed to provide you so far." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav, voice low:</span> "Do you want to leave?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely squats behind the plant, blocking sight of Wilson. "No, it's just..." </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's at a loss.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Leisurely: "I was his secretary. For about forty years. That was my day job. Of course, I never did anything. But he didn't seem to notice, so..." </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She looks downtrodden. "Everybody here knows me as the Visionary, but what if he thinks its...stupid..." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav blinks rapidly.</span> "Wait-- but--"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Wow okay we're just gonna do it right here. Hoo, okay."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Tommy feels a pressure against his throat. "Best not to talk for this one," says Clarabelle. Sauer's little hands move against his skin. What she's doing exactly, he can't see. In a few minutes, she goes over to the case and comes back with some suture. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> A few minutes later: "Okay, go ahead and say something." She checks a digital readout in the case. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Did you fuck up my voice?" <span class='c14'>he squeaks/</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Well, it's not that big of a lobby, and Leisurely didn't use obfuscate, so unless his attention was fixed elsewhere Wilson saw everything. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer calls out from the other room. "It'll short out!" </p>

In the bright moonlight falling down from the great opening in the ceiling, some far distance above, they can see him well: a man some years past late middle age, slightly bent with age, still with a head full of white hair, wearing a quiet suit that seems neither unfashionably bulky or fashionably fitting. </p>

With the seeming end of the Sponger affair, Tommy has some free time. Come to think of it, it’s the first real break he’s had in months, the tempo of sorting things out for other people having kept his schedule full. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> What does he want to do? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> And is this first feeling of existential freedom liberating, or horrifying? Hm. Clarabelle must have rubbed off on him a bit, there.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Also, why is no one returning KJ’s regular jibes and jabs? It’s like all of her social contacts, normally buzzing, have gone silent. No new texts…</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Tommy spends more than a little time trying to see if he, like, can spot a bunch of wires, electronics, etc. hanging in space in the desk mirror in his room beneath Soria's peublo mission. No such luck. Still, as he sits on his bed and kneads his throat, he has a moment of clarity. How is this freaking thing powered? Does it have batteries? Are they gonna have to like, put batteries </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ received a present, last week, from a secret admirer. The money is money, the bullets she's had traced to the Wilderness Commission.. but that leaves the gun and the note, both things you *handle*. It's not only mysterious stoners who can draw out information from the Blood alone.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle: “Well, I just have to have a radio signal, I think. I’m not quite up to speed on the exact mechanical details. I think it has something to do with sending tiny electronic impulses into the parts of your body that need to be used. Or…something like that.” She pauses. “A bomb?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She unlocks enough doors to head over to the office and pick them up. The gun, first: ignoring ghouls who're finding out just now that there's a mysterious rifle in the box on that side of the room, KJ sits down on a table, stills herself, and wraps both hands around the long shaft on her lap</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "You could do it, though, right? I mean, how could I tell?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle: “Oh…I don’t really know how to make bombs. Or how to put them in people. I guess if you hear ticking, you should start to worry.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Oh." <span class='c14'>He reticulates his fingers on-camera. </span>"So you don't really... this was mostly Sauer's idea, then?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "I just had this sudden panic that I was going to wake up in the middle of stealing like, a diamond or something, with you guys remotely controlling me while I'm daysleeping. That's, that's crazy right."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I don’t think we can make you do things.” Clarabelle thinks about it. “I wanted something like this to help people who were helping us.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>'Oh man,' Tommy thinks to himself privately. 'I'm definitely gonna die'.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>What's so special about this garden anyway? It grows in moonlight, not sunlight?</span></p>

Baron Murray wasn't a very good teacher, or at least she didn't want to appear to be. On one level it comes so naturally to KJ, the shadows at her fingertips, the gun as a representation of its owner - after all, they don't kill people by themselves. On another.. she's not really sure what she's doing. Just how it feels. Maybe she really does need access to that trove of books, once Cavanaugh's free later on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> "Okay, well, I'm not really doing anything important, so.. I'm gonna go... do my own thing. Kay, thanks... uh bye."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The warehouse office has people discussing trivia, movements of money and of people.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;tom&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He sits in silence, eyes narrowed. Nothing? No voices? Okay, good. He turns to his phone.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ’s sense of sight leaves her for a moment, and rushes into the rifle. She can hear…voices, faintly. They’re discussing some sort of…inventory order. Then, that dissolves into a smell of cordite and gunpowder, and a series of distant bangs. She can see a woman at a firing range, short brown hair and protective eyewear, making a series of perfect circles in a target…and then she sees it being placed in the duffel bag, </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> along with the bullets. She can see the same woman, making a note of some kind on a clipboard. KJ can peer over her shoulder…and sees her marking a number of rifles set back into a storage system of some kind…it looks as if she’s making some sort of clandestine adjustment. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Then, she can see the duffel bag sitting in the passenger seat of a tan Honda, next to the woman, who’s breaking the law by speaking on her phone while driving. </p>

She’s only got two hands. Maybe some stuff from the library. Uh huh.” Another pause. “Ok. I’ll lose this number. Let me know what the new one is when </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> you want to talk.” The phone ends, the car comes to a halt, KJ sees her house outside the car’s window, the woman gets out, and the vision ends. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Criminality aside, KJ's taking mental note after note. Every detail of this is amazing - it's working better than before. Just a matter of practice? </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The good news is that for the most part, news in Creation travels more slowly than the Heavensward does, so you can show up in a flying ship of distinct make and not immediately find yourselves contending with your past reputations. It'll catch up, though.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Ying: </span>"We're sure. Um. Wow, it sounds really weird when I put it like that."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Our past reputations are great.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway there's not </span><span class='u c12'>really</span><span class='c12'> a subtle place to park a flying ship nearby Sijan, which is on pretty flat terrain and bounded on most sides by branches of the River of Tears.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"We should probably go the diplomatic route rather than trying to hide the Heavensward."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>But... maybe...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It's a long shot, but if you wait a few hours for that fog bank, dip behind those trees... yes, Ir can nestle the Heavensward in a handy hollow right in the middle of some nearby forest, though it'd give the lot of you a several hours' walk to Sijan proper and might mean that a random hunter or explorer finds your ship at some point down the line.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Walking is good and fine.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Also, Ir and Blossom will be riding.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi has a little cloud to sit on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>But stashing the Heavensward in a crevasse is basically what they should have been doing from the jump. So it's not the worst thing in the world when they make sure that everything is copacetic before they head out.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Soooo the forest you're using for cover </span><span class='u c12'>is</span><span class='c12'> on the outer edge of a huge wooded shadowland called the Black Chase, but you're in its outermost peripheries which are safely within the sunlit world and, in general, the dead around Sijan are known to be very well-behaved as befits the city's stellar reputation.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Now, when you say stellar-</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well. Great.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>So it is that your actual landing and disembarking is pretty uneventful. If you're particularly uncertain you may want to leave Sondok or just some blood apes back to guard the vessel, but generally your approach to Sijan is calm and uneventful.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>We've got enough erymanthoi to leave some behind to guard the ship.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Safety first.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Of greatest interest is the city itself. The closer you get to it, the more you become convinced that it's an actual ghost town - there are great structures of marble and granite and basalt stretching out before you, but no sound or motion at all visible on or between them. That's not a surprise to either Eikichi or Blossom - they know that the portion of Sijan that's above ground </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>is for the dead, not the living, and that mortals only go there on specified nights to keep things clean and give offerings.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Populated Sijan is underground, and sure enough you find an archway and down-sloping tunnel build neatly into the hillside so as not to distract from the majesty of the tombs and sepulchers directly before you.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom sniffs dismissively.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Sijan's famous for its funereal prowess throughout all the Scavenger Lands. Members of the the Funeral Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers ('the Funeary Order' for short) are in call all over the hundred kingdoms, for they know how best to hold funerals, arrange graves, and give offerings so as to forestall any kind of vengeance from beyond the grave - crucial in a land so </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>riven by wars, betrayals, and murders as this one. As well, anyone who's anyone comes to Sijan to die, or at the very least arranges to be buried there afterward, because they're sure to be granted expansive stature and grave goods so as to render them veritable emperors and empresses of the next world.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Blossom and Eikichi know that the influence of the enigmatic deathlords is, surprisingly enough, </span><span class='u c12'>not</span><span class='c12'> felt in Sijan to great degree - most of those nearby have some interest in it, to be sure, and the "Walker in Darkness" is rumored to even have a secret embassy there, but no underworld power rules the place. They needn't be wary of attack by Reckoning's like - at least, not as a </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>matter of course.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi wasn't thinking about that at all. You can tell because it hasn't poisoned his mood all day.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, you've soon walked down into the darkness to find yourselves at a toll booth/waystation sort of area at the mouth of a long tunnel. There are black-clad guards and a man in a heavy robe with silver bracer on his wrists who'd like to know who you are, what brings you to Sijan, how long you'll be staying, if you're aware of the city's laws and if you have your entrance fees at </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom doesn't really have regalia as such, which is a distressing oversight.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>There are soft gasps and other intakes of breath around the room.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>As the sign flashes, the air around her body explodes in a sunburst and radiant, shining mail coils from the light itself around her body.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That sounds like...good news.</span></p>

There's ample room in the tunnels for Errant, Eikichi gets all the snacks he wants, and the lot of you are escorted by one of Doplen's own functionaries through the entrance tunnel and into Sijan proper.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir feels even better when reunited with Errant.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"There's probably an agent somewhere in Sijan we can buy a permit from and show to a dockmaster in Nexus. Or something like that."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tatsuya: </span>"Yeah. I'm - not clear on how that'd work, but there's gotta be some kind of process in place, right?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "Sounds like something I should at least be there for, though, y'know. Language barrier. Blossom?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Well, here's how it works. Unlike Sijan, Nexus is free of top-down bureaucratic control by any governing body, and all the space there is completely free for productive beings to use as they see fit. Specifically, every inch of the city is privately owned, and there are specific cartels that jointly control all the city's available docking space.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>However, a conundrum arises, since generally docking space is taken to be the edges of the river flowing through the city. When you think about it...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Seems like we could just rent a plot of land and park there.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Say we're building a three-story building there. Say, oh, 120 twenty paces by 30 or so.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom: </span>"I'll bet I can find the right person."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "Damn straight."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>...when you think about it, there's no way that literally all the </span><span class='u c12'>air</span><span class='c12'> in Nexus is under private control, and a web of agreements and contracts ensure that like, most streets and things are free for anybody to walk around on so long as no one obstructs traffic. You don't actually </span><span class='u c12'>need</span><span class='c12'> a special dock of your own - you could just moor yourselves sufficiently high in the air and </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>stretch a rope ladder down to street level, and who's to say you're in their territory?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Can the Heavensward even masquerade as a freshwater ship for the purposes of docking the usual way at Nexus?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Now, if you want a proper dock such that teams of workmen can unload stuff from your ship or do repairs or whatever, you'll probably want to rent space near the roof of a building that itself is on or near the waterside, at which point Eikichi and Tatsuya can probably point you to a few smart choices.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"While you two make those arrangements, Tatsuya and I should probably..."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Another nod. </span>"We'll be back by tonight. Should be able to leave tomorrow morning if everything goes as planned."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir pauses.</span> "And if you're not back by then. Where should we start looking?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>for her on the small, square platform that ends this strange pillar-staircase.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>...and gently taps the sign.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Uh." <span class='c4'>Ir takes a few big steps back from the ledge.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "So how do we get water in this thing?" <span class='c4'>asks Ir, Twice Traitor, wearing a shift and some very abbreviated cotton undershorts, frowning at Blossom's big brass bathtub.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The Heavensward's essence reactor is in the next room -- actually it's kind of poking into this one a little bit -- but she's used to its thrum by now. Her room's right over it, after all.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Iscariot is curled around her head like a tiara, holding up her hair; she spends a lot of time braiding it, and that's much harder to do when wet.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> "You fill the cylindrical tank on the other side of this wall here-" <span class='c7'>She pats the bulkhead between the washroom and the essence core. </span>"And let the natural flow keep the water at a pleasant temperature. Then you turn this little valve here-" <span class='c7'>She points at a small copper pipe poking out of the wall. </span>"-to fill the tub itself."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She frowns.</span> "Do I need to fly us down to the river? Does it have, like, a straw?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>The tub is a utilitarian affair, such that Ir can still see the hammer marks from where it was worked out of raw copper. </span>"Finally, when you're done, you pull out the stopper in the bottom and let the water drain out to the bilges."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> "Oh, I just filled the tank with buckets, like every other bath."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir thought it was weird this thing even had bilges, being that it was an airship. Everything comes in handy eventually.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "So..." <span class='c4'>She walks over and hesitantly turns the valve.</span> "Let's see how this--"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Sploosh! Water begins to pour out, steaming a little.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The water sputters and shoots out from the pressure, making Ir flinch back slightly, but it settles into a smooth pour.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>How big is the tub? Can it seat four comfortably?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's used to the communal hot baths of Pneuma. That far North it's just inefficient to heat a tub for one person, after all.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>It can probably manage two. You know, if they like each other.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Fair enough. They are pressed for space.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir:</span> "Oh! Oh, no. I was just thinking of home."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "We don't have individual baths in Pneuma. Well, some of the richers do, but not most of us."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "It's wasteful to heat a bath just for one, right?" <span class='c4'>She looks around for a towel.</span> "So instead of having tubs at home, we'd have bathhouses."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom thinks for a moment. </span>"Oh, right. Heat at a premium."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> "Well, apart from that, what do you think?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir turns her back to Blossom, and in one smooth motion she pulls her top up and off while Iscariot whips out, snatches a towel from the rack she'd screwed into the wall a couple hours earlier, and cinches it around her torso.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I think it's marvelous."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "No one's ever put a hot bath on a ship. At least not that I've ever heard of."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The room is starting to fog up.</span> "Maybe we shound add some benches in here or something. You can get a steam bath in here without even getting in the water.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>She shrugs. </span>"The only reason is having to fit 150 men in a space this size. If we didn't have the core I could build a small boiler or something..."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> "Oh, that's a good thought. Maybe a hotter tank and some stones for a sauna."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She shimmies out of the undershorts underneath the towel, then slips into the tub with her back towards Blossom.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Damn."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Thanks." <span class='c4'>Ir reaches over the edge of the tub and taps the box open, then removes the waxy substance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "You been in here with Eikichi yet?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She leans her head back so she can see Blossom and grins.</span> "Seems like it could seat two."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She offers the managers the option of cooking for the whole building. Do they accept?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>It takes them a moment to determine that this isn't some kind of deliberate social trap, but no one in the River Province is going to turn down free real estate.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir steps into the kitchen and runs it like a boss. The eggs come out every five minutes like clockwork, distributed evenly amongst the guests and then the staff.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The funerary official winces slightly, but doesn't look as though they've been made to reconsider. </span>"Well... yes, we know.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Once the cooking is done, Ir emerges from the back with a two-foot-long peppermill in hand, and walks around the common room peppering the eggs to taste.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>To Eikichi:</span> "I can prep the Heavensward to go either way. We could give it a night, and if there's nothing, we could move on."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Then it's off to the Heavensward with Errant to make good on what she said.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi staggers back up to his bed, and at the foot of it sees the three bags, two that contain gifts and one that, uh, used to. Oh well, they can roll exterminator fees into whatever financial support they're offering. The two still-intact bags that </span><span class='u c10'>aren't</span><span class='c10'> covered in slime end up on Blossom's bed before Eikichi crashes for another couple of hours.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Eh? What're these?</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>This is a tricky problem... but, thankfully, the necropolis is a proper necropolis, one in which no expense was spared.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>The smaller bag holds a pendant, white and yellow gold covered in age-smudged ideograms. A symbol of the sun recovered from some old ruin, with hundreds of marks on them. Blossom'll recognize that this is some dialect of Old Realm or other, but the meaning of the marks might take some effort to puzzle out.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's very careful, especially when it comes to other people's ships.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>The larger bag holds a fine wooden box, which contains three pieces of shaped Western tree rubber resting on felt. Two of them are cylindrical - Blossom finds that they fit nicely in the palms of her hands. The third is shaped like a crescent.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>How sweet! Oh no, Blossom needs to start making gifts for the others...</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>She shakes one of the bags dubiously. </span>"Are they... special beetles?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Will the rest of the circle simply hike their way up and meet Ir at the Heavensward?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi probably won't wake up naturally on his own until after dark, but other than that, yeah!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well, they won't meet her by the Heavensward. That's the whole point of hiding the damn thing.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She's not particularly hard to find, though.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Yeah, Blossom can ask Eikichi what the deal is when they're done with work.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>So will you first meet together prior to or post-sunset, and what'll you do? You've been told the locations of all the known recent break-ins/corpse thefts, if that helps.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Any pattern?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Hopefully Blossom wakes Eikichi up a bit early so they can meet before sunset. They probably want to scope all this out before they lose the Sun.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Good question. You pore over the notes...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>...yes, there's a definite pattern here, Eikichi can elucidate.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "The grave robbery sites are just a mishmash that doesn't mean anything... from this angle." <span class='c10'>Eikichi rotates the map 90 degrees. </span>"Can anyone see what our thieves are drawing now?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir doesn't bother glancing over. He's flirting with Blossom anyway.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom: </span>"Hmm."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Don't say goodbye to me / Describe the sky to me / And if the sky falls, mark my words / We'll catch mockingbirds."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>They're loathe to give you any of the details, unfortunately.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>That depends on whether Blossom gets a response.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Blossom doesn't receive a response for several hours, but she </span><span class='u c12'>does</span><span class='c12'> get one.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>No further word, though. Who knows how long it could take to check, or if there's anything to find?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>We agreed to give them one night. Let's just stake the damn tomb out and see what happens.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The next time the mortician comes by, Ir corners him alone over near some mausoleum from a few hundred years before.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Agreed, a stakeout.</span></p>

If she's doing this without the Sun's plate, she'll do it with her most familiar arm.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The great necropolis of sijan isn't exactly a wilderness, but a lot of the principles of hunting in, say, craggy mountains can easily be made to apply here when it comes to finding sight lines, covering positions, and quietly settling in for the long wit. Blossom's able to find the Circle a somewhat uncomfortable but completely circumspect perch atop the tomb of some rich merchant, </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>one that blocks sight of she and her fellows with statues of of the province's river gods.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Attuning herself to the spirits, Blossom's increasingly certain that she's come to the right place - or, at least, that Eikichi's found some separate weird thing to investigate. There are lots of ghosts up here in the necropolis, shuffling through the streets and alleyways, sitting or praying at their own or others' tombs, examining or exchanging trade goods. Some of them see you </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>and follow you for a time; others are so vibrant that even the other members of the Circle catch glimpses.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>But tonight, many of the unquiet dead look antsy, shifty, paranoid. They keep eyeing the sky fearfully or staying close to walls and tight alleyways. Around the tomb of the old general that you're staking out right now, almost none are in evidence - they're either all avoiding it, or those that would normally be present have been sealed or banished or something.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Eikichi and Ir, meanwhile, spot something of note in the world of the living: one of the living.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>You see, there hasn't been so much as a rat up here for all the hours you've been prowling around or sitting still and watching.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>But, its shell glinting in the moonlight, a large bug of some kind - a beetle, maybe - has come crawling across the paviliion and up the door of the tomb. As you watch, it wriggles and pushes and struggles until it's squeezed itself through the crack between door and wall to disappear into the structure.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Oh Gods. It's not one of-</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir steps away from the statue and stretches.</span> "Works for me."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Yeah but Eikichi's butt hurts sitting on this statue.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir goes over everything she learned from the mortician with Blossom, Eikichi, and Ying a second time. Just to be sure.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She hands over the jade talent for the door, too.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, if you want to gain entrance, you're to press your slip of white jade against the exact center of the door with the palm of your right hand, and then splay your left palm across the tips of your right hand's fingers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>By instinct, Eikichi lets Blossom handle the jade.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir hangs back from the others as they approach the tomb, finds a tall headstone to put her back against, and slides down to wait.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She's no more than forty paces from the tomb's entrance, and anyone who walks out will see her waiting for them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Alright, Blossom presses the slip against the door as instructed.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Nothing happens for a full minute, but that's how it's supposed to go - the activation's low-key, meant to deter and discourage. There's a faint vibration under Blossom's hands then, and finally the portal slowly grinds open - it doesn't swing in or out, but sinks into the floor.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>You're given to notice, as it moves, that it's totally flush with its frame... except for a little spot on the right side that's been a teensy bit eroded or chipped or something. Guess that's how the bug got in.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>How recent is that?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Good question-</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>To Sondok:</span> "Anything special about tomb robbers?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, the tomb extends before you. There's all kinds of jade inlay in the walls, and you can only see that by virtue of the moonlight behind you and any torches or caste marks you've chosen to light your path with because it's otherwise pitch black. It is, you're well aware, a hellish maze in which one wrong step will get you incinerated, electrocuted, or bisected by gigantic hidden </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Some of the occupants of the room turn to look. They can see: a large room, quite unadorned, with cheap linoleum floors and bare white walls. In the center of the floor is about forty or so metal folding chairs. Half of them have occupants. They seem…a bit off. There’s a…man? With a grinning skeleton’s skull where his head should be. He nods politely. A woman with huge, rough stitches traveling up and down her neck and </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> face, dressed in a nice business suit. A huge wolf, its head wreathed in mist and smoke, laying down to the side of the chairs. A man that seems to be a large number of rats in a jacket. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It's real, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> At the front of the room, another man stands in front of them, his hands raised and his fingers extending and bending, like a composer.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The skull-guy makes a clacking noise that might be laughter, and turns back, raising his hand. The faceless man’s last extended finger lowers. From the…well, somewhere, a man’s voice comes out through speakers. “The bidding on this item has ended.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ peers into the people around her, and sees…not much. They all seem to have their energies hugged close. Except the manager’s assistant at the front, who doesn’t make any effort at all to conceal hers. Her black aura seems to regularly shift to a lighter gray before darkening back, and both are shot through with a galaxy of sparkling, glittering shimmers. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cavanaugh in the chair moves. Or rather, his mouth opens in a silent scream. He doesn’t say anything, though. His eyes seem to be narrowed in anger. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion_&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav takes a few steps back. He's trying to keep his eyes on these...dolls? Mannequins? While he looks for a way out.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The disemodied voice sounds again. “Welcome to the new arrivals. Our next item is the collected journals of the mage known professionally as Phocas. The bid will begin at a small portion of your love for yourself.” A small murmur runs through the audience. They seem to be slightly embarrassed. The faceless man raises a hand, and a card table with some leather-bound books seems to slowly materialize on the cleared stage. His </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> hands raise, and the fingers are all extended. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Bidding on this item has begun.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> In every direction he looks, Cav can only see the endless red fields. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The young woman raises her hand repeatedly. The faceless man ignores her. No one else bids. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Bidding on this item has ended.” The young woman looks like she’s heard this before. She seems to shrink, and takes her place beside the faceless man once more. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The roar of the fans seems to rise once more. Cavanaugh in the chair turns his head from side to side. Cav can see his eyes more clearly now - small dark irises in enormous yellow pupils. They are blazing blanknesses. He can feel things from them. Rage. Insanity. The smell of blood is very strong here. Cavanaugh’s eyes seem to glitter in the dim light of the red sun. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cavanaugh speaks. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “It is strange,” he says, “that the eye can love what the mind and body hate.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She glances at Ying. Might be time to get Tatsuya out of his semi-retirement. To what degree is this place Guild-owned?</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Swan: </span>"The upshot is, I may be guilty of nothing more than obstructing the Council's justice... and already have served my sentence. But I can't be sure."</p>

He's lost a great deal of blood, and Eikichi and Ying deduce that the damage to his torso goes deep enough past the skin that some of Swan's viscera might be molten and tangled to the point of being inoperative. If he doesn't improve, </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>or worsens, in the next day or so it might mean he needs surgery.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir will tolerate his bullshit, and watch the crowd.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>What's up when they reach the place where it all went down?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Having marked the time that the biggest-name match today will be ending, and figured out who they need to talk to if they want to enter someone into the games (or enter themselves), Ir and Eikichi move on through the city to the scene of the crime, as it were.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>direction when you start running into unusually large numbers of street cleaners, masons, painters, etc.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Actually investigating the Emissary's handiwork is a longstanding Nexus taboo, so Eikichi and Ir don't actually have to worry about too much competition when it comes to scouring the scene. They </span><span class='u c12'>will</span><span class='c12'> have to worry about the effects of repair and foot traffic, though.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Seen from on foot, the area in question seems to be - to have been - a market square. Wide, joined by multiple avenues, surrounded by banks and storefronts and food shops. Lots of bustling stalls, and a wide area in the middle that's currently basically empty but which probably held more stalls or maybe platforms or a big tent or something like that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Time to start looking around.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The ravages of magical combat are still visible along what's left of the cobblestones and in the various burn marks, craters, and cracks running through the facades all around the market square, of course. At a glance, it's clear that immense force and elemental power of various kinds was loosed here... followed by, obviously, a great tide of soot and gore.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>They managed to scrub that latter bit out yet?</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Quite probably something does. Ir and Eikichi will have to look around...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Sounds like we'll do just that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Swan: </span>"Everything about Thorns, really. It's ruled by a psychotic monster, and there's no indication he'll stop at one city.

So it gets confusing after that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>At least there's something all the merchants and passers-by are willing to agree on: clean up crew was Council's own.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The serpent cuts a path through the dusty ground into the brush.

The pressure builds on her like the heat of a day in Zoatham.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> And then the smoke evaporates, the pressure breaks, and Xia Lan is alone, in an empty storefront in an abandoned building. She's standing over an ash-streaked counter in front of a pane of glass that catches the glare from the lanterns outside like a mirror. She needs to hold it up to see the music.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>She reads it eagerly, wishing to internalize that which she bargained for.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> It's got a lot of verses and sort of a marching beat. It's a simple song; the sort you lead people in instead of performing at recital. Xia can read the entire thing if she looks closely, but the last verse is the least faded:</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='i '>He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='i '>He is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> On the back of the frame is a note with a name and an address:</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The address is a bookshop in the Firewander district. The name is "Vladok".</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>She hums the song to herself quietly in the abandoned shop. Mouthing the words, guessing at the ones that are completely lost - she'll have to retranslate it, perhaps... She doesn't even think to question whether it was worth it as she strides out of what used to be Bamaz the Bookbinder's shop, on her way to arrange passage to Nexus. A debt must be repaid, after all.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Then they probably had a more efficient and less expensive experience than Amtrak, which is the only line servicing the route down to San Diego’s Old Town, where they’ll meet people from the Embassy. At least their tickets were free. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Even east coast Amtrak's a better experience than west coast Amtrak.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will choose a seat in the quiet car and spend most of the ride texting Kay and the office.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Nix that. He'll be bringing the Bry/ians down with him.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He's annoyed that it's a work trip. Cav really would have preferred to be coming down here with her instead.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> At the San Juan Capistrano station, the late hour has cleared out most visitors to the old city’s historic downtown. The last tourists are headed home as you get there, pulling jackets on as the temperature dips below 65. The station itself is little more than a low brick structure and more brick arches next to a long platform of pink cobblestone. Palm trees line the little lane, and the train, starting with the massive block </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> of an engine, is idling under the boughs of a massive pepper tree. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Who sees them off? At least it’s much more romantic a setting than being dropped off at an airport terminal. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>You get what you pay for. KJ wrinkled her nose at the complementary ticket, but it's better than driving through enemy territory..</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav will have already said his farewells to Kay (she's keeping a night schedule at the moment, but he's still trying to keep a wall between his work and their relationship).</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>(Everyone stays healthier that way.)</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She arrives at the station with one gofer, a colourless young woman in a tracksuit who's juggling a briefcase, KJ's suitcase, and her smaller own.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Ambassador’s office has reassured them that it’s perfectly safe. No one on either side has ever attacked a train. Some things are more useful as neutral ground. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav glances at the woman with a raised eyebrow before turning to KJ. Rush and Buchanon are probably standing off a bit, talking amongst themselves or on the phone. If either of those two has significant others or family they want to bring, Cav will have bought tickets through the office for them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Zelda, this is the Baron of Laguna Beach, Shepherd of Crook and Cross, protector-emeritus of the Orange Territory that was. Cav, Zelda Essos."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Neither do. Also, the only email they’ve gotten from the actual Ambassador and not her staff has assured them that they can treat it as a vacation in all but name. In fact, there were a lot of smiley emojis put in her letter to emphasize this. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Zelda says nothing but makes the correct degree of bow. The Baron of Laguna Etcetera might catch an unguarded appraising look - at his mouth. Everything about her screams 'blood addict'.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav smiles.</span> "Good evening, Zelda." <span class='c4'>To KJ:</span> "Good evening, Baron Anaheim. You've met my retainers, Bryan Rush and Brian Buchanon."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>At the very least they crossed paths in the aftermath of the incident at Cav's office.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Yeah, good to work with you more visibly. Did all those smileys render properly for you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>(That second sentence was to Cav, though really she never looked at the staff properly anyway.)</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "I keep my fonts up to date."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "I'm not sure the degree to which I trust that this is a vacation for us, but here we are."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"It's one of those things. We're leaving responsibilities behind, which is the same as shirking them." KJ thinks of the email sitting behind a screensaver in her secure room, unsent. She watches the platform for the coming train.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Oh, we don't leave anything behind. Not anymore. That's not the kind of job this is."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He sighs.</span> "Hopefully the neighborhood won't explode while we're out."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Do you know anything fun to do in San Diego?" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The ghoul Essos fades into the foreground. While she's standing still it's hard to pick her out from the potted plants that line the inner wall of the old station.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "I always wanted to catch a baseball game at PetCo Park, but I think that possibility's been rather firmly removed from the list of options."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As the three barons’ staffs mingle, waiting for the conductor to call all aboard, KJ sees someone through the window of a nearby cafe, sitting on a bench inside, waiting. Presbyter Vincent technically administers this territory for the Church, but her offices aren’t in San Juan Capistrano. Is she waiting for someone? Or taking a train? Either way, she’s taken pains to not be seen on the platform. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "San Diego's not really a nightlife city."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> "From my understanding, at least."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"For a couple of weeks, it will be. If you're as good as I am." <span class='c6'>Or if Wilson is, but that seems unlikely.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “All aboard!” They can hear the sudden whuff of the engines cycling up, and their few fellow passengers start lining up and stepping in. As they do, every ghoul’s phone buzzes with an email notification. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She doesn't draw any attention to the priest, but makes sure to stand somewhere where Clara Vincent can see </span><span class='b c6'>her</span><span class='c6'> - deliberately enough that a watcher watching themselves watched will be aware of the watched's watch. It's arguably a form of respect.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Clarabelle waves when she sees KJ seeing her. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rush and Buchanan both dutifully forward it to Cav; it’s from the Seneschal. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav follows KJ's eye line back to the Presbyter, and when she waves, Cav will nod in her direction and smile. To KJ, without looking away from Vincent:</span> "Ah. The church will be joining us after all."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> RE: Travel</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Oh, it's the really friendly one. Might as well smile back and hope nobody mentioned that she's never got around to going to the Carmelite church despite all the invitations.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav glances at his phone.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Zelda Essos doesn't need to forward anything to KJ - everything that hits her ghouls' inboxes is bounced to her own as a matter of course. Both women read it looking for things of quite different relevance.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> To All Staffs: The Prince has left the city to attend to some urgent trade business abroad. This is not a license for any change in behavior or non-observance of established law. Any opportunists will be dealt with harshly. A formal message will be drafted shortly.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav grimaces and resists the urge to shake his head. In New York no one would have known about something like this until after the Prince had returned. But then, the climate in New York is much different than it is in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>For instance, his last update on New York politics was Holymount's psuedo-sad notification that the other senior partners had been murdered while travelling.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> With their belongings secured, the train blows its whistle and pulls out of the station. Within a few minutes, they’re clear of San Juan Capistrano and on the coastal track, the ocean on their right and the pitch-black foothills to their left. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ doesn't comment directly. </span>"Have they got us sharing cabins? I'm in.. how do you read this thing.."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There’s hardly anyone else on the train with them at this time of night. The barons can sit pretty much wherever they like, once the conductors make their initial passes. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The Amtrak that Cav is used to has general, self-selected seating with a quiet car in the front. But it depends if their benefactors have sprung for first class or not.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> They have not. The quiet car is off-limits to coach passengers, sadly. There’s a website where they can use the Amtrak app to upgrade on the spot, but if you try to go on their website to download it, their servers appear to be down. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Annoying.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Talking it is, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Look, KJ wasn't sure whether to expect the bus-like BART style squalor or the freaking, orient express here?

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The train softly trundles down the coast track. They can see the San Clemente Pier now, the track running just behind the public beach. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Well, the Court chose to send Barons who - between us - accounted for at least fifteen dead on the other side. Are you <span class='i '>sure</span> it's all good for now?"</p>

Honestly, it’s the whole San Diego thing, you know. You’re doing them a favor, really, dying in glorious battle, you know. They won’t say it, but some of these elders like portraits of dead children more than the living thing. As long as you did it wearing armor, face to face, I can’t imagine they’ll try anything. Now, they might give you a nasty look or two. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> But all’s fair in love and war, etcetera…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Haha. Yeah. Wearing armor.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well, it was face-to-face at least.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby: “Now, I was in San Francisco at the time, so I guess the principle only goes so far - oh, well, I’m sure the Princess has a spare driver for you. If you want to stretch your legs on your own, we’ve got our own exclusive cab contract. I’ll send you the number. Service all hours, anywhere in the county. Tip well, though. They drive faster that way. The trolleys are cute little things, but it’s only around downtown.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Plus, you know what a pain in the ass sticking to a schedule is, especially when you just want to relax.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Indeed." <span class='c4'>He still hasn't installed Uber, mainly out of petulance -- it feels like a full third of the e-mails on the Shepherds listserv are various complaints about NYC cabs, and pining for Uber to replace them permanently -- and is glad he still doesn't have to even without his Lexus.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> True to Abby’s prediction, they can see a fully-uniformed chaffeur, brass buttons running down the front of his jacket, waiting at a respectful distance for them. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She definitely looks uncomfortable. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She looks around for him. “But besides that…how many other Nosferatu are with you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion|&gt;</span> "It's just the Baron Hollywood, I believe. But they come and go. You know how Obfuscate can be."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby shakes her head. “Damn local customs. Funny thing about our little social circle. You get so used to complaining about how Marquis Figueroa is, or how stuffy all our sires can be, and you forget that they’re the ones with enough foresight to leave places like this and try new things.” She waves her aide forward. He comes, bringing a suitcase. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Now, understand, I think it’s a barbaric custom. But you may want to observe them for your own safety and comfort.” The aide opens the suitcase. Inside, are the two white, featureless, porcelain masks, on a red silk pillow. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>This job is turning out to be suspiciously like work.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>08:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>At least it's work with fairly interesting stakes. Blossom, for instance, becomes increasingly aware of the kind of hideous health disaster that her perspicuous tracking and judicious application of cleansing fire is averting.

Through turning up nigh-invisible scuff marks where a body was been dragged into the river, tiny splotches of blood and damp, and watching the stains showing high tide, she tracks down the corpse that got away. A few swift gouts of flame see to the cocoon and the larvae, and then </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>a brief touch on a withered forehead turns the corpse into fading motes of light.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The three find a few people on the brink of death, shivering and withering in their own dwellings.

The high walls have been festooned with banners representing the Guild, the city, the grand arena, and five or six dozen different businesses and conglomerates and brand names and whatever else. The gates, normally wide open, have been sealed tightly </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>shut - those wishing to enter the city will have to use the smaller doors set into the wall at regular intervals throughout the Bastion district.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>The announcement's to be made at noon, but crowds have started to amass since before sunup. With them, of course, is the usual flotilla of concession stands, souvenir shops, food carts, and of course official arena ticket sellers. There are plenty of different matches to which tickets are being sold, Wild Rose's next bout among them, but the really big deal is the MYSTERY MATCH, ??? </span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>She does, but not for lack of trying on the Guild's part. Blossom was shrewd enough to catch that one, fortunately.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>That's very wise, although, if the Guild gets their way in the next few Council meetings, highly illegal.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Well, it's not illegal yet. Fair game!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>At any rate, the Squared Circle's wagon is just one of many in the streets of Nexus that morning. It's perhaps distinguished by the fact that it's pulled by a pair of hearty emas birds rather than cheaper and less reliable horses, but enough of the wealthy are at least intrigued by the arena's massive ad campaign that it doesn't render you an object of serious suspicion.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Maybe the way other wagons or crowd goers part for you as you approach the central plaza - either willingly or because they've been rudely pushed aside by guards and other facilitators - is unusual, but, hell, the Guild does all sorts of quiet boring logistical stuff.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, everyone's attention is on the other side of the square. Specifically, on the great gates, which keep shaking.</span></p>

An announcer, his voice magically amplified by a twisted, coral-encrusted seashell he's speaking into from a podium on the far side of the square, is doing his absolute best to heighten expectations and concentrate adrenaline - it's </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>coming! No... THEY'RE coming! Something great! Something terrible! Could it be the deadliest threat this city's faced yet?!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>I'm assuming the Squared Circle split up once they hit the Plaza - Eikichi and Ying to someplace with a nice view, Blossom and Ir hidden from sight on the other side of the square from the rumbling gates.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>That's easily arranged. If need be, Ying and Eikichi could've benefited from some VIP treatment, and had a way made for them to the very front of the crowd or even into some high seats.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Anyway, the mood of the crowd is reaching a fever pitch. They're shouting at the announcer and at each other, desperately buying event tickets before - upon the revelation of the actual fighters - the price goes up, scarfing down sausages-in-buns and cups of shaved ice... and then the sun reaches its zenith and the gates explode open.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>I do mean explode; there's a flash of fire behind them, and the great wood-and-metal doors are smoking as the whip around on their hinges and slam into the wall. Barreling in through them, completely unfettered, is a pair of enormous tyrant lizards!</span></p>

The two creatures have near-identical builds and scales, down to their brow ridges and spinal bumps and so on, and each has the same tiger stripe pattern running down its length, but they're of complementary rather than identical colors. One's a deep orange, and one's an ashen, purplish grey.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi's hooting and hollering.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Astute observers will note that while these lumbering monsters are </span><span class='i c12'>literally</span><span class='c12'> unfettered, that may not be the metaphorical case; there's a small encampment of wagons and guards and observers and so on behind them, on the other side of the gates, and they don't appear to have been eaten or incinerated or something.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Ying's a little more reserved than Eikichi, but he's right. He's right! Dinosaurs are awesome!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>In particular, a lanky and lightly-dressed southerner seems to be keeping himself within some twenty or thirty yards behind them, the air around him rippling as he stares at them hard.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>At the signal, Blossom takes the smoke bombs she begged from Ying days ago out of a small sack and tosses them!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>While the crowd's attention was elsewhere, one last banner was hoisted up behind a dais right before Ir's wagon - it's a field of solid color across which points a silver spear.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>There are no storm clouds in the sky, no hint of rain, but a blue lightning bolt streaks down from the sky with a CRASSSH, briefly illuminating the smoke clouds with a coruscating blue!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>In Blossom's hands now is a zither that any musician would recognize as a masterwork.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Then the smokecloud ripples and explodes away, torn apart by a burning pillar of sunlight that drives up into the heavens.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Soon, the limo pulls out of the parking lot and into the freeway. They can see the huge, dark bays again as they head to the northwest. Eventually, the suburbs thin out. The driver pulls off onto the side streets after a while, and they can see the roads begin to be lined with huge cypresses and oaks. The houses here seem to be bigger and further apart. As they drive, it’s hard to get much of a look around because of the </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> winding nature of the hills surrounding them. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The limo clears one last estate’s gate as they turn onto a series of switchbacks, and then they’re in the clear, the brush around them stretching away into darkness. The intercom cracks: “Just a few more minutes until we arrive.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The car pulls up to a large iron gate, waiting only for a moment as it parts. Once inside, the land around them levels off, plateauing for at least a mile in each direction. As they drive through, the landscape changes from rough chapparal to manicured lawns, fields, hedges, and garden plots. They can see statues and fountains, occasionally. If they roll the windows down, the smell of lavender will come to their noses, and </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> they’ll realize that the main causewway is flanked on both sides by half-acres of the flowers. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>In the language of flowers.. that means shit just got real.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Too much land.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Eventually, the limo stops in a large gravel driveway. The land here is cupped like an ampitheater, the gardens and fields leading down to a central estate of many wings and an ornate architecture. A huge staircase dominates the front, and the driveway is lined with servants and helpers. Beyond, the land curves so that the entirety of La Jolla is exposed to their view; a huge, glittering semi-circle stretching to either side of </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> the horizon bounded only by the black ocean beyond. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>That's definitely what you picture when you picture 'the home of the Princess La Jolla'.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> When the limo pulls up, they can see that the entrance staircase has been decorated with wreaths of flowers and reams of white silk ribbons. A hand-painted wooden sign reads: WELCOME HONORED GUESTS. As soon as the engine turns off, servants are taking their luggage discreetly around the back. On the staircase are two women, one dressed in a black dress, white collar, and top hat, the other in an extremely comfortable looking </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> ballroom dress of white silk with flowers pinned to its sides. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's on board so far.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Weird, beautiful henchmen does seem to be his wheelhouse.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Let's see if the Princess has any mountain lions, though.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> A trumpet player lets loose a blast from a balcony. The announcement afterwards is in Spanish. “Presenting, for the pleasure of the Princess La Jolla Elena Solano y Medina: Wilson Frost, Baron of Hollywood. Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna Beach. K.J. Valentine, Baron of Anaheim.” The servants applaud after each name. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> How seriously do the three of them take it? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Quite.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>What's that old saying, it doesn't matter if you believe in God, but if God believes in you?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Wait. Maybe that was from a Disney movie.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Point is: not gonna be rude to a host with this much pull.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson pulls off the sarape with a clank. He's wearing a burnished gray breastplate over the puffy vest. He was wearing it, in retrospect, the entire time. Beneath the sombrero he's got a misshapen and alarmed-looking golden mask.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>You don't waste a good spotlight. KJ sets the now-gauche serape aside as she steps out of the limo and stands for a moment with her hands in her pockets watching the top of the stairs; she bows once her name's called and starts upward to be presented for the pleasure of the Princess.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> http://i.imgur.com/tJ8ysve.jpg</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson slides out of the limo and bows at the announcement, going up the stairs afterwards.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She doesn’t look particularly fearsome, anyway. The Princess, as the one in the white silk dress appears to be, waits for them to ascend to the second level of the staircase, inclining her head as they each make it up. A mastiff sits in a relaxed manner by the feet of the woman in a top hat. After they all arrive, the latter speaks first, in a surprising rasp. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Greetings, honored guests. We are honored to host friends of our family. I am Dona Eva de la Campa, the Princess’s second. I trust you have all traveled and arrived without incident? One small matter - do any of you not speak Spanish? We will assign you help fluent in the language of your choosing during your stay here.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav indicates he's fine in Spanish, even though his player isn't.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson doesn't indicate he needs help with Spanish.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"My Spanish is poor, Dona. I've only brought one assistant, so thank you very much for the consideration."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Dona Eva keeps it in English, then. “Of course. We are delighted to help the envoys of the Princess’s brother-in-law in any way we can.” Another trumpet blast sounds from somewhere on a balcony. “Elena Ignacia Figueroa de Solano y Medina, Princess La Jolla.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Princess puts out a small hand, palm down. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson takes her hand gently and bows.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav's bow has a bit more of a flourish to it, but basically the same thing.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ takes the princess's hand and bows in turn. She's not dressed for a curtsy.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>What's her aura like, though?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She doesn’t make any effort to hide her emotional state. It’s a cloud of light blue with whorls of pink and lavender. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Princess waits patiently until the formalities have been observed. Then: “Baron Frost, I do not endorse the backwards custom of Nosferatu masking themselves. Please do not imagine that anything except your own comfort may demand that you wear one in this house.” She draws a shawl around her shoulders. “Chilly, isn’t it? Let’s go into the atrium. Eva, could you have everything brought to us there?” Her English has</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> no discernible accent, and leads them further into the house as she speaks. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Oh, whew. Wilson takes the mask off.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav, murmuring:</span> "Guess that means no stilts."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Quickly, they pass through a grand entry hall with black and white marble floors, heavy wooden furniture, and stone busts of distinguished ancestors. Through a set of double doors, she stops them in a large enclosed garden, walled off with glass and wrought-iron transparent sliding doors. The space is filled with beds of flowers, comfortable looking chairs, overhanging oak boughs, and the sound of running water from several </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> fountains. Above, there is no roof. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Nice.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Eva reappears flanked by servants holding silver plates full of hors d’oeuvres, placed on a nearby table, and flutes of champagne. Discreetly, small cards with the wine list printed on them are pressed into your hands. The Princess sits you all in a circle, a flat stone table between you. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Ehhh. He shouldn't.</span></p>

Well, just this once. </span>"I'm already impressed,"<span class='c6'> says KJ as the pallor fades from her skin. </span>"We're further from smog than you can get within the Brilliant Court's limits."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> After the servants have left, Eva takes a seat by herself on a fountain’s stone base. The Princess sips champagne slowly. “We have blood, as well, of course. Though I ask that you imbibe privately.” She rests her elbow on a pillow and leans forward. “So. I imagine that traveling to a foreign city, while your Prince leaves the city and your enemies remain free to plot against you, has made this assignment more stressful </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> than you would like.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav grimaces.</span> "I'm sure at least in my case the Court feels the vacation is mutual."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Could be worse. It could have been a less beautiful city."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson: </span>"I'm enjoying myself immensely."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>This is not entirely true, nor would it be the way he'd present the matter in discussion with said enemies.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I’m very glad to hear it. I hope that I can provide you with some peace of mind that you would not usually find during your stay here.” She looks at Cav. “I’m not so sure. A Shepherd is useful to have as a friend and servant. And as your distance from your master increases, so your utility to him decreases. Of course, it’s been a long time since I knew a Shepherd.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He smiles.</span> "So our kind made down here, too, have we?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Or perhaps La Jolla flies around the world. It certainly looks like it could.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Decades ago. A man named Peter Holymount.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The smile stays just as smooth and charming.</span> "He's my grandsire."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "We have a working relationship," <span class='c4'>Cav said.</span> "Peter likes to say it's his policy not to fraternize with the junior associates."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She cannot read the intention behind the careful phrasing. “We had our differences of opinion. I knew your sire as well, Baron Frost. Though, we only met a few times.” She sips her champagne. “My apologies, Baron Valentine. I don’t mean to make it seem as if you are less pedigreed by comparison.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Though I hardly consider pedigree a merit. It is less than useless, most of the time.” </p>

The tall figures, so tall that Cav thought they must be wearing stilts, dressed in black robes. In the night’s coastal mist, their white porcelain masks make them look even more ghostly.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> La Jolla: “You will be given a duplicate set of papers.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> La Jolla puts down the dart she was about to throw at a wall of balloons. “The war is ongoing.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Princess shifts her coat with a shrug of her shoulders. “Things are accelerating in San Diego.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It’s as if the shadow of something overhead passes over the figure, and her mind leaves him for a second to try and see it.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Princess smiles. “Good. I’ll have the plans sent to your room.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The limousine takes them away from the beach and the carnival, back up into the hills and the grand estate. The rest of the night, the barons are left to their own devices in palatial guest houses. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Two nights later, the three Barons are told to dress in armor and report to the palace’s driveway. The drive to Miramar takes about an hour and a half, far past the lights of downtown, far into the endless hill and canyons of San Diego County. There are fewer trees than the wilds of back home down here…until they reach a small, wealthy community near a lake. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The lake is fringed with willows, elms, and cypresses, obscuring dozens of grand manors and modern palaces. At the far end, something incredible stands illuminated. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rising from the edge of the waters is a huge castle-manor, its turrets and towers bristling with miniature battlements, constructed out of gleaming white marble. Searchlights illuminate its surface, and from the other side of the lake they can see swarms of people milling about in its great courtyard. From its highest tower, they can hear bells chime to mark midnight. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Princess La Jolla descends from a truck, armored in a deep scarlet plate. Eva’s is a pale yellow.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> A fleet of rowboats takes you all across the water, the retainers doing the pulling, undead physiques keeping their manicured appearances perfectly still.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As the boats make their way past a short jetty and pull up next to a launch and staircase, a trumpeter sounds a high note from a balcony. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> You hear someone cry out above the noise: “Arriving, Elena Ignacia Figueroa de Solano y Medina, Princess La Jolla! Her retinue!” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> It's before lunchtime, on one of those early spring days where it rains in fits. There's a lot of weather like that in this part of the Threshold. The clouds are tinged red by the star they obscure, and people are still talking about all the bad news that keeps trickling in: the fall of Thon, the mysterious absence of Council proclamations, the increasing visibility of Lookshyan soldiers </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> in the city, the honey and its prisoners, and of course, the death of the Emissary.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Lookshy. An ironic name, really.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Stranger woke up this morning to the sound of a steady drip-drip-drip on the polished stone floor of the hideout. There's a leak somewhere, hard to see and hard to patch because the place is earthenwork.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Unhelpful, too, that Xu Sim's experiments are so...active.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Guild guildhouses tend to hang their shingles in Nexus's prosperous and fast-moving downtown.

Higher-end (and more expensive) contractors set up in the rich neighborhoods flanking Parko Llana while humbler folk work in the neighborhoods at the foot of Sentinel </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Hill.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Chosen craftsmen (which is to say, almost exclusively, dragonblooded craftsmen) virtually all work for the Guild, and the ones that don't tend to head private practices downtown. But you never know. You can find anything in Nexus, so they say.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Humility is a virtue -- but an even better virtue is its closest brother, discretion.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger will start in Sentinel Hill, then move on to Parko Llana and, if absolutely necessary, finally venture downtown.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Stranger spends a fair bit of the day, into the afternoon, looking around for people who might be amenable to his work. It's an all-but-impossible needle to thread, though: people in the working-class neighborhoods hate the Guild and the Anathema both, people in the richer neighborhoods don't mind Anathema but Stranger realizes most of them are angling to get bought out by the Guild, </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> and the contractors downtown hate the Guild fiercely, don't care about Anathema, but wouldn't be caught dead in Floodwater.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>So it goes. But the search is worth it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Downtown is where he finds his best lead, from the apprentice working under a stern Earth Aspect master mason who's been tapped to screen prospective clients. How oblique is Stranger about his parameters? Would a socially inept teen be able to tell that Stranger wanted someone who didn't want to sell out, wasn't repulsed by the poor, and isn't frightened by the risk of association with </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Anathema when there's a Wyld Hunt in town?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>That depends on how trustworthy and virtuous Stranger finds the teen.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> He seems too earnest and frankly dense to be duplicitous. Stranger sees him thumbing a locket stuck on the end of prayer beads. It only takes a brief conversation to identify him as a mama's boy, gone into the workforce out of necessity because his father passed. Not the kind of worker Stranger's after, but, the kind of kid Stranger can trust won't fuck him over.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Then he is more than willing to be as indiscreet as necessarily up to just before the point of actually saying the word 'Anathema,' or identifying himself directly as one.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The boy: "Oh, no, sorry. I don't think I can help you. That's quite a conundrum, sir." A half-grin, memory-spurred. "I guess there's always Old Selin. If you can find him."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>That raises an eyebrow. Selin is a rather common name -- but 'old?' Old coots that have been run off for their eccentricities are far more promising than young bucks trying to make their name.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Old Selin, hmm?" <span class='c14'>Stranger pauses as if thinking about it.</span> "How old?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Oh, I don't know. Master Fahad calls him Old Selin, and Master Fahad's over a hundred."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger supresses a smile. Yes, that's old enough to almost certainly have exalted blood in him. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Say I did want to find Old Selin, then. Where would I begin?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "When Master Fahad wants to hire him, he usually goes to the River Temple around evening bell. But it's raining, so he might be in the Undercity too."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Old Selin's a bum," says the kid with the confident obliviousness of someone who doesn't realize how rude that is.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "They give out dinner at the River Temple."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Bless his heart. He's a good boy not to have opinions about bums.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger thanks him for his time and tips him, then begins planning the rest of his day.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The River Temple is a joint monument to the three river mighty river gods who make their home in Nexus, the Maiden in Yellow, Grey, and Great Yanaze. Naturally, it's built right where the rivers merge. And there's dozens of ways into the Undercity, usually at streetcar junctions or along the canals.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Ah. Grey. Memories.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>...Time to look for the soup kitchens, then.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> They're not hard to find. People ranging from the elderly to families with children eat at the temple. It's one of the bigger crowds Stranger's seen since coming to Nexus. Rare for so many people to mill around in one spot.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> It's not quite evening bell yet, so people <span class='u '>are</span> standing around, or sitting around. There's talking, and laughing, and some music, a couple scuffles, and a whole lot of quietly looking up at the temple waiting for the bells to chime.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Big tureens are being set up under awnings on the temple steps, and there are huge lidded baskets lining the square in some effort to corral the trash.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The rain's thinning out. What's Stranger's approach?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger probably looks poor enough that he can just blend in with the lines.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> While the rain is thinning out, it <span class='u '>is</span> still raining, and you'd think that this many people, at least some of them would be exposed to the rain. But standing in line Stranger notices he's stopped getting wet. He looks up to see broad canvas sheets taut like sails, bending the wind above everyone's heads and blowing the rain into the canal, the gutters and the alleyways, and... into </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> the inexplicably open windows of the Guild bank across the street from the temple.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>A water bank?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He's heard of the concept in the South.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>But the climate here should render that, ah. Unprofitable.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> No, a regular bank. With like... papers and ink.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>How odd.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He didn't want to get involved with the Guild as such, but...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The bank's closed, so nobody's inside. Whoever opens up tomorrow is going to find the second and third floors all but ruined.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Now there's a trick.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>A bit on-the-nose, however. There will be repurcussions for the soup kitchens -- even if they're mostly petty ones.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Someone else is looking up at the bank windows, further ahead in the line. An old man in a knit cap, with a long, shaggy beard obscuring his long, thin neck.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger is now guessing that the whole 'guild-hating' thing is what got through to the young lad in his apprenticeship.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He will not approach until after the man has gotten his food, and preferably he'll hang around long enough Stranger can get his as well.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Soup kitchens can have excellent food, are noble enterprises, and he HAS spent all this time in line.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The food here is good! A lot of people knock temple food because it's free, but, those people have never had temple food. Stranger gets a bowl of some kind of vegetable stew and a piece of bread.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Now that reminds him of home.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Now that reminds him of home.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>...Gary's home, at least.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Once Stranger's gotten his food -- where's the old man?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Stranger sees the old man sitting in a circle with several other old men in the light of temple lanterns. One of them unpacks a bag of polished stones and sets them out on the ground between the men as they eat and argue.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He will walk over, then. Is there any obviously clear place to sit, if he wishes to invite himself in? And what's the deal with these stones, so he doesn't get blind-sided by some obscure riverman honor game?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The old men are spaced out enough that there's places Stranger could sit without invading anyone's personal space. It takes him a moment since there's no board underneath, but he soon realizes that those polished stones are (fairly abstract) Gateway pieces. They're talking about a board position.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Ah, Gateway. The preferred game of geniuses, real and imagined, for ages.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger has never given it much time or thought. How does the board position look?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> It's a mess. White has no good moves that Stranger can see, while Black's position is commanding. But the more he looks at it, trying to figure out how to win, the more precarious Black's position seems. Any of the obvious moves open Black up to devastating counterplay and a huge loss of material and position.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Storm's coming."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Does he pass the eye test enough to just sit down without a challenge.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> *<span class='c14'>?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I wouldn't bet on Black."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Unless Stranger's bought more expensive-looking clothes than he wore into Nexus, the only thing that'd mark him out is the sword, if he's wearing it. Humble as it is, Stranger could eat for a month off what he'd get for selling it.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He's not carrying a sword. He's carrying a cane, which they might be able to identify as splitting into a sword.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>And he hasn't washed the clothes in awhile.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Then Stranger's probably fine. He gets the sense that this is pretty informal.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He'll take a seat that's a respectful distance from the others -- not too close, not too far. What's his prospective guess at Old Selin up to? Has he already finished his stew and bread?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Old Selin eats like a bird, picking at his food slowly while he argues with the others. Everyone else is trying to figure out Black's winning move, while Old Selin picks apart their strategies by outlining counterattacks.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger is content to watch, then. He's not equipped to engage in a battle of strategic wits with the old man -- at least not at Gateway -- and he somehow doubts the man would be all too impressed by a know-it-all showing up like this anyhow.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The man Stranger suspects is Old Selin proposes a counterattack that gets the other men all conferring among themselves. This is when he notices Stranger. "Hello. It's nice to meet you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger slightly bows his head.</span> "You as well."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "A Gateway player?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Sometimes. It gets people talking."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "You?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger shakes his head.</span> "Sadly, no. It was not a respected pursuit where I grew up."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "You're never too old to learn something new."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The silver-haired man smiles.</span> "True."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Where are you from? I haven't seen you around before."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I haven't been around much. I grew up on the banks of the Grey. Merchants, we were -- fishermen, mainly, but we had our fields to tend to as well. Stiff competition. Never went hungry, but routinely went poor. Gateway was...a Guild game."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "That's the power of geography. Here, this game is one of the few things in Nexus the Guild <span class='u '>doesn't</span> own."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger nods and takes another bite of bread. When he's no longer speaking with his mouthful:</span> "This is my first time up this way, however. I've been staying in Floodwater. Getting by. Doing well enough for myself, though still between work."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I like it there."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "It's nice. Bit quiet for my taste."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger nods again.</span> "That's a good thing. When you want noise, you simply take a walk."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "True, true. What brought you out here? I hope it was the food. The food's worth it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "No, the food merely convinced me to stay. Best soup kitchen I've eaten in, and I've eaten in a few. What brought me up here was a problem I had."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Oh?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "A problem with, oh, let's say, certain gentlemen."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "They run a bank, among other things."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> The old man's mouth is full now, so he just nods for Stranger to continue.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "But they don't run Floodwater. They have very little interest in it, frankly. I'd like that to continue."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Floodwater belongs in banks. Banks don't belong in Floodwater."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Ha!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Well, that's simple enough. There's nothing to sell there, and no one to sell it to. Keep the property values down, and you'll keep away the people who care about property values."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "What's the saying? The river goes where the water flows."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "But no one knows when the Batcave closed."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He elaborates:</span> "It was a teahouse."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I'd say anyone who wanted to make life better there -- they'd have a tough balancing act to pull off."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "New, useful building, without making it attractive to..." <span class='c14'>He waves a hand in the direction of the Guild bank.</span> "You know."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Sounds like you'd want some construction work done."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The silver-haired man nods.</span> "Some. Discreetly. Good work; constant work. No money in it. Better things than money."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "A roof, a community. Food. I won't guarantee it's up to this standard, but cooked with feeling."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "And a challenge."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "You know what they say, after all."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "You're only in trouble if you get caught."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Ah."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "You represent somebody?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Myself. And Tepali, the local elder. We had a carpenter -- built a bridge, a fine bridge -- but he had to go away. Go North."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "This sounds like something we should discuss further, out of the rain. You have a place?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "That I do. Do you like tea?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "It's my only affectation."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Leaves are cheap when you grow them."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>03:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He'll perhaps wait until they're away from the group before asking that.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I think it is the only thing that changes people."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Maybe you're right. I've always thought it just makes them more themselves."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I think people will be good if you let them, and people will be bad if you make them. But many wise men see the obverse."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Still, to see this and to have your first instinct be to help them. If we're to get philosophical, we might say that the tendency of virtue is to obsolete itself, and the tendency of vice is to stand fast and multiply."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "People call me Selin. What do they call you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Trusting your first instinct is not the same thing as virtue. My first instinct was to find good tea. It could well be said to have also been my vice. And these all fit within your parameters -- but the trick, as I see it, is to enslave your vice, twist it, and then see that it multiplies.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I am Stranger-Visits-Heaven. Hopefully you know me neither by my name, nor my works. There is no such thing as good publicity."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Selin snorts. "So it goes."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "What sorts of projects are you thinking of?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Invisible things, to start with. Sewer projects. Underground works. Keep the waters down to manageable levels, but do not drain the place such that passersby might actually think of moving in to this brand new real estate. Alleviate flood season, for starters. There are very old, very ruined sluices, gates, and waterways to work with already -- high level things. A good </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> challenge, I'd think, especially if the people living there are covering for you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "After that, community housing. Community workspacing. Things that are useful to real people, but, aheh, anathema to investors -- little privacy, little individuality, little resale value. Not shiny, but built for-purpose."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Finally, and most tenuously, direct above-ground infrastructure improvements. This is the most delicate of tasks, because it is the most visible and the most likely to be seized and turned into a toll serivce."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "There are things we can do, if we've got the community behind us. But I should warn you, I can't do anything with the underlying architecture. I can redirect, I can siphon and sluice and shuffle, but the really old stuff is off-limits."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He grimaces.</span> "As much as I love fucking up the Guild's day, I'd prefer they remained too stupid to notice us."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "That's fine. Is that a council-level dictat or a mere fact of the architecture?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I try to stay as unfamiliar with Nexus law as possible. It makes me more pleasant to be around."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Closer to the former."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "I have no problems with you setting your own limits on that front, both in general and with specific reference to Council Law, but if you see an opportunity to change something that you cannot change, do not hesitate to ask me what I can do to help. Because I have the power to bend ears, when I put my will towards it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He hesitates.</span> "The last project is actually an offer, coupled with a personal request. We have a...common house in Floodwater. A hostel, if you will. For me and four other people like me. They do not all perfectly share my values, but they do not directly oppose them, and the five of us are a very potent power. I might not feel confident to make this offer alone -- but I am not </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> alone."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The offer is a room in this hostel, with everything that implies. You get a key, you pay no rent, you come and go as you please, you fend for yourself for food but the larder is usually stocked."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The request is that you plug a damnable leak we have somewhere in the upper crawlspace."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "And other minor upkeep."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Obviously, you're not a cleaner, and while I don't think any of my colleagues are so rude as to demand such, feel free to deal with any requests from them as you see fit. I'll cover for you, so long as you're not being an asshole."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Or, if you prefer the streets, or some other venue, it is yours."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "...But when you get a free moment, I would still ask for help with the leak."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> Selin considers this all. "I'll help, certainly. But I don't think I can accept your offer of lodging, though it is kind. You said there's a leak?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "Drip drip drip."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "It's a...high-intensity domicile."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "We have a sorcerer."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Ah, so that's where Xu Sim's staying."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He laughs at that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Yes. Yes it is."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Everyone seems to know Xu Sim. How very complicated it's made our lives."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "He's sharp, if inconstant. I had a friend like him a long time ago."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>04:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Stranger:</span> "His inconstancy is more boon than bust, I think. But it does make things interesting."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The sun is rising over the desert. Spreading light reveals open-cut pits in the earth, great derricks and platforms, a complex of concrete painted flaking green and surrounded by radio towers.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> All the lights at Baikonur are off but for two buildings. One is a staff canteen where the tail-end of a party emits flickers of celebration and music which drifts over the empty launchpads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_aWGakJe4</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Around the other side of a missile test range is the secondary administration building, dedicated to Interkosmos - a hypothetical dream of cooperation which has yet to find any cooperators. They use it for now as storage and for this interrogation.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There are two men from the Party, tired and ruffled by long hours of questioning. It seems to have worn more on them than their captive. In keeping with the Hegemonic Ministry's strange practices, one of them isn't even <span class='i '>mistika</span> - a mage. Otherwise there's no visible difference between them.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first man: "So you watched the rocket, without proper protective goggles. You saw its concealment from the eyes of America and God. And you say you saw.. something else, in that lack which should have been absolute."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second man: "Decreed free of information or perception."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Days later on the other side of the Iron Curtain, Cleaner gets the news from the Brigadier-Sublime.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>What time is it?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Comfortably post-prandial. You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The fuck is a--</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Mid-afternoon?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors.</span> "My people."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." <span class='c14'>Cleaner uncrosses his legs.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "So it goes."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited.</span> "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. </span>"That's all correct." <span class='c10'>Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't <span class='u '>all</span> be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>So as not to create any misperception of charity:</span> "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. </span><span class='c1'>“Sorry,”</span><span class='c13'> he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> white shirts and white shorts. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Sounds bad." <span class='c14'>Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He stands.</span> "That be all?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for <span class='u '>the</span> Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. </span>"I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> what I saw as another sun."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. </span>“Good evening.” <span class='c13'>The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. </span>"I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “So sorry. No speak English.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must <span class='i '>not</span> succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Mm. Well. She’s seen it before.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There's a hatchway to the side of the ship's rather noisy engine room which Orient hasn't seen open before. Inside is some sort of office alright- medical supplies and tins of food are stacked on shelves behind a man who is, indeed, wearing a captain's uniform. You don't recognise him, but how much attention were you paying?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Ynkblot: "I don't want his name. I want his jugulum."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient steps into the little office and nods.</span> “Captain.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Endless Depths tries to say something but he's kind of squashed behind the Thyrsus there. The night deepens.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Caveat hasn't even rolled her window down, but kind of shrugs goodbye.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's nod to them is meant for her.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> When the Impala starts up again you've got a much emptier road. The forest is dense and humid, but it's just twenty minutes before Cleaner and Henrik climb a ridge to see the sea, then the land, then the sea. On the island between the peninsular rivers is a wide expanse of roads, cleared land, military bases and little townships - and the launchpads. Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship. It's still some way to travel, but they're thirty-six stories tall and bright orange.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There are actually no chairs in the supply office. There *is* a logbook of some kind, which the uniformed sailor pulls toward him and begins writing you out a receipt. "1200," Gary informs him. Presumably that's in american 'bucks'.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient nods and pulls out his wallet, counting out $1200 in bills.</span> “And what was your name, Captain?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Call me Sam, Mr. Kapic. Have you been enjoying the cruise otherwise?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” <span class='c13'>Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk.</span> “Is this what you wanted?” <span class='c13'>he asks Sam. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Oddly, that one was <span class='i '>almost</span> true. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>13:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient turns to Gary.</span> “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It is very clear that Sam expected this.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Sorry about that, yeah?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. </span>“It’s alright, Sam.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief. I thought.." He's kicking the fallen money into a little pile behind him. "Dunno what I thought. Fucking weird that Gary turned us in, though. Don't expect another share now, Gary."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “How long have you been running this scam?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Just a couple of years since Yarmouth opened out of Port Canaveral!

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Shut up!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "It works <span class='i '>really</span> well when they don't have a visa either. The guy at the docks tells them it won't be checked at the point, and then I regret to inform them.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I really do regret it, you know?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sam, please! There’s no need for harsh language here. I imagine it works very well then, Gary. It sounds like it would work very well on very vulnerable people like that. I imagine they would be very scared.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Who are you?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> He's got the presence of mind to be standing on the cash, at least. The ship creaks and turns a little, sending pills and bits of glass across the floor.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I’m an importer-exporter, headed towards Florida to try and set up my business there. Before I decided to emigrate, I lived in Milan with my wife. Before I came to America, I was spending time with her on vacation. The nature of my work means that I won’t see her for quite some time.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Orient taps his wallet. “This was all the money I had on me. It was all I had to try and make a life for myself in America. You’ve taken about half. I don’t think my business would be able to survive on what I have left. I’m not sure what I would do if you kept it.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "That's a real shame" and obviously completely true. "Best of luck with your uh, venture. I mean we're both businessmen here in a way, right."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Sam! We can't keep it, are you nuts?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “No, we’re not both businessmen. I’m afraid that you’re trying to rationalize taking advantage of people. Do you think you’re doing that? Taking advantage of people just like you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "What, so some wop wants to start a business instead of going home to his wife and somehow that's our problem? This is America, or it will be in a couple of days."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "The business thing isn't real, that's not the point, the point is you're being a dick-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "No, obviously it is- you want to make a charitable donation to some guy's commercial venture? What?? Are you an MBA now?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient holds up a hand.</span> “Hold on, Gary. It’s alright. You don’t need to insult Sam.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Oh, sure. As long as he gives the money back, though."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "This is insane! You stole it in the first place, you talked him into giving it over!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Gary, I appreciate it. But please let me speak to Sam without interruption. I would really appreciate it. I know how much you must want to speak.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "What have you done to us? You're so.. honest. I can't stop giving a shit about your vacation and your wife. Why would I give a shit?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sam, sit down. I’m not going to try and make some sudden move for the money you’re worried about.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary doesn't say anything, but he looks smug. Obviously he's pretty happy that you've pulled one over on him.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam sits, then bends to the side and picks up the cash, putting it back on the table where it originally was. "Shit, nearly cut myself."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I'm going to have to clean all this up before the next supply drop.. quartermaster's supposed to keep a clean office. I can trust you with that, right? That I'm the quartermaster?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Yes, you can. How much money have you taken in with this scam?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam: "Uh, I feel like it should be more.. we've got at least a couple dozen people, but the money always seems to go as fast as it comes in. All those bars on the islands, and the girls, you know. This is a great job, as long as you've got spending money."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Yeah, it is. I should've picked a better partner though."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Everything's at tourist prices. Lots of rich assholes on these cruises - present company excepted - if you think about it, we cheat the ones who're cheating themselves."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Have all of your targets been rich? It seems like not all of them could be, or your threat of contacting the police wouldn’t be quite so powerful.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>14:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>You prepare to break, then, as the event proceeds towards its conclusion. Ir's to return to the field to address the cheering crowds and accept their accolades; later, she'll be formally awarded, anointed as a true veteran of the grand arena and inducted into the halls of veteran gladiators. Separately, the Guild wants to know what the </span><span class='u c12'>fuck</span><span class='c12'> happened here and underground, pressing </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Blossom for the answers.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>A third to half of the room is still taken up by Ir's bonfire anima. When she steps out onto the roof, it's stretching up to the sky once again.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Everyone is leaving Eikichi alone, then?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Veteran? That's getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Ir will still take another victory lap atop the tyrant lizard she's befriended while 'Arakesh' tends to his 'twin.'</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Not if he remains hanging around on the scene of the crime, or possible crime, or whatever the hell happened. And people </span><span class='u c12'>do</span><span class='c12'> remember him running off out of the stands around the same time the trouble started, so he'll be questioned shortly if not immediately.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She will even indulge the promoters in all the post-fight bullshit they're certain to want.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Ying will stay with Eikichi. She's not involved, but she can't exactly just go walking home with all her friends tied up in this mess!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom, of course, could ask the Guild the same question.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Well, Eikichi will walk back to the box, anyway. There's bound to be some snacks left. To Ying: </span>"So..."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Oh, "Arakesh" wants no part of the limelight. In fact, the less well it's understood that the Twin Dragons are actually acting at the beck and call of some mysterious southern shaman or whatever he is, the better for Ir's publicity. The Lunar melts back into the hidden machinery of arena.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>She's not quite skipping, but Ying's walking jauntily alongside Eikichi. </span>"Hm?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>W-what? Comes the reply to Blossom. Of course! Of COURSE they're getting to the bottom of it. No expenses spared. Top men. Top men! But seriously she doesn't know ANYTHING?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"Well, I don't want to pry... but how are the forfeits coming along?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>She narrowly avoids stumbling. </span>"They're... I've got something sketched out for Tatsuya's! I think he'll love it," <span class='c13'>which is maybe the worst thing she's ever said about her own work.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>By the end of the ceremonies, Ir has been all but drowned under ribbons, flowers, laurel wreaths, and suchlike. She's got a gleaming trophy with carved likenesses of her and her foes atop it - blue and red jade for each of the 'dragons', white jade for her own triumphant figure. A feast is thrown that runs late into the evening, at which Ir and her invitees end up rubbing shoulders </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>with Guild magnates, popular artisans and performers, and, of course, famed gladiators who've weathered other bouts in the arena.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir lets Marek slip away, while hoping he remains close by. These are his tyrany lizards, after all.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>If she wants to bring him along to the actual feasting, she might be able to manage it. She'll have to find him somewhere in the bowels of the colosseum and convince him to come along, of course.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Throughout the ceremonies Ir is polite but distant, allowing herself to be fêted but remaining the unapproachable champion.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Unless they ask her for a song, of course.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</span> <span class='c7'>Blossom curtly tells them that she has no idea who would have ordered such a thing, which is mostly true. Plenty of people who could, but the Guild knows that as well as she does, considering they're most of them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Eikichi: </span>"Do you think it's worse, ethically, to design an atrocious outfit for someone as punishment, or for someone who won't know any better and think it looks good?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Meditate on this while you do both."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Ying: </span>"Ughhhhhhh."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ir's angle here is savage diva. Unapproachable, powerful, and utterly unconcerned with decorum or local nicety. One or two of her favorite singles acts did this back in Pneuma, and she's certainly laid the foundation to build an image on. And crucially, she doesn't have to strip down to a chainmail bikini or some dumb shit.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>C'mon, just once-</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That guy gets the down-the-nose death glare.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Most of you can't help but notice that the conduct of the other gladiators towards Ir is a little strange. What seem at first glance to be a mixture of distrustful or even envious glances might, in fact, be better described as awed or even worshipful. There's a motley of other fighters around and, at turns, they're all giving each other significant looks or muttered comments or </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>whatever and it's certainly about the night's champion, and it certainly entails more than professional curiosity or fear of losing one's place.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>That's not how pro fighters should be acting.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>At least, not in all the stories Ir's heard third-hand about them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</span> <span class='c12'>Separately, the high-ranking Guildsmen in attendance are VERY pleased, and it's probably not just a matter of the day's turnout (especially since arena repairs are going to run much higher than anyone anticipated and Blossom was canny enough to negotiate for a percentage of the gross)</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>It's good Ir's decided to be severe and distant this night. Once she figures out why all these cats look like they've eaten canaries, the scowl is perfectly genuine.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She might not be as smart as Eikichi, Blossom, or Ying, but she's got the advantage of social position right now and she's going to take it. Ir stares each one of her rich hotshot genuflectors down -- not to intimidate them, but to commit their faces to memory along with their names.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>She probably intimidates them anyway, and that's fine.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The food and drink are fantastic, and she's tired enough that they don't even taste like ash in her mouth. She entertains her entire public to the best of her ability -- aloof, but not too aloof. Beautiful, but with an edge to her. She spent a lot of time in Pneuma learning stage presence.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> At Miramar, under the willows and on the edge of the water, three hundred pairs of eyes turn to see the new arrivals. The boat wobbles and lifts as its armored passengers step one by one off onto the landing’s flagstones, with the Princess’s retainers helping the three northern lords. The plan has been made. All that remains is for the barons to carry it out. As the novelty wears off, the party returns to itself, and the hum</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> of conversation and soft music returns. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The three barons are standing in front of a wide grass lawn, littered with tables and serving platters overloaded with food. Bottles of champagne and other liquours are thick as the grass out here. There’s the heavy scent of blood in the air, coming from somewhere closer to the house. It’s hard to see through the crowd, but if you stand on your tip-toes, you can see the first floor lit through a series of huge double doors, </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> with more people inside. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav's armor is as comfortable and unrestrictive as fashion will permit. If he can get away with just wearing a breastplate over his suit jacket, he will.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Thanks to ancient sexist tradition, KJ's able to get away without armour at all. Nobody knows you're dangerous if you actually aren't!</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The question is how many people we're going to have to meet/greet first. In other circumstances this might be enjoyable.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>'Too many.'</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ will have to blame the sexism of her own court, since there’s plenty of women wearing full plate getups. The Princess, for one. She inclines her head as you part. “Good luck. I will meet you back here at the launch in…” She starts an elegant-looking silver stopwatch on her wrist. “260 minutes.” It’s almost 11 o’clock at night. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ominous.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> She hums a little to test the noise of the crowd, how audible everything is. Of course a lot of others here don't need ears to hear. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>22:58</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>This many people in body armor tends to put Cav on edge. He wonders what kind of mock battle crap they've got planned for the evening.</span></p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well, what's the state of play? Surely there are some little cliques forming up, as they often do, and hey, maybe someone wants to talk to the new guy from L.A.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There are dozens of impenetrable little ones. As they scan the crowd, they can see people still glancing over out of curiosity, but no one makes a beeline for them. Out on the grass, you eventually see the familiar face of the Ambassador, Abby Gannon. She’s standing with a few other people, including one Cav’s seen before — a middle-aged man with shoulder-length black hair, dull yellow plate, and a blank, bored expression.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Where has he seen him before? It seems so near…</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> From the castle’s first floor, they can hear the sound of a scream, followed by a great gale of laughter. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>This is one of </span><span class='i c4'>those</span><span class='c4'> parties.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>The LA Invictus are a strange lot, but one thing he's genuinely glad for is that publicly toying with and then murdering kine as a social centerpiece is somewhere between unpermitted and unthinkable.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Not so in New York and, presumably now, San Diego.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Gannon sees KJ and the rest, and makes a quick expression that is impenetrable if you don’t know her well, and recognizable as “I’m so glad to see you, please rescue me from this conversation” if you do. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Not the kind of heart KJ was hoping to steal, but they'll need an ambassador on side if things go poorly tonight. She sashays over that way, trying not to knock any suits of armour over.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Oh. The last time Cav saw this person, they were reassembling themselves out of a murder of crows on top of a skyscraper, having just missed Cav, Santiago, Seabury, and the former Ambassador as they evacuated themselves in a helicopter. The Count San Ysidro, Ochoa had said. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Well.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>This is going to be a fun party.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He hesitates briefly, then moseys on over.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Both Cav and KJ can see the robed and masked Nosferatu standing apart from the crowd, waiting. It must be K.J.’s naturally good eyesight, but she also realizes that there are heads mounted on the battlements of the castle, looking down at the party with empty gazes. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Christ. Maybe vampires should be illegal after all. Do they belong to anyone in particular? </span>"Abigail, may I borrow you? There was just one point about the itinerary of signings. I'm sorry to cut in, everybody!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>...Cav didn't realize KJ was about to do that.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Now she's left him alone with the Count.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Nobody she recognizes, though they all seem to have crosses cut into their foreheads. “Baron Valentine! Of course, one moment, then you must meet everyone…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"You know, I really should. Can we do introductions in a barbarously short interval?" <span class='c6'>She's basically imitating how La Jolla and her retinue talk at this point. Seems </span><span class='i c6'>de rigeur</span><span class='c6'>, which is also something else they say.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Well, not just the count. An enormous man, seven feet tall and extraordinarily fat, peers down at Cav as clearly less important personages take shelter in his bulk. “So THIS is the little delegation Bailey sent down…and who are YOU, senor?” The Count says nothing. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Gannon stops K.J. once they’re out of earshot. “You couldn’t find time to drop into my office before tonight?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I don't have a good answer for you, Abby, but I have an answer."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Did you know that the Princess La Jolla has a private rollercoaster?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby frowns. “So you did go with her to her little park. Why? Did she ask you to do something?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "No, that's the answer: the private wonderland. I said it's a bad excuse, but we've basically been alternating between the rides and clubbing."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Tell you what, let's catch up now?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby clearly wants to let it go, but… “Just clubbing?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ looks uncomfortable. </span>"Maybe I should've brought a cooler down, but.. do you know about the thing I've got? I spend a bit more time feeding than most of us."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He turns on the charm.</span> "I, my lord, am Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna, Shepherd, and late of New York City." <span class='c4'>He hits the proper mix of respectful, breezy, and arrogant that plays well with this crowd. At least, he hopes it does.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The corners of the huge man’s eyes and mouth curl upwards in delight. “Oh, I’ve been mistaken. Not one of Bailey’s fey little creations, then! No, a real New Yorker. Charmed, Baron. I am…eh….” He flaps a meaty paw at his retinue. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav's pretty sure that's not mockery in his voice, and given what 'New York City values' mean in the context of the Kindred community, that's something Cav finds very concerning. What sort of retinue does this man have?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Someone steps forward. “Clifford Jackson Gordon! Prince of Tijuana! Protector of Rosarito! Stalwart of the Grand Prince, First Order! Order of the Black Bird, full honors! Knight of the -“ The Prince waves again, shutting him up. The retinue seems to be made up of people who watch his every move closely, and flinch when he acts. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby: “I know. That’s fine. It’s just…you’re sure there’s nothing you want to tell me?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Ah. The man heading up the prospective pogrom, if Cav remembers correctly.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Yeah. He would love New York vampires.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Prince of Tijuana: “How did you end up in Los Angeles, Baron! It doesn’t seem to attract your kind of pedigree. Naturally.” </p>

There was a need of our services in the Brilliant Court, a request was made, and I, being a junior associate at the firm, was obligated to fill it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>He permits himself a bit of wryness in his smile.</span> "As you might imagine, it has not been the best...oh, what is the term they use these days...'culture fit.'"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"..c'mon, that's not how you do deniability. Save the friendly prying for when we get home, alright? When in Rome."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>It's great, right?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Gordon laughs. It’s like watching a meat section during an earthquake. “No! I don’t imagine it would be. I’ve heard a little of the Shepherds, of course. Very professional. Very capable. Not sentimental. The right kind of people. In fact…well, Tijuana has plenty of problems that could use a Shepherd. How does one contract your firm out, anyway?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>23:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby looks genuinely taken aback. “Oh.” K.J. can tell that she’s going to commit to something, and that she thinks she’s going to regret it. “Well. Ok. Just…be safe.” They stand there for a moment, under a canvas tent. “Do you want me to introduce you to the people Cavanaugh is talking to?” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>00:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cav does more than try: he succeeds! Sauer, for all her quickness, is kept in sight the whole way.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer looks like she’s thinking. Eventually: “You’re friends with Presbyter Vincent, right?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I'd like to think so," <span class='c4'>Cav says.</span> "She always got on better with Rollie, though."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "I've got two answers to that, one which you might like and the other one which you won't, and I'm not sure which is the real reason. Maybe both are."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer: “Now’s the time for honesty.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The first is, given that she was a source of assistance and power outside the formal chain of Invictus command while I was a deputy and now represents my direct territorial neighbor as a baron, being friends with her is merely good politics. I certainly have enough enemies in the Brilliant Court without running afoul of the priests.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "The second is that she reminds me of something I've never seen before; an odd, disquieting sensation -- perhaps an echo in the blood, perhaps just a strange deja vu.

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "But then, my religion was always money."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer relaxes. “Oh, okay. Hey, do you like the Bishops, or the San Diego Court?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ's answer will depend on whether Wilson's made his presence known yet. This might be a good time to slip away from Abby and into the bowels of the party.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Abby: “Oh, that reminds me. Where’s Baron Frost gotten to? Was he with you?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav purses his lips.</span> "I've no use for the former and with one conspicuous exception in the Princess of La Jolla, I prefer how my first interaction with the San Diego Court went as compared to this burgeoning horror show."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's done what he usually does at parties, which is park in one spot and talk to people who come to him. This is so much harder sober.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> In fact, nobody comes to talk to him. Lords and ladies react with shock at his uncovered face and walk away muttering. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Fun crowd.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer: “Nice. Well, you probably won’t -“ There’s a knock on a door leading further into the house, and the Presbyter turns to look. “Yes?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The door swings open slightly. A porcelain mask peeks through the gap. “We’re here.” It notices Cav. “Do you…require assistance.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Are they asking Sauer or Cav?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> It’s asking Sauer. Sauer: “No, he’s from up north. He’s with me.” She fishes a piece of paper from her pocket and reads from it. “1360 Pepper Tree Road. Dig under the lemon tree in the back. Should be 25 pieces, 5,000 rounds. Some special ones, I don’t know how many they put in. And five pounds of plastics. So be careful when you dig.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The mask: “Yours is behind the painting.” The door closes, quietly. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer looks at the painting again. “It’s pretty big. Help me take it off the wall?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> "Of course." <span class='c4'>Hopefully namechecking -- well, title-checking -- the Princess along with his stated feelings on the Bishops and San Diego have tipped Sauer to the vague outline, at least, of what he's doing at the party. It would be so gauche to actually say it out loud. Bad op sec, too.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> With the big oil painting lifted out of the way, there’s a hollow in the wall, holding a wide plastic case. Sauer pops the hinges and places it on the floor, kneeling in front of it. “Let’s see…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There’s what looks like close to $15,000 in bills, and something placed in foam holders: they look like four D-Cell batteries, covered in a dried, brownish substance. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer: “I get the sense that we run in the same circles. Maybe our ends just hadn’t met yet.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav laughs and shakes his head.</span> "Perhaps. But I've been...more distant towards the Prysbeter, and her parish, than I should have been since the partitioning. Maybe I'll start dropping by more often."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The only person to approach Wilson turns out to be one of the Nosferatu. It’s not until she speaks that he realizes it’s Sara, the one he’s been working with for a day and his assigned doppelganger. “Hello, Baron. Are you ready to start? We should find the others.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson ought to be miffed, but this isn't even the first time his understudy was a girl. </span>"Sure. Enjoying yourself?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Cav has seen these before. They’re what Rollie had in his flashlight. The brown stuff is supposed to be the blood of a martyr. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sara’s mask has a red stone under her left eye. Wilson could swear that for a moment, it gleams. “Yes. When I meditate on the fact that I can help others escape from this place.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Glancing at the batteries:</span> "Now there's a useful tool."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "I've always got guests and hardly ever see them. It's a good place to avoid everyone for a while."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sara: “Thank you. I’m going to be staying with the rest for a while, once we arrive. I’ll visit if I get the chance.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson motions for her to lead on.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Yesterday, as the barons went over the plan, the question came up: The Nosferatu are talented mimics, but they can’t provide much convincing depth if pointed questions start being asked. Will one of the three remain with the decoys of the other two, to provide cover? Or will all three be sneaking around? </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>If it's the former, Cav's the easy choice. He's got the skillset and is the Right Sort of Fellow, You Know, Just Has That 'It' Quality for this crowd of revanchist freaks.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Wilson's happy to hang back, but you probably want the decoy to be the guy who can't turn invisible.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> They talked it over. Cav would be the right sort of guy, it’s true…but Wilson has spent the most time navigating parties, and knows the best ways to bullshit away attention. Sara leads Wilson to where Abby and K.J. are. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Sauer closes the case. “I’ll be heading back to L.A. now. You want me to take anything with me? I won’t be searched. Or I can take a message to someone, I guess.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav shakes his head.</span> "Nothing comes to mind."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She picks the case up. “Alright. See you soon.” She leaves the room, passing a robed, masked figure. It’s Alberto, the Nosferatu Cav has been working with. “Baron. We should begin. The others are nearby.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Cav:</span> "Lead the way."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He does, and once they’ve collected the rest of the barons and Sara, the little group is led to a quiet, darkened portion of the first floor. A door is opened, and then they find themselves in a large, empty room filled with sinks and stainless steel appliances. The blueprints they’ve all been committing to memory said it was an auxiliary kitchen. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Alberto: “So. One last time. Baron Frost, myself, and Sara remain on the first floor. The others move upstairs and replace the item with the forgery. If no alarm is raised, the others return to the first floor, and the night proceeds as normal. If an alarm is raised, we withdraw Baron Frost and the doppelgangers back under the Princess’s protection, and you two will have to make your way to the other side of the lake, where </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>01:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> the Princess’s people will pick you up.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>02:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The light in the kitchen bends, and Cav and K.J. are looking at copies of Cav and K.J. </p>
