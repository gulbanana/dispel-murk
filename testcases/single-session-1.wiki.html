<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sun is rising over the desert. Spreading light reveals open-cut pits in the earth, great derricks and platforms, a complex of concrete painted flaking green and surrounded by radio towers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All the lights at Baikonur are off but for two buildings. One is a staff canteen where the tail-end of a party emits flickers of celebration and music which drifts over the empty launchpads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_aWGakJe4<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Around the other side of a missile test range is the secondary administration building, dedicated to Interkosmos - a hypothetical dream of cooperation which has yet to find any cooperators. They use it for now as storage and for this interrogation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are two men from the Party, tired and ruffled by long hours of questioning. It seems to have worn more on them than their captive. In keeping with the Hegemonic Ministry's strange practices, one of them isn't even mistika - a mage. Otherwise there's no visible difference between them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first man: "So you watched the rocket, without proper protective goggles. You saw its concealment from the eyes of America and God. And you say you saw.. something else, in that lack which should have been absolute."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second man: "Decreed free of information or perception."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Days later on the other side of the Iron Curtain, Cleaner gets the news from the Brigadier-Sublime.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What time is it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Comfortably post-prandial. You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The fuck is a--<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mid-afternoon?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors. "My people."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." Cleaner uncrosses his legs.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So it goes."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited. "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. "That's all correct." Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't all be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So as not to create any misperception of charity: "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. “Sorry,” he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> white shirts and white shorts. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sounds bad." Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He stands. "That be all?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for the Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. "I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> what I saw as another sun."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. “Good evening.” The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. "I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “So sorry. No speak English.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must not succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mm. Well. She’s seen it before. If there were any danger, she’d know, as she’s seen him deal with it before. There isn’t, so they’ll both stand silently, waiting for the messenger to resolve itself into something meaningful. While he waits, he chews on his gum. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Second. Hegemon knew about this before the Tetrarchs, before your own hierarchy. Not the first time that's happened apparently. Needs to stop. As a matter of professional courtesy I won't try to estimate whether Panopticon might be riddled with spies."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Third. Have you ever heard of the Invisible Order?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> "I feel driven to speak now for cooperation's sake." Perhaps unusual to the interrogators is that Epiphany hasn't once asked them a question. He has been the very model of incurious patience.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient's brief patience bears fruit- maybe sensing its limit, the wrinkled prophet backs off a step and fixes him with a glare before speaking more firmly. "No good in the eyes of God, the Eye of the gods. We won't have a prayer as of four P.M. March third T minus zero. Our final warning, watchers watched."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner never walked out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot needs to learn to calm down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You - two? you? - need to get your ass or asses to Florida several days too late to meet the man with the bird jacket, bird man, third man, triply absurd man."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He listens in silence, nodding and making non-comittal noises as appropriate.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> First interrogator: "We always appreciate cooperation, comrade."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Second interrogator: "It's all we can ask for."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Second interrogator, after a brief pause: "The operation of the rocket engine upon the air, upon space itself. Describe its action again?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I see. Thank you.” Claudio wonders where in the world it was that the Eye had offended the God, if that’s what he meant. He’ll wait for the other man to stop before asking. “Do you have any specific dates or instructions?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In fact, he’ll look for them himself, in the man’s mind. How is it? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The prophet's mind is a mess. You can see the signs of deliberate damage - his mentality has been torn apart at some point, either by an enemy or the man himself. Probably best not to think about it? But in those ragged channels, there's something.. an entry point for divinity? He sees the future, and probably not of his own volition.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unsentimentally: "Pentacle cabal. Operate in Orange and Brevard Counties. Possible ties to Miami Consilium. Possible ties to." He doesn't trail off, just stops talking. After a short pause, he rephrases. "Interesting how they operate in our territory. Merits a closer look."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Noisy. Inconvenient."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That’s unfortunate. Claudio reaches out and brushes the man’s mind with a restorative intent. Does anything stop him? It would be a cruelty to make someone like this. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Prophet: "Go take a hike. Or a cruise. Can't lose. You can't lose if you invest in the Pharoah's Daughter, Yarmouth Line, out of George Town on Sunday and two weeks to Port Canaveral. Because of the market, you know, the devil you know, better to ride a boat than serve a meal."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He freezes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The damage is deep enough that the original owner of this mind is effectively dead, but you can heal structure, impose something a bit more like regular function. Some of those tears close up. Shards of prophecy remain embedded like splinters, mental welts forming around them, but the patch job could last a long time, and he's old.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Epiphany: "As the report indicated, the primary device was an 11A57 functioning within parameters. All engines operational, no deviation in gross mass, normal burn time for all stages. There was an aberrant visual distortion, an apparent degradation of substance at the operant temperature, not in the rocket but in the air.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first one resumes. "But a deviation did occur. Will you submit your memory for examination?"<br>

"Room? Plenty of room.. I've got a place, thanks. You've.. well, see you around, enjoy the trip." He's trying to concentrate on something he can no longer feel, figure out what to think instead..<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The two interrogators look at each other as weak light filters in from the Kazakh steppes. Perhaps years of dutiful service and the backing of Paternoster count for something. For this much, at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "A simulacrum would be welcome, comrade."

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Looks like he's reading off some notes and perhaps not very carefully.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Thyrsus leading the Orlando incident response is accounted a Road-Builder on Foundations Immanent of the Georgian Tetrarchy and is (or was?) enough ranks above Cleaner to order him around totally regardless of Ministerial hierarchy, but yeah, he's not known for paperwork.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Now, the pharaoh statue comes to life. A produced pen-knife pricks the index finger of his left hand which draws patient script in red smears on the table. НИЧЕГО ИЗ НИЧЕГО When he's done, he licks the tip of his finger and then blows on the words, causing them to flare with white magnesium fire. Epiphany reaches into the flame and turns his hand palm-up. A <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The vision goes on, and on. One of the men watches, rapt. The other makes it five seconds before he kicks over his chair and stumbles back against the closed blinds, seeming to melt into the fragments of light. Neither Epiphany nor the first interrogator have time to care. The dizzying sense of opened space - the incomprehensible beyond - and beyond the beyond, vast, ordinary yet impossible- <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Within days he's on a plane to America, with a mission of comradely aid; strict admonitions not to speak; and a couple of strange farewells from unexpected persons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> How unexpected?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One refers to 'our mutual friend with the white chains', which must be a strange definition of mutual. The other has well-wishes from quite a lot of colleagues who he hadn't thought cared enough to organise such a thing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> How thoughtful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> They must not expect him to return.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, there's a lot of references from unpious fellow-priests to finding the American version of God.. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot turned up again as Cleaner's escort, as well as Caveat and Endless Depths. The others are nervous, hanging around the great lighted cavern of the Orlando Jetport, with the sound of military planes outside but no civilian ones for forty minutes now. The specialists' plane is very late.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He would have preferred to do this with Caveat or, ideally, alone. But he didn't voice that. Didn't seem like a useful discussion to have.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> There's no need to go searching. America prays to Saturn V.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Outside is the tarmac, military dorms, and the highway - a straight shot east to Titusville and the Indian River. It won't be a long trip once these people actually turn up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner will have parked his car nearby, preferably inside the covered hanger so there's no need for the visitor to ever walk out in the open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's in his civilian clothes now. Off-duty. Black mock turtleneck, charcoal blazer and slacks. Low-top black boots instead of leather shoes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat stands close, saying nothing, reading a little pamphlet from some sort of philosopher. Endless Depths is down the concourse trying to persuade the Dunkin Donuts to sell one last round of coffee before closing. Ynkblot keeps looking up at the sky and complaining, as if it will stop the sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Handgun in a shoulder holster under the blazer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> From Henrik David's point of view his plane isn't late. Being able to leave at all is a minor miracle, let alone on this short notice; the small jet he's in doesn't *look* capable of international flights, and indeed according to the steward earlier this is not an international airport.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are just five other passengers, some probably Seers and some probably KGB. The plane's interior is mostly dark now that the sun is setting outside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> America looks very large, below, and very open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Late, late, late. Do you think they got to the airline somehow?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Can't be a damn coincidence that the thing's arriving at sunset."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Apart from talking to Caveat readily whenever she asks and to the other two as much as they require of him, Cleaner will have been silent, leaning against either his car or another likely position, since they arrived.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik David closes his eyes and lets himself feel just the first breath of his relief and exultation before sealing it back up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat's asked a lot of questions about the exact work Cleaner was doing in Orlando, to make sure she's got it straight to take over. She hasn't mentioned the space program once, but has let him see her scrying, trying to get a look at their colleagues on the Cape.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll help her to whatever extent he can, but that's probably by staying out of it and staying in position to cover her. He's never had her talent or interest in the more...abstract arts of magic.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The steward's back, handing Henrik a little plastic bag full of documents. "Sir, your passport and biography. Would you like Baikal or orange juice?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> "Juice, please." Henrik's trying out his English; he considered trying to disguise his accent but abandoned the idea on the theory that no matter how he sounded, the Americans would assume his accent was Russian anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Endless Depths: "Shitwater, the good kind." He's carrying two cups and levitating two more in front of him, shielding them from view with his body - young, but stocky or even fat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Levitating.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't sigh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat does! "Dumbass," she tells the other Obrimos, but takes a cup. Ynkblot doesn't seem to want one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will take the offered coffee and nod thanks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The juice was not very fresh. It's almost dark outside and Henrik feels a little queasy as he carries his belongings down the steps from the small Sukhoi. There's nobody here, which is good because they seem to have landed on some sort of military base; the others, more experienced travellers, are already walking toward a modern looking Terminal building on the other side of the tarmac. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No stars visible above. A slightly sweet smell in the air. It's crisp, and in the distance he can hear the noise of cars. American cars.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "They're not waiting outside, at least. You've got the car ready? Depths, finish that shit and go set up for an escort."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner: "The car is ready."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll glance over at Caveat when Ynkblot looks away. His expression is bland, but she'll be able to read it: exasperation at this sloppiness.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Mmm. It's good to be on solid ground.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Incongruously, Cleaner hears birdcalls. The airport is full of trees, in pots and in little strips of earth, but he recognises Ynkblot's nimbus. Preparing for trouble.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He unbuttons his blazer. Easy access to the gun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A week into the cruise of the S.S. Pharoah's Daughter, the matter of tickets arises. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hm? What? Claudio has to be woken up, since he’s fallen asleep on a chair on the top deck, half-covered by a quite dated newspaper. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They were sold when the Yarmouth Line vessel initially departed Port Canaveral, an opportunity Oriente didn't have access to as at the time was on a different continent. There might not be a need for him to wake, though- it's Isaias who's been cornered by the grifter.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man claims to be associated with the cruise company and he has a staff shirt. But the offer is unorthodox.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In a little mid-deck hallway, between the cabins and a row of portholes by the ship's pool- "There's basically two ways to deal with your problem."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sailor smirks. He's sitting on an iron step, blocking the way past. "When we make landfall, there's the Brevard County Sheriff's Department. Or if it turns out you can afford the tickets after all - you and your friend look like you can afford things, one way or another - I can make this go away."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat moves closer to Cleaner. Looks like she's unarmed - not that she needs to be, but it always helps. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This doesn't seem to be a busy airport, though it's gleaming new. Henrik's anonymous fellow travellers bid him anonymous farewells at the unmanned gate, dispersing in various directions - he sees one lighted concourse with people at its end, a janitor moving along the wall between here and there. Everything is very modern and expensive.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She knows pretty well by now that there's a loaded Smith & Wesson Model 27 with an extra quickloader of .357 in the glovebox of his car if she needs it. The window is rolled down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In addition to the Welrod in his camera bag under the front seat, and the AR-10 in the soft canvas long-bag in his trunk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They've all heard the plane landing at last. Ynkblot: "Hey, good luck over there. We need you back, but only when this one's in the ground."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Isaias isn’t dressed for relaxation. He’s a slight, thin man with a slight, thin face and dark skin. He looks rather like a shabby academic, in his tweed coat with patches on the elbows and his sweater vest. There’s a light sheen of sweat on his forehead, but it’s from the sun, not from anxiety. In fact, he doesn’t understand the man at all. “Claudio!” Orient snorts awake and looks around. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sailor: <Incomprehensible american words, now sneering.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Isaias asks, in Arabic: (What does this guy want?)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient walks over to the steps. “What’s this? Sorry, my friend here - no English. Is there a problem with something?” (Hold on.) That’s spoken in no language at all, just sent into Isaias’s mind. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Henrik sees three American mistika turning toward him, looking bored and relieved. The leader is a wiry but heavily-muscled man, a ranked Seer wearing spells of transformation and power almost visible to the Sleepers closing up shops nearby.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The others are a woman, a pretty Obrimos with no obvious magic going on (but some magically concealed), and-<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Ministries signifiers and uniforms are different here - do they even have uniforms? Henrik isn't sure who's what, apart from the leader, who's scrutinizing him intently.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sailor, standing: "The jig's up, you know. I checked the passenger list against cabin allocations yesterday."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Here greeting the Americans is a man of average height, middle-aged and balding, broad at the shoulder, wearing a rumpled gray suit with a black greatcoat draped over his arm. He's got a single suitcase and his brow is ringed with burning white tattoos that almost but not quite seem to mean something. "Old friend," he says. There's no mistaking his accent.

Just a jack, some tools for changing a flat, a long soft brown canvas bag that has either golf clubs or a rifle in it (pretty easy to guess which), a carton of cigarettes that's half gone-through, and what looks like a box of ammunition.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sky is dark now as the barely-introduced mages leave the airport.

By the time you're fifty metres away you can no longer see or hear the Sabbat pack, though the road and the traffic on the other side of the bridge are still clear.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner sticks a hand out the window and gives them a peace sign with the back of his left hand as they drive over the bridge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the edge of the forest is a rest stop, where Ynkblot's car pulls up. The others have to head back to town, though they'll likely take a different route in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe the index finger comes up a second later than the middle.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does he want Cleaner to pull window-to-window like cops do, or stop the engine and get out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot leans out. Bits of black bark are flaking off his skin. "Sorry about that, comrade old friend!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's yelling past Cleaner to Henrik David.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't roll his eyes, even under the sunglasses.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We've been dealing with these assholes for months now. Fuck's sake, this should be a Camarilla problem but they've abandoned the area entirely."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Those are apparently the tolerable sort of vampires. Cleaner wouldn't know.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Henrik is talking to Cleaner, since shouting past Cleaner would be rude.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Seems to be a title for their gang bosses. Flint Jugulum there is only one of them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To the other Seers: "Guy gave his name, if we didn't have it before. I didn't. Flint Jugulum."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> The more he says it, the more it sounds like a regular name.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a hatchway to the side of the ship's rather noisy engine room which Orient hasn't seen open before. Inside is some sort of office alright- medical supplies and tins of food are stacked on shelves behind a man who is, indeed, wearing a captain's uniform. You don't recognise him, but how much attention were you paying?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "I don't want his name. I want his jugulum."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Classic Ynkblot.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Yeah, anyway, they can be dangerous. We'll get them. Until then probably don't cross the river without an escort, the damn Lasombra come out of nowhere."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Bishop guy himself is the dangerous one, though, and he hasn't got that power- doesn't matter, this isn't your job anymore."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient steps into the little office and nods. “Captain.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Endless Depths tries to say something but he's kind of squashed behind the Thyrsus there. The night deepens.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat hasn't even rolled her window down, but kind of shrugs goodbye.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's nod to them is meant for her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Onto the safehouse, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ship's captain?: "Mr. Kapic. This is about the ticket payment? I'm glad you've decided to make the situation regular."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unless the werewolves want to chat next.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is there a place to sit? “Yes. I don’t want to take advantage of your crew, of course. I am happy to pay my way.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When the Impala starts up again you've got a much emptier road. The forest is dense and humid, but it's just twenty minutes before Cleaner and Henrik climb a ridge to see the sea, then the land, then the sea. On the island between the peninsular rivers is a wide expanse of roads, cleared land, military bases and little townships - and the launchpads. Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship. It's still some way to travel, but they're thirty-six stories tall and bright orange.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are actually no chairs in the supply office. There *is* a logbook of some kind, which the uniformed sailor pulls toward him and begins writing you out a receipt. "1200," Gary informs him. Presumably that's in american 'bucks'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient nods and pulls out his wallet, counting out $1200 in bills. “And what was your name, Captain?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Call me Sam, Mr. Kapic. Have you been enjoying the cruise otherwise?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk. “Is this what you wanted?” he asks Sam. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oddly, that one was almost true. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient turns to Gary. “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It is very clear that Sam expected this.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sorry about that, yeah?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. “It’s alright, Sam. I don’t have any intention of turning you in. You can consider me a friend. I promise that I have your well-being in mind.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief. I thought.." He's kicking the fallen money into a little pile behind him. "Dunno what I thought. Fucking weird that Gary turned us in, though. Don't expect another share now, Gary."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "Who are you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's got the presence of mind to be standing on the cash, at least. The ship creaks and turns a little, sending pills and bits of glass across the floor.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I’m an importer-exporter, headed towards Florida to try and set up my business there.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Everything's at tourist prices. Lots of rich assholes on these cruises - present company excepted - if you think about it, we cheat the ones who're cheating themselves."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Have all of your targets been rich? It seems like not all of them could be, or your threat of contacting the police wouldn’t be quite so powerful.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful. But it also seems as if there are easier ways to find that. Ways that don’t involve hurting people like this. And it seems like for all the money, you both have rather severe reservations about what you find yourselves doing.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Maybe I shoulda been a magician."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient adjusts Sam. He feels a tinge of guilt. With a little bit more patience, with a little bit more persuasion, he could have secured the man’s express consent. But he doesn’t trust his own persuasiveness. Oh well. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "That sounds like actual work. Look, why don't we just-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "?" His former confederate has a one billion-yard stare.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's looking into a world where things can- must- be different.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam shifts his chair back like the money in front of him is something repulsive, making a little squeaking noise. "Why don't we just.. find a better way. Find something, anything that doesn't do this to people."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Magic shows sound like a healthy creative outlet, Gary. I think you should look into it.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I think that’s for the best, Sam. Most people can’t enjoy money if they feel too guilty to use it.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "That was just an idea, but-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "Any idea has to be better than this. It doesn't matter so much what *we* get out of it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I suspect you’ll get more out of it than you think.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man keeps shaking his head a little like he's trying to clear away an unpleasant noise or a clump of earwax. Unfortunately it's Most Of The Thoughts And Impulses He's Ever Had.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe it's the noise of surf against the beach.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient stands up. “Well, I don’t want to keep you from your duties. Gary, Sam, I think that you two know as well as I do that your swindling days are over, and that we’re all glad that’s the case. May I take my money back?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Hey, I wasn't objecting." At least recently.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Sam?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Yes! Yes. Um, good luck with your business. I really hope it isn't impacted by- are you gonna be ok?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Weird how most people just go through life hoping the world will get better instead of making it into a better place. It may take a lifetime to find out why.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I’ll be fine.” Orient puts the money back in his wallet. “Are there any other people you’ve taken money from still on the ship? If there are, I suggest you return their money and apologize for the mistake. And I guarantee that you will feel richer afterwards. There is no amount of money that can replace the knowledge that in the truest sense, you try at all times to be a good person.” He shakes both their hands. “Thank<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you for talking, Gary. Sam. I have complete confidence in both of you. I think that today will mark the beginning of a happier time in both of your lives.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary happily and Sam with some trepidation shake, see their guest out, and start cleaning up the room and their acts. The guy on the dock sure is going to be disappointed.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio returns to his cabin and knocks. Isaias answers, holding a sleeping orange tabby cat in the crook of his arm. They speak rapidly in Italian once Claudio closes the door behind him. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (What did you do?) (Talked to one, had to tamper a bit with the empathy of the other.) (Did it cost you?) (A little. Nothing to worry about.) <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Isaias rolls his eyes. (He would have understood just as well if we had thrown him overboard.) <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If more briefly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio shrugs. (I’m sure that my patience will run out sometime in the future. There will be occasions to act irresponsibly. Do you feel like a match of badminton? They put up a court on the uppermost deck.) <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Pharoah's Daughter steams onward, out of the Bahamas toward Florida coast. By the time it reaches Port Canaveral, it's too late- they've put men in space. But at least Orient will get to see what happens next.<br>
