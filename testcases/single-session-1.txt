[09:20] <banana> The sun is rising over the desert. Spreading light reveals open-cut pits in the earth, great derricks and platforms, a complex of concrete painted flaking green and surrounded by radio towers.
[09:22] <banana> All the lights at Baikonur are off but for two buildings. One is a staff canteen where the tail-end of a party emits flickers of celebration and music which drifts over the empty launchpads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_aWGakJe4
[09:26] <banana> Around the other side of a missile test range is the secondary administration building, dedicated to Interkosmos - a hypothetical dream of cooperation which has yet to find any cooperators. They use it for now as storage and for this interrogation.
[09:30] <banana> There are two men from the Party, tired and ruffled by long hours of questioning. It seems to have worn more on them than their captive. In keeping with the Hegemonic Ministry's strange practices, one of them isn't even mistika - a mage. Otherwise there's no visible difference between them.
[09:33] <banana> The first man: "So you watched the rocket, without proper protective goggles. You saw its concealment from the eyes of America and God. And you say you saw.. something else, in that lack which should have been absolute."
[09:33] <banana> The second man: "Decreed free of information or perception."
[09:37] <banana> Days later on the other side of the Iron Curtain, Cleaner gets the news from the Brigadier-Sublime.
[09:38] <Crion> What time is it?
[09:41] <banana> Comfortably post-prandial. You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.
[09:41] <Crion> The fuck is a--
[09:41] <Crion> Mid-afternoon?
[09:42] <banana> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."
[09:42] <banana> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."
[09:45] <banana> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.
[09:45] <Crion> Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors. "My people."
[09:46] <Crion> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." Cleaner uncrosses his legs.
[09:46] <Crion> "So it goes."
[09:46] <banana> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.
[09:47] <Crion> He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited. "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"
[09:48] <banana> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. 
[09:49] <VoxPVoxD> A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. "That's all correct." Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.
[09:50] <banana> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't all be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.
[09:51] <Crion> So as not to create any misperception of charity: "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."
[09:52] <Quaker> It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. “Sorry,” he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in
[09:52] <Quaker> white shirts and white shorts. 
[09:57] <banana> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."
[09:58] <banana> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."
[09:59] <Crion> "Sounds bad." Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.
[09:59] <Crion> He stands. "That be all?"
[10:01] <banana> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"
[10:05] <banana> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.
[10:06] <Crion> Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.
[10:07] <banana> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for the Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.
[10:11] <VoxPVoxD> Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. "I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted 
[10:11] <VoxPVoxD> what I saw as another sun."
[10:11] <banana> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. 
[10:11] <banana> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."
[10:14] <banana> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."
[10:15] <Quaker> Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. “Good evening.” The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. 
[10:16] <banana> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.
[10:17] <banana> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"
[10:17] <banana> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."
[10:17] <banana> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."
[10:17] <banana> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."
[10:21] <banana> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"
[10:21] <VoxPVoxD> Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. "I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."
[10:22] <banana> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."
[10:22] <banana> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"
[10:23] <Quaker> Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. 
[10:23] <Quaker> “So sorry. No speak English.” 
[10:24] <banana> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."
[10:25] <banana> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.
[10:28] <banana> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must not succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."
[10:28] <Quaker> Mm. Well. She’s seen it before. If there were any danger, she’d know, as she’s seen him deal with it before. There isn’t, so they’ll both stand silently, waiting for the messenger to resolve itself into something meaningful. While he waits, he chews on his gum. 
[10:29] <banana> Ynkblot: "Second. Hegemon knew about this before the Tetrarchs, before your own hierarchy. Not the first time that's happened apparently. Needs to stop. As a matter of professional courtesy I won't try to estimate whether Panopticon might be riddled with spies."
[10:30] <banana> "Third. Have you ever heard of the Invisible Order?"
[10:30] <VoxPVoxD> "I feel driven to speak now for cooperation's sake." Perhaps unusual to the interrogators is that Epiphany hasn't once asked them a question. He has been the very model of incurious patience.
[10:34] <banana> Orient's brief patience bears fruit- maybe sensing its limit, the wrinkled prophet backs off a step and fixes him with a glare before speaking more firmly. "No good in the eyes of God, the Eye of the gods. We won't have a prayer as of four P.M. March third T minus zero. Our final warning, watchers watched."
[10:35] <Crion> Cleaner never walked out.
[10:35] <Crion> Ynkblot needs to learn to calm down.
[10:35] <banana> "You - two? you? - need to get your ass or asses to Florida several days too late to meet the man with the bird jacket, bird man, third man, triply absurd man."
[10:35] <Crion> He listens in silence, nodding and making non-comittal noises as appropriate.
[10:37] <banana> First interrogator: "We always appreciate cooperation, comrade."
[10:37] <banana> Second interrogator: "It's all we can ask for."
[10:40] <banana> Second interrogator, after a brief pause: "The operation of the rocket engine upon the air, upon space itself. Describe its action again?"
[10:40] <Quaker> “I see. Thank you.” Claudio wonders where in the world it was that the Eye had offended the God, if that’s what he meant. He’ll wait for the other man to stop before asking. “Do you have any specific dates or instructions?” 
[10:42] <Quaker> In fact, he’ll look for them himself, in the man’s mind. How is it? 
[10:49] <banana> The prophet's mind is a mess. You can see the signs of deliberate damage - his mentality has been torn apart at some point, either by an enemy or the man himself. Probably best not to think about it? But in those ragged channels, there's something.. an entry point for divinity? He sees the future, and probably not of his own volition.
[10:50] <Crion> Unsentimentally: "Pentacle cabal. Operate in Orange and Brevard Counties. Possible ties to Miami Consilium. Possible ties to." He doesn't trail off, just stops talking. After a short pause, he rephrases. "Interesting how they operate in our territory. Merits a closer look."
[10:50] <Crion> "Noisy. Inconvenient."
[10:51] <Quaker> That’s unfortunate. Claudio reaches out and brushes the man’s mind with a restorative intent. Does anything stop him? It would be a cruelty to make someone like this. 
[10:53] <banana> Prophet: "Go take a hike. Or a cruise. Can't lose. You can't lose if you invest in the Pharoah's Daughter, Yarmouth Line, out of George Town on Sunday and two weeks to Port Canaveral. Because of the market, you know, the devil you know, better to ride a boat than serve a meal."
[10:53] <banana> He freezes.
[10:56] <banana> The damage is deep enough that the original owner of this mind is effectively dead, but you can heal structure, impose something a bit more like regular function. Some of those tears close up. Shards of prophecy remain embedded like splinters, mental welts forming around them, but the patch job could last a long time, and he's old.
[10:56] <VoxPVoxD> Epiphany: "As the report indicated, the primary device was an 11A57 functioning within parameters. All engines operational, no deviation in gross mass, normal burn time for all stages. There was an aberrant visual distortion, an apparent degradation of substance at the operant temperature, not in the rocket but in the air. If you asked me to be lyrical, it brought to mind a film 
[10:56] <VoxPVoxD> reel that was melted through by projector running hot."
[10:57] <VoxPVoxD> "This distortion yielded to the astrosymbolic phenomenon I have already described."
[10:58] <banana> Ynkblot: "You'll probably get one. They've compromised the safehouse at Port Canaveral, threats of an attack. So item three is deal with that. We have names: Wildchurch, Cortex, Semiramus, Fixer. Perhaps Rockstar. We don't have descriptions."
[10:59] <Crion> Fixer.
[10:59] <Crion> Out loud: "Understood."
[10:59] <Crion> "Any live contacts up there?"
[11:01] <Quaker> Claudio will make the restorations as strong and deep as he can. Better - wait, two weeks to Florida? How many stops is it making? Isaias and his family are in Spain for the summer, so he’ll have to call tonight and let him know…”Thank you, my friend. Would you like anything for your troubles? We were just on our way to dinner. You’re welcome to join us. Or a hotel room, if you’d like.” 
[11:01] <banana> Ynkblot: "Oh, you'll have numbers on your side. At least five of Lewis's people and a few others in the area. The two thousand or so soldiers, scientists and journalists might get in the way."
[11:02] <Crion> Cleaner just stares at him for a moment, then thinks better of clarifying that he meant informants or other privileged contacts, not mere lackeys. Instead: "Is this a kill order, a capture order, a scatter order, or my discretion?"
[11:03] <banana> The interrogators speak over each other for a moment. "Please do not be lyrical-" "An interesting image, but-"
[11:03] <banana> The first one resumes. "But a deviation did occur. Will you submit your memory for examination?"
[11:07] <banana> Ynkblot: "Cleaner, it's a desk job. This is a promotion. Administration. Your task will be to make everything run smoothly, and if that involves killing you can order yourself or others to do it. Again, I suggest Trajan there."
[11:08] <banana> "For handover on the local business - is there anyone you're tracking, ops in progress, anything Caveat doesn't have?"
[11:08] <Crion> His discretion, then.
[11:08] <Crion> Cleaner: "No."
[11:08] <Crion> To be more precise: "Caveat has everything."
[11:09] <VoxPVoxD> Epiphany: "Would you accept a display instead?"
[11:10] <Crion> Cleaner: "Do I have a name for the one arriving at the Jetport?"
[11:11] <banana> The somewhat staggered prophet mumbles something about the offer of a meal. "Room? Plenty of room.. I've got a place, thanks. You've.. well, see you around, enjoy the trip." He's trying to concentrate on something he can no longer feel, figure out what to think instead..
[11:12] <banana> The two interrogators look at each other as weak light filters in from the Kazakh steppes. Perhaps years of dutiful service and the backing of Paternoster count for something. For this much, at least.
[11:13] <banana> "A simulacrum would be welcome, comrade." One of them gets ready to take notes. The other pulls down the blinds, to hide the intruding light and keep truths from the world.
[11:14] <banana> Ynkblot: "I'll send a couple of others with you as far as city limits in case those bastards are as well-informed as always. There should be a guy called Henrik and a guy called David."
[11:16] <Crion> Cleaner notes that earlier Ynkblot had said there would be only one, and now he is saying there are two.
[11:16] <Crion> He says nothing, though.
[11:16] <Crion> Clearly the man has other skills.
[11:16] <banana> Looks like he's reading off some notes and perhaps not very carefully.
[11:17] <Crion> "Understood." This time he'll wait patiently to be dismissed.
[11:18] <Quaker> “Wait, wait-“ Claudio puts a hand on his shoulder to steady him. “Here, hold on…” He puts two fifty dollar bills in the man’s pocket. “Thank you.” He stands with the man until he’s collected himself. 
[11:19] <banana> The Thyrsus leading the Orlando incident response is accounted a Road-Builder on Foundations Immanent of the Georgian Tetrarchy and is (or was?) enough ranks above Cleaner to order him around totally regardless of Ministerial hierarchy, but yeah, he's not known for paperwork.
[11:25] <VoxPVoxD> Now, the pharaoh statue comes to life. A produced pen-knife pricks the index finger of his left hand which draws patient script in red smears on the table. НИЧЕГО ИЗ НИЧЕГО When he's done, he licks the tip of his finger and then blows on the words, causing them to flare with white magnesium fire. Epiphany reaches into the flame and turns his hand palm-up. A 
[11:25] <VoxPVoxD> translucent image projects three-dimensionally in the air, the sight of a rocket launch, something burning, and something beyond.
[11:28] <banana> The vision goes on, and on. One of the men watches, rapt. The other makes it five seconds before he kicks over his chair and stumbles back against the closed blinds, seeming to melt into the fragments of light. Neither Epiphany nor the first interrogator have time to care. The dizzying sense of opened space - the incomprehensible beyond - and beyond the beyond, vast, ordinary yet impossible- 
[11:29] <banana> Within days he's on a plane to America, with a mission of comradely aid; strict admonitions not to speak; and a couple of strange farewells from unexpected persons.
[11:29] <VoxPVoxD> How unexpected?
[11:31] <banana> One refers to 'our mutual friend with the white chains', which must be a strange definition of mutual. The other has well-wishes from quite a lot of colleagues who he hadn't thought cared enough to organise such a thing.
[11:31] <VoxPVoxD> How thoughtful.
[11:32] <VoxPVoxD> They must not expect him to return.
[11:33] <banana> Well, there's a lot of references from unpious fellow-priests to finding the American version of God.. 
[11:35] <banana> Ynkblot turned up again as Cleaner's escort, as well as Caveat and Endless Depths. The others are nervous, hanging around the great lighted cavern of the Orlando Jetport, with the sound of military planes outside but no civilian ones for forty minutes now. The specialists' plane is very late.
[11:36] <Crion> He would have preferred to do this with Caveat or, ideally, alone. But he didn't voice that. Didn't seem like a useful discussion to have.
[11:37] <VoxPVoxD> There's no need to go searching. America prays to Saturn V.
[11:37] <banana> Outside is the tarmac, military dorms, and the highway - a straight shot east to Titusville and the Indian River. It won't be a long trip once these people actually turn up.
[11:37] <Crion> Cleaner will have parked his car nearby, preferably inside the covered hanger so there's no need for the visitor to ever walk out in the open.
[11:39] <Crion> He's in his civilian clothes now. Off-duty. Black mock turtleneck, charcoal blazer and slacks. Low-top black boots instead of leather shoes.
[11:39] <banana> Caveat stands close, saying nothing, reading a little pamphlet from some sort of philosopher. Endless Depths is down the concourse trying to persuade the Dunkin Donuts to sell one last round of coffee before closing. Ynkblot keeps looking up at the sky and complaining, as if it will stop the sun.
[11:39] <Crion> Handgun in a shoulder holster under the blazer.
[11:42] <banana> From Henrik David's point of view his plane isn't late. Being able to leave at all is a minor miracle, let alone on this short notice; the small jet he's in doesn't *look* capable of international flights, and indeed according to the steward earlier this is not an international airport.
[11:42] <banana> There are just five other passengers, some probably Seers and some probably KGB. The plane's interior is mostly dark now that the sun is setting outside.
[11:43] <banana> America looks very large, below, and very open.
[11:43] <banana> Ynkblot: "Late, late, late. Do you think they got to the airline somehow?"
[11:43] <banana> "Can't be a damn coincidence that the thing's arriving at sunset."
[11:44] <Crion> Apart from talking to Caveat readily whenever she asks and to the other two as much as they require of him, Cleaner will have been silent, leaning against either his car or another likely position, since they arrived.
[11:44] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik David closes his eyes and lets himself feel just the first breath of his relief and exultation before sealing it back up.
[11:46] <banana> Caveat's asked a lot of questions about the exact work Cleaner was doing in Orlando, to make sure she's got it straight to take over. She hasn't mentioned the space program once, but has let him see her scrying, trying to get a look at their colleagues on the Cape.
[11:47] <Crion> He'll help her to whatever extent he can, but that's probably by staying out of it and staying in position to cover her. He's never had her talent or interest in the more...abstract arts of magic.
[11:48] <banana> The steward's back, handing Henrik a little plastic bag full of documents. "Sir, your passport and biography. Would you like Baikal or orange juice?"
[11:51] <VoxPVoxD> "Juice, please." Henrik's trying out his English; he considered trying to disguise his accent but abandoned the idea on the theory that no matter how he sounded, the Americans would assume his accent was Russian anyway.
[11:52] <banana> Endless Depths: "Shitwater, the good kind." He's carrying two cups and levitating two more in front of him, shielding them from view with his body - young, but stocky or even fat.
[11:52] <Crion> Levitating.
[11:53] <Crion> Cleaner doesn't sigh.
[11:53] <banana> Caveat does! "Dumbass," she tells the other Obrimos, but takes a cup. Ynkblot doesn't seem to want one.
[11:53] <Crion> He will take the offered coffee and nod thanks.
[11:56] <banana> The juice was not very fresh. It's almost dark outside and Henrik feels a little queasy as he carries his belongings down the steps from the small Sukhoi. There's nobody here, which is good because they seem to have landed on some sort of military base; the others, more experienced travellers, are already walking toward a modern looking Terminal building on the other side of the tarmac. 
[11:57] <banana> No stars visible above. A slightly sweet smell in the air. It's crisp, and in the distance he can hear the noise of cars. American cars.
[11:58] <banana> Ynkblot: "They're not waiting outside, at least. You've got the car ready? Depths, finish that shit and go set up for an escort."
[11:59] <Crion> Cleaner: "The car is ready."
[12:00] <Crion> He'll glance over at Caveat when Ynkblot looks away. His expression is bland, but she'll be able to read it: exasperation at this sloppiness.
[12:00] <VoxPVoxD> Mmm. It's good to be on solid ground.
[12:00] <banana> Incongruously, Cleaner hears birdcalls. The airport is full of trees, in pots and in little strips of earth, but he recognises Ynkblot's nimbus. Preparing for trouble.
[12:00] <Crion> He unbuttons his blazer. Easy access to the gun.
[12:01] <banana> A week into the cruise of the S.S. Pharoah's Daughter, the matter of tickets arises. 
[12:02] <Quaker> Hm? What? Claudio has to be woken up, since he’s fallen asleep on a chair on the top deck, half-covered by a quite dated newspaper. 
[12:06] <banana> They were sold when the Yarmouth Line vessel initially departed Port Canaveral, an opportunity Oriente didn't have access to as at the time was on a different continent. There might not be a need for him to wake, though- it's Isaias who's been cornered by the grifter.
[12:07] <banana> The man claims to be associated with the cruise company and he has a staff shirt. But the offer is unorthodox.
[12:08] <banana> In a little mid-deck hallway, between the cabins and a row of portholes by the ship's pool- "There's basically two ways to deal with your problem."
[12:09] <banana> The sailor smirks. He's sitting on an iron step, blocking the way past. "When we make landfall, there's the Brevard County Sheriff's Department. Or if it turns out you can afford the tickets after all - you and your friend look like you can afford things, one way or another - I can make this go away."
[12:10] <banana> Caveat moves closer to Cleaner. Looks like she's unarmed - not that she needs to be, but it always helps. 
[12:11] <banana> This doesn't seem to be a busy airport, though it's gleaming new. Henrik's anonymous fellow travellers bid him anonymous farewells at the unmanned gate, dispersing in various directions - he sees one lighted concourse with people at its end, a janitor moving along the wall between here and there. Everything is very modern and expensive.
[12:11] <Crion> She knows pretty well by now that there's a loaded Smith & Wesson Model 27 with an extra quickloader of .357 in the glovebox of his car if she needs it. The window is rolled down.
[12:12] <Crion> In addition to the Welrod in his camera bag under the front seat, and the AR-10 in the soft canvas long-bag in his trunk.
[12:13] <banana> They've all heard the plane landing at last. Ynkblot: "Hey, good luck over there. We need you back, but only when this one's in the ground."
[12:14] <Quaker> Isaias isn’t dressed for relaxation. He’s a slight, thin man with a slight, thin face and dark skin. He looks rather like a shabby academic, in his tweed coat with patches on the elbows and his sweater vest. There’s a light sheen of sweat on his forehead, but it’s from the sun, not from anxiety. In fact, he doesn’t understand the man at all. “Claudio!” Orient snorts awake and looks around. 
[12:15] <banana> Sailor: <Incomprehensible american words, now sneering.>
[12:15] <Quaker> Isaias asks, in Arabic: (What does this guy want?)
[12:17] <Quaker> Orient walks over to the steps. “What’s this? Sorry, my friend here - no English. Is there a problem with something?” (Hold on.) That’s spoken in no language at all, just sent into Isaias’s mind. 
[12:18] <banana> Henrik sees three American mistika turning toward him, looking bored and relieved. The leader is a wiry but heavily-muscled man, a ranked Seer wearing spells of transformation and power almost visible to the Sleepers closing up shops nearby.
[12:19] <banana> The others are a woman, a pretty Obrimos with no obvious magic going on (but some magically concealed), and-
[12:21] <Crion> A tall, vaguely handsome, intense but calm looking man who goes photo-negative when directly scryed and who is very obviously carrying a large-caliber semi-automatic handgun. He's standing closer to the woman than the...
[12:21] <Crion> Cleaner's face doesn't show it, but he's wondering where Endless Depths has slipped off to.
[12:23] <banana> The Ministries signifiers and uniforms are different here - do they even have uniforms? Henrik isn't sure who's what, apart from the leader, who's scrutinizing him intently.
[12:25] <banana> Sailor, standing: "The jig's up, you know. I checked the passenger list against cabin allocations yesterday."
[12:25] <banana> "Now, we've got the easy way to do this- you speak good english? Cheap way, good. Or there's the cop way."
[12:28] <banana> Ynkblot glances behind him toward the carpark and then takes a few steps toward Henrik David. <Welcome,> he says in godawful Russian, <you must be cool space man. Here we have to go fucking fast>
[12:29] <VoxPVoxD> Here greeting the Americans is a man of average height, middle-aged and balding, broad at the shoulder, wearing a rumpled gray suit with a black greatcoat draped over his arm. He's got a single suitcase and his brow is ringed with burning white tattoos that almost but not quite seem to mean something. "Old friend," he says. There's no mistaking his accent. "You look very well. 
[12:29] <VoxPVoxD> It's been what, three years?" I come in deference to you and on behalf of the Father.
[12:29] <banana> An engine revs- looks like Endless Depths is waiting in the other car.
[12:30] <Crion> Cleaner doesn't shake his head. Communication.
[12:30] <Quaker> “I speak English well. Could you explain your meaning in more detail? I purchased cabins for both of us until we reached Port Canaveral. (Shakedown for a few dollars. Don’t need to hurt him. Hey, could you check on the cat? I don’t want him to have to sit in the carrier if he vomited in it. I’ll take care of this.) Claudio fishes in his pocket for a cabin key and hands it to Isaias, who vaults over the railing and takes it. 
[12:30] <VoxPVoxD> He nods to each of the others and then follows their lead to the cars.
[12:31] <banana> Ynkblot, English: "What? Oh, hey. Nice to see you again, if that's what we're doing. Here, go with Cleaner, we'll be behind."
[12:32] <banana> Caveat: "Good to meet you, if brief."
[12:33] <Crion> Cleaner looks the man up and down, and nods. Then he glances over at Caveat -- is she riding along with them or headed off on her own?
[12:33] <banana> She'll be going with Ynkblot and Depths- escorting you and then bank into town. Cleaner has her number, although he doesn't know what his own is going to be, wherever he's going to be staying.
[12:34] <Crion> He doesn't appear disappointed by this. He nods to her in farewell, then says: "Passenger's side door is unlocked."
[12:35] <banana> Sailor: "Right, 'purchased' from someone on the dock who said he could get you in. No doubt. I can make this go away, don't worry."
[12:35] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik will follow Cleaner to the car, then. "Thank you. I should put the suitcase where?"
[12:35] <Crion> He'll either take the man's suitcase to put in the trunk, let him do it, or let him keep it. Doesn't matter much to him.
[12:36] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik will put it in the trunk himself. There's nothing bleeding or glowing in the trunk, is there?
[12:37] <banana> What does Cleaner's car look like? Endless Depths has an older Buick: http://i.imgur.com/A2GovXf.jpg
[12:37] <Crion> Nope. Just a jack, some tools for changing a flat, a long soft brown canvas bag that has either golf clubs or a rifle in it (pretty easy to guess which), a carton of cigarettes that's half gone-through, and what looks like a box of ammunition.
[12:38] <banana> The sky is dark now as the barely-introduced mages leave the airport. "We'll be with you for a few miles," hollers Ynkblot. "Got some fuckers making trouble around here, they won't leave the city, don't worry about it comrade."
[12:38] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik will make sure not to squish the cigarettes and then get in the car.
[12:38] <banana> The converted air force base still has a long wire fence, though it's being torn down to give the new airport a real facade. Beyond are city lights, many low buildings and a great deal of new construction - Orlando is rising.
[12:39] <Crion> This car, in Navy Blue http://playtoysclassiccars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/5884-Passenger-Front.jpg
[12:41] <Crion> Cleaner pulls the car out of park. "The most convenient name for you to know me by that isn't 'Cleaner' is Deputy Wayne Barrett of the Dade County Department of Public Safety, Sheriff's Office. Please open the glovebox, if you'd be so kind."
[12:41] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik opens the glovebox.
[12:42] <Crion> Cleaner: "Sitting in front of you is a Smith & Wesson Model 27 .357 magnum, fully loaded, in a brown leather holster. Next to it is a quickloader with six additional magnum rounds loaded into it. This is yours for the duration of your stay in this country."
[12:43] <banana> The two Seer cars form a little convoy, threading their way out of carparks toward an enormous multilane highway which doesn't seem justified by the residential density on the other side. It's not very impressive as a war party, but between the five of them Cleaner's pretty sure they could handle even a large scale assault from the enemy.
[12:43] <Crion> "Now, I'm aware that the Soviet Union is a fan of semi-automatic pistols. Have you ever held a revolver before?"
[12:43] <banana> You can just barely hear Endless Depths and Ynkblot arguing over their radio.
[12:43] <Crion> He keeps half an ear on those two in case someone lights them up.
[12:44] <Crion> Well, a little more than half an ear, when he remembers Caveat's in their car.
[12:45] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik David: "I have no training with firearms."
[12:45] <banana> Traffic's dropping off from rush hour levels. The roads are filled with trucks heading west to the Disney construction site and east to the Space Coast. Like you.
[12:46] <Quaker> “Are you saying that my tickets are not legitimate?” Isaias disappears off towards the cabin deck. 
[12:47] <Crion> Cleaner: "That's fine. They're very simple. The most important thing to know about revolvers as distinguished from semi-automatic handguns is they do not have thumb or trigger safeties. That's why their holsters always cover the trigger, and said triggers have a heavier pull. You cock the hammer, you point, and you shoot. The release where your thumb rests wheels out the chamber 
[12:47] <Crion> for reloading; that chamber then snaps back into place."
[12:47] <Crion> He glances over at the Soviet seer. "I'm saying this not to sell you a handgun, but to make a point."
[12:47] <banana> Sailor: "I'm saying it won't cost much to make them legit. You've been enjoying these fine company resources - the steel below our legs, the dining and the entertainments and so on - and if you're prepared to pay up then when we make port you won't have to pay for it another way."
[12:48] <Crion> "Anything you do with that--" He points at the glovebox with his free hand. "--in this country, I can fix."
[12:48] <Crion> "Kill someone, threaten someone, or just beat them to death with it -- anything you do with that weapon, I can make it go away in the interest of a better working relationship."
[12:48] <Quaker> Claudio nods. “Thank you for bringing this to my attention. What is your name?” 
[12:48] <Crion> "You start throwing magic around like..." He glances at the radio. "...some people, well."
[12:49] <Crion> "I have a much harder time cleaning that up."
[12:50] <Crion> "If you prefer an automatic rifle, I've got one in the trunk."
[12:50] <Crion> "Welcome to America."
[12:50] <banana> Orlando's dropping away rapidly, but the traffic isn't. Cars stretch out east toward the blue horizon and the intervening valley, lush with wet forest.
[12:51] <banana> In the distance, Henrik can see a bridge over a small river.
[12:51] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik closes the glovebox. "Thank you. Forgive me - you will be on the team assigned to Cape Canaveral?" He looks ahead out of the windshield.
[12:51] <banana> Gary: "Gary Sapp, fourth lieutenant." This rank does not exist. "And you're Saba and Kiflay. One cabin or two? Doesn't matter to me, you're entitled to zero."
[12:52] <Crion> Cleaner follows at a respectable but steady distance. The good news about this four-door Impala is that it was requisitioned as a special plainclothes unit through the Sheriff's Office -- so under the hood, it's a police cruiser, with the reinforced frame and souped-up engine that goes along with that.
[12:52] <banana> "Tell you what. If you haven't got the cash on you yet, I could stump it up for you. That's my role on this vessel, smoothing over difficulties. We can settle it soon enough."
[12:53] <Crion> Cleaner isn't visibly surprised that Henrik David turns down the gun. Usually they take it. At least he won't have to replace his backup. Either this guy's gonna make his life easier, or a whole lot harder.
[12:53] <Crion> To Henrik David: "That I am."
[12:54] <Quaker> “Two cabins. Thank you, but I can afford - how much was it, again?” 
[12:57] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik: "Has there been violence?"
[12:58] <Crion> Cleaner: "I am an Adept of Matter and a..." He pauses for a moment, blanking on the term. "...Apprentice of Death. I will be providing support."
[12:58] <Crion> Cleaner: "Not at the project site. Not that I've been briefed on."
[12:58] <banana> Gary: "You've only been on half the voyage so it seems fair to make it half, right? I'm guessing someone else left at Grand Cayman, got sick or whatever, hence the free cabins.. just twelve hundred, then."
[12:58] <Crion> "The reason for all of this is the situation in Orlando."
[12:58] <Crion> "It's fluid."
[12:58] <banana> Gary: "Would you like a receipt?"
[13:00] <banana> They come up out of the night, along the highway with roars which at first mix with the noise of the cars all around. Cleaner, driving the Impala at the back of the convoy, spots them in the rearview mirror before they're within handgun range. At least a dozen motorbikes and only one of them has a rider.
[13:01] <Quaker> “Thank you, Lieutenant. If you could write one up afterwards, I would appreciate it. Let’s go see the captain about it.” Claudio shades his eyes and looks towards the bridge, and starts walking. 
[13:01] <Crion> Cleaner: "Henrik David, I need you to reach into the backseat. The middle partition of the bench seating pulls away. You can reach into the trunk. I need you to pull out the soft, long canvas bag you saw in there when stowing your suitcase."
[13:02] <banana> Gary: "Oh, sure. This way, he's down by the engine room."
[13:02] <Crion> These people always have to fuck everything up so loud.
[13:02] <Quaker> “Please, lead the way.” Claudio will follow the sailor. 
[13:03] <VoxPVoxD> "Of course." Henrik sees them too as he turns around in his seat. "Ah."
[13:03] <Crion> "Just pull that bag out and lay it across the front console here. I'll need it in a minute."
[13:03] <banana> Henrik doesn't see the same thing when he turns around, of course.
[13:03] <Crion> A slight smile tugs at the side of his mouth. "And the Model 27's still there if you've changed your mind."
[13:04] <banana> He sees a gang of bikers - the famous american motorcycle outlaws! They're riding in a wedge shape, taking up the road and forcing traffic to wait or move aside.
[13:04] <banana> They're mostly men, but on the front bike - VERY shiny chrome and a particularly loud engine - there's a woman clinging to the driver, wearing a little cap but with her hair streaming back in the wind.
[13:04] <banana> The man she's holding on to is the only one you can see in the mirrors.
[13:05] <banana> Caveat: [[It's that fucker again. Ynkblot says don't provoke. We're almost to the river and your mission is more important.]]
[13:06] <Crion> Cleaner: [[Understood.]]
[13:07] <Crion> He moves the bag down across his shins, out of sight of the passing bikers. She said not to provoke.
[13:07] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik: "From Orlando?"
[13:07] <VoxPVoxD> Orlando is a fun word to say.
[13:07] <Crion> Cleaner: "From Orlando." There's not a trace of exasperation in his voice.
[13:08] <banana> As the bikers pull alongside the Impala- several of them on each side and one riding ahead toward the Buick - their nature becomes more obvious. None of them are giving off body heat, and they radiate Death - the leading man strongly and the woman even more so.
[13:08] <VoxPVoxD> "A threat display?"
[13:08] <banana> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQSGw0hMd_I
[13:08] <Quaker> Well, if Gary has an accomplice wielding a wrench menacingly or something, Orient supposes that he can sit and talk as well. 
[13:09] <banana> Lead biker, enormously bearded, bellowing: "YALL HAVE REINFORCEMENTS NOW? NICE. NIICE."
[13:09] <Crion> Cleaner reaches into his blazer pocket, pulls out his mirrored aviators, and slides them on.
[13:10] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik just sits back.
[13:10] <banana> Just a couple of minutes to the river. They shouldn't be able to cross.
[13:11] <banana> Biker: "We SAW your men on the plane and we SEE you, into your WRETCHED little souls." The others cackle and sing along to their obnoxious music.
[13:11] <Crion> Conversationally, to Henrik David, not speaking up so the bikers can hear but not whispering or lowering his voice either: "Ever staked a vampire?"
[13:11] <VoxPVoxD> "I have not."
[13:11] <Crion> "Don't recommend it, myself."
[13:11] <banana> When they hear the accent, the woman on the leader's bike whispers something to him.
[13:12] <Crion> "Messier than you think."
[13:12] <banana> Biker: "Oh it gets MESSY boy."
[13:12] <banana> Biker "Looks like yall are on your way OUT of town which suits us just fine."
[13:13] <banana> Another biker, with a mohawk obviously: "And stay out!!"
[13:13] <Crion> Cleaner, as they're almost on top of the bridge: "Be seeing you, Bishop."
[13:14] <Crion> "Real soon now, y'hear?"
[13:14] <banana> They're peeling away reluctantly. Biker: "In HELL yeah you will."
[13:14] <banana> "And if you make it to hell first- you tell em BISHOP FLINT JUGULUM SENT YOU!"
[13:14] <banana> "This town belongs to the god damned SABBAT!"
[13:14] <Crion> Flint Jugulum.
[13:14] <Crion> Well.
[13:15] <Crion> He has a name for the Bishop now.
[13:16] <banana> The vampires pull up in a long row by the side of the St Johns River, shadow gathering about them. By the time you're fifty metres away you can no longer see or hear the Sabbat pack, though the road and the traffic on the other side of the bridge are still clear.
[13:17] <Crion> Cleaner sticks a hand out the window and gives them a peace sign with the back of his left hand as they drive over the bridge.
[13:17] <banana> On the edge of the forest is a rest stop, where Ynkblot's car pulls up. The others have to head back to town, though they'll likely take a different route in.
[13:17] <Crion> Maybe the index finger comes up a second later than the middle.
[13:18] <banana> Endless Depths rolls down a window, gestures for you to stop a sec.
[13:18] <Crion> Cleaner pulls over.
[13:18] <Crion> Does he want Cleaner to pull window-to-window like cops do, or stop the engine and get out?
[13:18] <banana> Ynkblot leans out. Bits of black bark are flaking off his skin. "Sorry about that, comrade old friend!"
[13:18] <banana> He's yelling past Cleaner to Henrik David.
[13:19] <Crion> Cleaner doesn't roll his eyes, even under the sunglasses.
[13:19] <banana> "We've been dealing with these assholes for months now. Fuck's sake, this should be a Camarilla problem but they've abandoned the area entirely."
[13:19] <Crion> Those are apparently the tolerable sort of vampires. Cleaner wouldn't know.
[13:21] <banana> They have the Camarilla in Russia too, probably - it's hard to root the bloodsuckers out entirely, and anyway they've been around long enough to be one of the few credible forces that makes deals with the Iron Pyramid as a whole. These guys must be their offcuts and garbage.
[13:22] <VoxPVoxD> "He claimed to be a Bishop. Is that unusual?"
[13:23] <Crion> "Not for him."
[13:23] <VoxPVoxD> Henrik is talking to Cleaner, since shouting past Cleaner would be rude.
[13:23] <Crion> "Seems to be a title for their gang bosses. Flint Jugulum there is only one of them."
[13:24] <Crion> To the other Seers: "Guy gave his name, if we didn't have it before. I didn't. Flint Jugulum."
[13:24] <VoxPVoxD> The more he says it, the more it sounds like a regular name.
[13:24] <banana> There's a hatchway to the side of the ship's rather noisy engine room which Orient hasn't seen open before. Inside is some sort of office alright- medical supplies and tins of food are stacked on shelves behind a man who is, indeed, wearing a captain's uniform. You don't recognise him, but how much attention were you paying?
[13:25] <banana> Ynkblot: "I don't want his name. I want his jugulum."
[13:25] <Crion> Classic Ynkblot.
[13:26] <banana> Ynkblot: "Yeah, anyway, they can be dangerous. We'll get them. Until then probably don't cross the river without an escort, the damn Lasombra come out of nowhere."
[13:26] <banana> "Bishop guy himself is the dangerous one, though, and he hasn't got that power- doesn't matter, this isn't your job anymore."
[13:27] <Quaker> Orient steps into the little office and nods. “Captain.” 
[13:27] <banana> Endless Depths tries to say something but he's kind of squashed behind the Thyrsus there. The night deepens.
[13:27] <banana> Caveat hasn't even rolled her window down, but kind of shrugs goodbye.
[13:27] <Crion> Cleaner's nod to them is meant for her.
[13:28] <Crion> Onto the safehouse, then.
[13:28] <banana> The ship's captain?: "Mr. Kapic. This is about the ticket payment? I'm glad you've decided to make the situation regular."
[13:28] <Crion> Unless the werewolves want to chat next.
[13:30] <Quaker> Is there a place to sit? “Yes. I don’t want to take advantage of your crew, of course. I am happy to pay my way.” 
[13:31] <banana> When the Impala starts up again you've got a much emptier road. The forest is dense and humid, but it's just twenty minutes before Cleaner and Henrik climb a ridge to see the sea, then the land, then the sea. On the island between the peninsular rivers is a wide expanse of roads, cleared land, military bases and little townships - and the launchpads. Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship. It's still some way to travel, but they're thirty-six stories tall and bright orange.
[13:32] <banana> There are actually no chairs in the supply office. There *is* a logbook of some kind, which the uniformed sailor pulls toward him and begins writing you out a receipt. "1200," Gary informs him. Presumably that's in american 'bucks'.
[13:34] <Quaker> Orient nods and pulls out his wallet, counting out $1200 in bills. “And what was your name, Captain?” 
[13:37] <banana> "Call me Sam, Mr. Kapic. Have you been enjoying the cruise otherwise?"
[13:38] <banana> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.
[13:40] <Quaker> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. 
[13:44] <Quaker> He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk. “Is this what you wanted?” he asks Sam. 
[13:44] <banana> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.
[13:45] <banana> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."
[13:45] <banana> Oddly, that one was almost true. 
[13:45] <Quaker> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” 
[13:51] <banana> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."
[13:52] <banana> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.
[13:52] <Quaker> Orient turns to Gary. “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” 
[14:00] <banana> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."
[14:00] <banana> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.
[14:01] <banana> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"
[14:01] <banana> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"
[14:01] <Quaker> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” 
[14:01] <banana> It is very clear that Sam expected this.
[14:02] <banana> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."
[14:02] <banana> "Sorry about that, yeah?"
[14:03] <Quaker> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” 
[14:03] <banana> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."
[14:06] <Quaker> Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. “It’s alright, Sam. I don’t have any intention of turning you in. You can consider me a friend. I promise that I have your well-being in mind.” 
[14:08] <banana> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief. I thought.." He's kicking the fallen money into a little pile behind him. "Dunno what I thought. Fucking weird that Gary turned us in, though. Don't expect another share now, Gary."
[14:09] <banana> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."
[14:09] <Quaker> “How long have you been running this scam?” 
[14:10] <banana> "Just a couple of years since Yarmouth opened out of Port Canaveral! There are always a few people who want a cheap ride back to the US of A. You know when it works really well?"
[14:10] <banana> Sam: "Shut up!"
[14:11] <banana> Gary: "It works really well when they don't have a visa either. The guy at the docks tells them it won't be checked at the point, and then I regret to inform them.."
[14:11] <banana> "I really do regret it, you know?"
[14:11] <banana> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.
[14:12] <Quaker> “Sam, please! There’s no need for harsh language here. I imagine it works very well then, Gary. It sounds like it would work very well on very vulnerable people like that. I imagine they would be very scared.” 
[14:12] <banana> Sam: "Who are you?"
[14:13] <banana> He's got the presence of mind to be standing on the cash, at least. The ship creaks and turns a little, sending pills and bits of glass across the floor.
[14:14] <Quaker> “I’m an importer-exporter, headed towards Florida to try and set up my business there. Before I decided to emigrate, I lived in Milan with my wife. Before I came to America, I was spending time with her on vacation. The nature of my work means that I won’t see her for quite some time.” 
[14:15] <Quaker> Orient taps his wallet. “This was all the money I had on me. It was all I had to try and make a life for myself in America. You’ve taken about half. I don’t think my business would be able to survive on what I have left. I’m not sure what I would do if you kept it.” 
[14:16] <banana> Sam: "That's a real shame" and obviously completely true. "Best of luck with your uh, venture. I mean we're both businessmen here in a way, right."
[14:16] <banana> Gary: "Sam! We can't keep it, are you nuts?"
[14:17] <Quaker> “No, we’re not both businessmen. I’m afraid that you’re trying to rationalize taking advantage of people. Do you think you’re doing that? Taking advantage of people just like you?” 
[14:18] <banana> Sam: "What, so some wop wants to start a business instead of going home to his wife and somehow that's our problem? This is America, or it will be in a couple of days."
[14:18] <banana> Gary: "The business thing isn't real, that's not the point, the point is you're being a dick-"
[14:18] <banana> Sam: "No, obviously it is- you want to make a charitable donation to some guy's commercial venture? What?? Are you an MBA now?"
[14:18] <Quaker> Orient holds up a hand. “Hold on, Gary. It’s alright. You don’t need to insult Sam.” 
[14:19] <banana> Gary: "Oh, sure. As long as he gives the money back, though."
[14:19] <banana> Sam: "This is insane! You stole it in the first place, you talked him into giving it over!"
[14:20] <Quaker> “Gary, I appreciate it. But please let me speak to Sam without interruption. I would really appreciate it. I know how much you must want to speak.” 
[14:21] <banana> Sam: "What have you done to us? You're so.. honest. I can't stop giving a shit about your vacation and your wife. Why would I give a shit?"
[14:21] <Quaker> “Sam, sit down. I’m not going to try and make some sudden move for the money you’re worried about.” 
[14:21] <banana> Gary doesn't say anything, but he looks smug. Obviously he's pretty happy that you've pulled one over on him.
[14:22] <banana> Sam sits, then bends to the side and picks up the cash, putting it back on the table where it originally was. "Shit, nearly cut myself."
[14:22] <banana> "I'm going to have to clean all this up before the next supply drop.. quartermaster's supposed to keep a clean office. I can trust you with that, right? That I'm the quartermaster?"
[14:23] <Quaker> “Yes, you can. How much money have you taken in with this scam?” 
[14:25] <banana> Sam: "Uh, I feel like it should be more.. we've got at least a couple dozen people, but the money always seems to go as fast as it comes in. All those bars on the islands, and the girls, you know. This is a great job, as long as you've got spending money."
[14:25] <banana> Gary: "Yeah, it is. I should've picked a better partner though."
[14:25] <Quaker> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” 
[14:27] <banana> "Everything's at tourist prices. Lots of rich assholes on these cruises - present company excepted - if you think about it, we cheat the ones who're cheating themselves."
[14:27] <banana> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."
[14:28] <Quaker> “Have all of your targets been rich? It seems like not all of them could be, or your threat of contacting the police wouldn’t be quite so powerful.” 
[14:31] <banana> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" 
[14:31] <banana> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."
[14:32] <banana> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.
[14:33] <Quaker> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” 
[14:34] <Quaker> Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? 
[14:36] <banana> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."
[14:38] <banana> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."
[14:38] <Quaker> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful. But it also seems as if there are easier ways to find that. Ways that don’t involve hurting people like this. And it seems like for all the money, you both have rather severe reservations about what you find yourselves doing.” 
[14:50] <banana> Gary: "Maybe I shoulda been a magician."
[14:50] <Quaker> Orient adjusts Sam. He feels a tinge of guilt. With a little bit more patience, with a little bit more persuasion, he could have secured the man’s express consent. But he doesn’t trust his own persuasiveness. Oh well. 
[14:50] <banana> Sam: "That sounds like actual work. Look, why don't we just-"
[14:52] <banana> Gary: "?" His former confederate has a one billion-yard stare.
[14:52] <banana> He's looking into a world where things can- must- be different.
[14:53] <banana> Sam shifts his chair back like the money in front of him is something repulsive, making a little squeaking noise. "Why don't we just.. find a better way. Find something, anything that doesn't do this to people."
[14:53] <Quaker> “Magic shows sound like a healthy creative outlet, Gary. I think you should look into it.” 
[14:54] <Quaker> “I think that’s for the best, Sam. Most people can’t enjoy money if they feel too guilty to use it.” 
[14:54] <banana> Gary: "That was just an idea, but-"
[14:54] <banana> Sam: "Any idea has to be better than this. It doesn't matter so much what *we* get out of it."
[14:55] <Quaker> “I suspect you’ll get more out of it than you think.” 
[14:55] <banana> The man keeps shaking his head a little like he's trying to clear away an unpleasant noise or a clump of earwax. Unfortunately it's Most Of The Thoughts And Impulses He's Ever Had.
[14:57] <banana> Maybe it's the noise of surf against the beach.
[14:57] <Quaker> Orient stands up. “Well, I don’t want to keep you from your duties. Gary, Sam, I think that you two know as well as I do that your swindling days are over, and that we’re all glad that’s the case. May I take my money back?” 
[14:58] <banana> Gary: "Hey, I wasn't objecting." At least recently.
[14:58] <Quaker> “Sam?” 
[14:59] <banana> "Yes! Yes. Um, good luck with your business. I really hope it isn't impacted by- are you gonna be ok?"
[15:01] <banana> Weird how most people just go through life hoping the world will get better instead of making it into a better place. It may take a lifetime to find out why.
[15:03] <Quaker> “I’ll be fine.” Orient puts the money back in his wallet. “Are there any other people you’ve taken money from still on the ship? If there are, I suggest you return their money and apologize for the mistake. And I guarantee that you will feel richer afterwards. There is no amount of money that can replace the knowledge that in the truest sense, you try at all times to be a good person.” He shakes both their hands. “Thank
[15:03] <Quaker> you for talking, Gary. Sam. I have complete confidence in both of you. I think that today will mark the beginning of a happier time in both of your lives.” 
[15:05] <banana> Gary happily and Sam with some trepidation shake, see their guest out, and start cleaning up the room and their acts. The guy on the dock sure is going to be disappointed.
[15:06] <Quaker> Claudio returns to his cabin and knocks. Isaias answers, holding a sleeping orange tabby cat in the crook of his arm. They speak rapidly in Italian once Claudio closes the door behind him. 
[15:07] <Quaker> (What did you do?) (Talked to one, had to tamper a bit with the empathy of the other.) (Did it cost you?) (A little. Nothing to worry about.) 
[15:08] <Quaker> Isaias rolls his eyes. (He would have understood just as well if we had thrown him overboard.) 
[15:09] <banana> If more briefly.
[15:09] <Quaker> Claudio shrugs. (I’m sure that my patience will run out sometime in the future. There will be occasions to act irresponsibly. Do you feel like a match of badminton? They put up a court on the uppermost deck.) 
[15:10] <banana> The Pharoah's Daughter steams onward, out of the Bahamas toward Florida coast. By the time it reaches Port Canaveral, it's too late- they've put men in space. But at least Orient will get to see what happens next.
