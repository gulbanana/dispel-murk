<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> There is nothing - nothing at all - that is like the feeling of driving down an empty Southern California freeway late at night, with the music turned up and the windows rolled down. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The whole world seems to exist at a remove, lining the road in a series of tall office buildings and glittering shopping centers. The wind is never too cold to stand. The lanes are never busy this late. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ’s been invited…to a friendly hangout sesh, nothing formal. She knows Frances Yuan, of course. Does she know Jessica Kurtz-Campbell, who will also be there? Or her friend, Pearl Bernstein? Or Teresa Okienka, the Marquess’s daughter? Or Rosa Isaacs, the Seneschal? Anyway, she’ll at least know they’re a clique that extends back much further than she’s been dead. Further than she was alive, for that matter. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> While she’s thinking about that, she’s got something else to consider: two weeks ago, she received an e-mail from the usual throwaway setup. Be ready to be summoned when Lord Murray requests your presence. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>K. J. Valentine drums her fingers on the steering wheel. She's not paying much attention to the road - why bother, when you're invincible? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>This is it, she guesses. Sounding-out for hanging out. The little leagues of the big leagues. But hopefully not a big deal...</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ hasn't met Okienka, and she doesn't know Isaacs *socially* - but how could she not know Jessie and Pearl? People like them are a significant part of what keeps the Invictus - in KJ's estimation - more of a club than a chore. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The other thing doesn't matter because she's </span><span class='i c6'>always </span><span class='c6'>ready. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The gathering is on Baroness Manhattan’s sizeable private estate. A watchman at the front gate waves her through, and soon the lights from his kiosk fade in the dark wood that covers the grounds. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Tonight, KJ's wearing a thin grey coat over basically a t-shirt and slacks. She's looking good and looking forward to moving away from aftermath - all that war and now all this administration. Chats and debriefings are both preferable.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Half a mile in, the trees part to reveal a three-story Spanish Colonial manor surrounded by garages and guest cottages, all connected to the same wide gravel driveway. She can see her neighbor Frances stepping out of her Escalade as she pulls in. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> …carrying a long, hinged case. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Okay, this is a nice house.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>It's verging on 'noice'?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Still- KJ doesn't quite burnout, deplanes. </span>"Violin or tommygun?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances points her keys at the SUV and it beeps shut. “Shotgun. Did you bring your own?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"I so totally did not realise this was BYO." <span class='c6'>That's an obvious lie, because she's lifting a six pack of IPA out of the front seat right now.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Frances shoulders the case and leads the way inside. “Well, you can try throwing those at the pigeons.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Kurtz-Campbell estate is lavishly decorated on the inside - richly colored rugs and centuries old wooden tables. KJ can hear chatter from the kitchen. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Ugh! It’s not like I MEANT to fall asleep, Pearl. And nobody got hurt-“ </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Like.. clay pigeons? Really? Roll with it, but- </span>"I've never even held a gun." <span class='c6'>She's got a couple people for that, now. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> When she steps into the kitchen, the rest turn to look at her and Frances. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ waves with her free hand, but it turns into a thumbs up. </span>"This is a <span class='i '>really</span> nice place. Like the whole thing is Den."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jessie is dressed in some sort of gamekeeper’s plaids. “Really? Oh, right - one of the tech people. Well, it’s easy. You just point it at the -“ </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The gun goes off, blowing out the window above the sink. The others flinch, except for the short, dark woman KJ hasn’t met. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:10</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Oh, the safety was off. Anyway, it’s easy! Hi, K- oh, I’m sorry. KJ, this is Teresa Okienka, Baroness Modjeska. Have you two met? This is KJ Applegate, Baroness Anaheim. Are you two neighbors? I still haven’t looked at the new map…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “They’re not,” says Pearl Bernstein. Her rat-ears, slightly pointed and protruding front teeth, and blotched skin will quickly remind KJ of her clan, if she forgot. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Baroness Modjeska curtsies. “A pleasure, Baroness. We’ve only seen each other. Never spoken.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Hello! Hello. Great to meet you, and I honestly have no idea if that was a joke, Jessie.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:15</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The last guest tips the barrel of her shotgun over to KJ’s general direction. “You may borrow mine if you like, Baroness. I’m afraid that I find the conversation more pleasant than feeling this kick against your shoulder. It bruises, if you’re not careful.” Rosa Isaacs is as composed and elegant as ever. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>"Thank you, Seneshal. I'll probably keep the safety on as long as possible- which part is the safety?"</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Thank you, Seneshal. I'll probably keep the safety on as long as possible- which part is the safety?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Jessie snaps her gun open. “Huh? I wasn’t joking…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rosa indicates a small lever and makes sure it’s firmly in the On position. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: "Applegate is the, um, animorphs writer. I'm Valentine, but just KJ is good.."</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Applegate is the, um, animorphs writer. I'm Valentine, but just KJ is good.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Alright! Let’s get going! Enough of this dinner party shit.” Their host leads them outside to the patio. A row of target throwers dots the vast, flat lawn. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I liked the Animorphs,” says Pearl, quietly. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Pull, bitch-“ </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> At Jessie’s command, a target flies up. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The Baroness tracks it swiftly, and her gun cracks - out here a much flatter sound - </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The target explodes in a puff of hardened clay. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As they sort themselves out into an order, KJ finds herself sitting next to Isaacs and Okienka. Every so often, a gun goes off. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Man. It's going to be fun to find out whether this is fun.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “So, Ms. Valentine…I’d ask what you do, but…” The Baroness Modjeska looks distinctly unused to carrying a gun. She lays it across her lap, pointing safely away from anyone. “I suppose that question has lost much of its utility for those of us in our circles.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"Yeah, I mean! I drink and help regulate the drinking of blood. But in another sense I do computers."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Devops originally, moved into dev-rel, then moved south in a hurry. Now it's just a useful hobby."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Dev…rel…?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>..or maybe still her primary job, but she'll see what Baron Palos Verdes thinks.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:28</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Press releases and conferences. You know, 'MailMarm is disrupting postal delivery - join our team of independent contractors if you want to work with nosquirrel!'. I was professionally twitter famous."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "It's hard to keep followers these days, but I still blog enough to get the death threats. How about your deal?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Disrupting postal delivery…someone is robbing the Post Office? Oh, I’m a landowner,” she answers, as if it’s a very common occupation. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Well, among people who shoot skeet it probably is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “What’s twitter famous?,” says Teresa, before Rosa explains that it’s one of the new internet sites. “Oh.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> KJ adjusts: "That's all just techie terminology. It's not exactly enduring stuff-  actually, most people up there want to tear down anything that endures. Take it apart to put it back together better."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Are you on Amazon? You can find nearly any movie on there. It’s really quite convenient.” She seems more comfortable talking about this. “Do you like movies?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Yes!</span> "Who doesn't? I saw <span class='u '>Mad Max</span> last month, that was great, but I'm still sooo wrecked by <span class='u '>45 Years</span>."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Like, it's the kind of ending you think about once a week for the rest of your life- did you see it?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I haven’t. Rosa has told me the basic premise, though. A married couple receives news of the husband’s long-lost love. It reminds me of a character from Sebald’s The Emigrants - do you read much, Baroness? I feel that too few of us do. Too old or too young to enjoy it, in most cases.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The thing is, KJ doesn't mind mostly being around people who don't Get Tech. She has in-demand skills, ones oddly lacking in this community, and it's.. relaxing. A good reminder that real life, or afterlife as the case may be, does not take place online. The Bay Republic did Get Tech and it was </span><span class='i c6'>awful</span><span class='c6'>.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Yeah, it's all in the acting, though - if Charlotte doesn't win the Oscar I don't even know." <span class='c6'>She shakes her head. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I'm afraid most of what I read is technical material."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I liked Mad Max very much. I remember when all great films were built on the backs of practical effects and handpainted sets.” She sniffs. “Now, it’s…well, there’s commerical and there’s commercial…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Concerning your hobbies?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> In the distance, there’s a shout. “God damnit Pearl, aim at the targets, not me - “ </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Sorry…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Yeah, it's a field that constantly changes. An engineer's lifespan is the lifespan of their knowledge.. at least they say it staves off Alzheimer's."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Are you going to try smashing the pigeons? I'm going to be <span class='i '>really</span> bad at it."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>To Isaacs: </span>"If you don't want this back.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Teresa looks down at the guns. “I don’t think Jessica will mind if I sit this one out. You have fun, though.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rosa nods. “Please, go ahead.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Come on, incompetence loves company."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Pearl mans the target thrower’s yoke. The rest gather behind her on the patio to see her skill with the long piece. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rosa’s shotgun is actually quite beautiful - it would fit in just as nicely in some museum’s display as it does out here on the lawn. She can feel the fine silver embellishments, drawn in the shapes of roses, as they creep up the sides of the barrels. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>To Pearl, perhaps distractingly: </span>"Marco was always my favourite." </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Ready, KJ?” Jessie looks like she caught some birdshot in her thigh, but is otherwise unperturbed. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Sort of." <span class='c6'>At least there are all these women around holding guns to imitate. We probably look fierce as hell?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I liked Tobias.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Well, I.. hope he's not flying around out there somewhere, because this is going to be dangerous."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> They stand around for a while before Jessie explains. “You have to yell ‘Pull!…”” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"PULL!" <span class='c6'>She's already 'racking', if that is the word.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Pearl yanks on the lanyard and the pigeons go soaring to her right - </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The first shot disappears into the night. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The second one blows the head off a marble lion. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Ah, crap."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> As her audience claps politely, KJ can feel the phone in her pocket start to buzz. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “I didn’t even know birdshot could reach that far,” says Pearl. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I will level with you-" <span class='c6'>She's letting someone else have a turn. </span>"If it weren't for the wall I would've fallen over backwards on that second recoil."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Whoops!" <span class='c6'>KJ takes out her phone as she heads back over to where the No Fun Crew is sitting..</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>(To take her rightful place as a member, apparently, except- is this Murray?)</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The No Fun Crew looks like it’s having plenty of fun talking quietly. It’s not. It’s one of her ghouls, who only ever uses this number for one purpose. “Come now.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> That’s it. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Rosa looks up at her. “Hit anything?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>On the phone: </span>"Alright." <span class='c6'>KJ will make her apologies, gesturing at the phone without, of course, explaining.. she hands Rosa back her cool ass gun. </span>"Nothing I <span class='i '>meant</span> to hit. Sorry about the timing, everyone - I'll hit something next time, though. Yuan, I'm going to assume you'll be even worse- okay, I've got to move-"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The rest make their goodbyes. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>The nice thing is Manhattan Beach is pretty close to where she's going, now.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Baroness Modjeska has something else. “It was very nice meeting you, Baroness. Actually, a friend of mine brought me the original cut of Mad Max the other day. Black and White. If you’d like to see it sometime…” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Wait. She doesn't mean Fury Road, does she? KJ pauses on her way out, grins. </span>"I would love to see how V8 engines looked in the silent film era. I don't have a business card yet.. can I get your number from someone? Really gotta go."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Oh, it’s alright. I’ll have my help contact yours. Goodnight, Baroness.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "See you round, Baroness!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Normally KJ prefers 'Baron'. But, she can adapt millieu.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Palos Verdes is as silent as Manhattan Beach is bustling. Here, long suburban boulevards replace the city’s tight streets. From her vantage point atop the circular peninsula’s heights, she can see the Los Angeles coastline stretch out in both directions, shining with light until they stop at the woods and mountains. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:08</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>This is not something KJ has been looking forward to, but it's something she's been looking for. She needs to know where she stands, now.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The estate of Helena Murray is nearly anonymous among its neighbors. Just another gated mansion tucked in among a dozen of its siblings, unremarkable except in its obvious wealth. KJ knows the rumors that the three stories of her house are fewer than the basements built secretly into its foundations. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Here, too, she finds someone arriving at the same time as her. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:09</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>If it wasn't for the kind of work Helena Murray needed done, she might well have been staked on arrival in Los Angeles- at least she wouldn't be getting to think about whether it's archaic to gender a title. KJ knew it might not be over. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She knows Bill Burne. He’s stepping out of his Lincoln when she gets there. It takes a moment for him to stand to his full height. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Baron. Looks like you got the same call I did.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Baron North Long Beach. Are they going to upgrade you to something that's less of a mouthful?" <span class='c6'>This is a man who would scare KJ if it weren't for the things they've both done. She jokes to make sure to herself that he doesn't still.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:16</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> He doesn’t reply, but instead goes inside. The house inside is very dimly lit. If she couldn’t see well in the dark, she’d be at a disadvantage. She knows the drill. Burne sits down outside the locked door of the office. Together, they can look out the window to the driveway, and at the limousine that preceded them both. Its driver, short and bearded, scrolls idly through his phone. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:17</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>He's probably got the right idea.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:18</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ folds her arms instead, leans on the wall.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Burne spends the time making short notes in a small journal. A half hour passes before they hear another sound. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>..ok, if it's </span><span class='b c6'>that</span><span class='c6'> long she's got her phone out too.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:19</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Then, she can discern footsteps on the other side of the door, and - quietly, unhurriedly - it’s unlocked and swings open. A white-haired ghoul bows politely. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> His lips, like the rest of Helena Murray’s household ghouls, are sewn shut with white thread. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Burne precedes her into the parlor. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Yeah, well, he's welcome to it.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> The only light in the room is a hint of the moon that survives the thick curtains drawn across the windows, and a small oil lamp that hisses softly. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Besides Murray’s desk, which is unoccupied, there are two couches. The Lord Palos Verdes sits on one of them, pouring tea from a kettle into fine china cups. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Baron Valentine…” It’s hard to hear. Helena Murray’s voice, as far as KJ has known her, has never risen above a faint whisper. “Baron Burne.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ will sit on the other, unless Burne's on it. He takes up too much room.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>She's going to do something vaguely like a cursty.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> *curtsy</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>This is not something you actually learn how to do, in the 21st century, but the intent comes through.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> She’s the palest woman KJ has ever seen. Her mouth is like a short, penciled-in line. </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ: </span>"I hope so! There are a lot of good people in this Court."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:26</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Bill Burne’s head turns about one degree, but he refrains from looking at her. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “You’ve been free of your tasks for the past several weeks,” says Murray. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Did you enjoy your sabbatical?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ mentally runs through several answers along the lines of 'there's a satisfaction in creating structure, getting to grips with a problem, employing people to analyse and manage, analysing and managing their work in turn'. She settles on</span> "Yes."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Tea?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:33</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>Accepted politely, but only sipped. KJ was planning to kickstart her internal organs when they got up to the beer, but she had to leave early.. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Have you met any of your peers? The new class of nobility.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> KJ didn’t know how she missed it. There aren’t three people in this room. There are four. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> One of them is much, much bigger than the others. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "Just Baron Garden Grove - I think we'll die with knives in each others' throats - and Baron Yorba Linda. He seems focused."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> “Is something wrong, Valentine? You seem uneasy.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Murray’s question hangs in the air. If she’s trying to offer a cup to Count Bren, he’s too far away. In any case, his massive form remains still. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='c6'>KJ abandons the attempt. </span>"I'm unsure where we go from here. It seems to me there are a few possibilities."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Murray’s face doesn’t have a very wide expression of emotions. But KJ can tell that she’s displaying her equivalent of bemusement. “Enlighten me, please.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>11:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "You might need specific things done according to specific plans. You might need a cut-loose ally, a friendly independent. You might need, eventually, higher-level inputs into the planning process." </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:02</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> KJ would honestly be relaxing right now if it weren't for the two incredibly dangerous and silent Nosferatu. "Yes, Baron?"</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> KJ turns to look at who she's talking to, but she certainly won't try to actively pierce the shadow. Auspex lies quiescent, uncalled-for. "Nothing, Count."</p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>12:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> Murray continues. “And yet, Crook and Cross has seen fit to warn us. Of certain…irregularities of character. Certain disposiitons towards corrupting influences. A mistake in their process, they say.” </p>

<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It's a beautiful spring Sunday in Florida. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> March 9th, 1969. The Tet Offensive is in its second phase and the Suez Canal has been stormed. There's not going to be another Summer of Love ever again. All is right with the world.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The waters of the Indian River are muddy but the Atlantic is clear as far as the eye can see. On Cape Canaveral there's a hive of activity as the day begins; airbases and ports and civvie facilities all operating in unison, trucks and personnel pouring into KSC where the great gantries stand empty beside a steaming launchpad.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> That's the one thing that ruins it, really.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Far above the Earth, David Scott is walking in space. The Apollo 9 Lunar Module is orbiting the earth, a staggering triumph of engineering, bearing three Americans on their ride around the globe in a prototype spacecraft.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The mission isn't over, but there's already a celebratory air at the NASA complex. It's easy to navigate the crush of people and cars around the great white cube that is the Vehicle Assembly Building; the four strangers making their way through the crowd are in jovial company, nobody bothering to check badges or take names.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c4'>Sloppy.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Sloppy.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Good cheer is infectious. Henrik assumes it would put a smile on his face.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Installation security's not his job, though. Not yet, at least.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Out from Orlando and a temporary accomodation at Cape Kennedy AFS, <span class='b '>Cleaner</span> and the Russian <span class='b '>Henrik David</span> just have to cross a carpark. The general shape of the assembly building and its nearby facilities are familiar to Henrik, but it also strikes him how different everything is, how much further apart, how they've built their facility on a 'Space Coast' full of life instead of hidden away in the desert.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's in his deputy getup. He figures that's the right play for the moment.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He's always hated these damn hats.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik's heard the stories about what the Americans use their deserts to hide. It's hard to put much stock in them, but he's heard them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Orient</span> has been driven up from Port Canaveral by a man named 'Caddy', some sleepwalker who turned up at his hotel door three hours early. If this is his first time in America, he might have expected more dense urban infrastructure or less varied accents - but the G.I.s everywhere are right out of the news at least.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Cynthia</span> takes a different route to work, this morning. She used to work here, of course, but has been relegated to Operations and Checkout until recently. Very recently. She doesn't know precisely what to expect, since Lewis had someone call last night to say the meeting's been moved up to 9 AM.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Airmen in khaki and scientists in white and civilian contractors in denim mix under the sunlight and salt air. A big blocky entrance looms as four Seers of the Throne arrive, separately, together, to meet the man they're replacing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>He’s left Isaias with Uffa. For this, the first meeting, he’s dressed well. Caddy doesn’t have much to say, so he smokes and looks at the green world passing by. What a green. Much darker, hotter, wetter, than either the Po Valley or the coast plains of the Horn. He traveled to Burundi for a few weeks, and saw the same shades there. Caddy handed him a newspaper from a local outfit. The launch is today. Claudio hopes everything </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> went well and that the mission succeeded. When they pull up and it’s obvious that it has, he smiles. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia's car ride to work is a breeze, as usual. There's a small tin of cookies in the passenger seat, for all her old Sleeper colleagues. It'll be nice to see them again.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner doesn't like how little they know about this mission. And he especially doesn't like how well things seem to be going on the surface. Complications.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik is wearing a plain gray suit, checked tie with a clip. He's got a simple briefcase containing nothing but pens, pencils, legal pads, and a slide rule. He's </span><span class='u c10'>really</span><span class='c10'> curious how this went so wrong.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Your host's standing just inside a big square lobby, well away from the main security scanners by a little unmarked door. He shades his eyes against the sunlight leaking in off the coast and waves - this is <span class='b '>Lewis</span>, a black man in a pilot's uniform who looks younger than he really must be. There's another soldier with him and a little card for bags - did anybody bring luggage?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's bags are all in his car.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> *a little cart</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Orient sees: a decorated pilot strides forward to greet him, limned with song. Loud and bassy music kicks in the instant you see the man, his nimbus flaring to create what is in effect a theme song. It's no piece you recognise, though it sounds modern.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient left most of it at the hotel. He has a small rolling suitcase containing a few presents for his presumed associates, and a briefcase with notepads and pens. He rolls forward toward the pilot. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis has a little fat moustache which works surprisingly well with his cropped hair. He glances at you searchingly then smiles and says his name. "You must be the first specialist. Damn good to meet you and a damn good day."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Cynthia's not far behind, but Lewis hasn't greeted her yet. Not really a surprise. She doesn't know how much he knows, but- the project leader is a Master of Forces. Better not upset him.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>That's to Henrik David, Cleaner presumes. He's never met Lewis but it'd be pretty difficult to confuse him with the science team.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It's to Orient, actually - Henrik and Cleaner have arrived a little later, where they saw a group converging from across the carpark. No recognition here, but they're the only people with Supernal magic hanging off them like a birthright and an affront.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio sets the suitcase upright and holds his hand out. </span>“I must be. Good morning. My name is Claudio Kapic. Are we waiting for others, or proceeding inside for a briefing?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis: "Just a couple more. Here, Cynthia.. and those guys must be two of the others." To the uniformed aide: "Jack?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack: "Captain." He's going to load up Orient's baggage.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient thanks Jack as he takes the suitcase.</span> “Just mind how roughly you set it down; there’s glass inside.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Over in the main hall, you can see a whole delegation of reporters with flashing cameras following some VIP into the visitors' centre. The great <span class='c12'>E X P L O R E</span> sign which hangs over the hall is getting a workout from the streams of visitors and NASA workers today.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia walks in with a smile.</span> "Lewis, so good to see you again," <span class='c3'>she says brightly, and might even mean it. She extends her hand to shake his.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis calls over to Cleaner and Henrik: "Hey, welcome! Let's talk inside, through here!" He shakes Cynthia's hand, putting on a pretty good act if it's an act. "And welcome back to the family. Laborer will be delighted."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack, the private, is wheeling suitcases - carefully - through the little door already. Nobody's questioning your right to bypass security - not with the uniforms and the air of authority and the the constellation of access-affording magic that hangs about five mages of the Iron Pyramid.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik goes where he's told.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner moseys after him, checking out the security checkpoints -- or lack thereof -- out of habit.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia:</span> "Likewise!" <span class='c3'>She follows, making small talk with Jack about the weather.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> You're ushered quickly through unpainted concrete corridors, with just enough time to pass names around and check out each others' fashion sense. Somewhere in another part of the building, a P.A. system is going on about ship movements and splashdown planning.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Seeing Orient makes Henrik wonder if he should get new suits while he's here.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Henrik David," <span class='c10'>says Henrik David to the others, offering handshakes.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>A Russian and an Italian coming in to help showrun a Panopticon op in Florida. National borders don't mean what they did before he Awakened, but that's still mighty uncommon.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia greets the newcomers with the same smile she gave to Lewis.</span> "Cynthia. Cynthia Munroe. I'm local." <span class='c3'>Handshakes all around.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack is augmented by another aide who calls Lewis 'Major', and then they both vanish as you pass through a pasteboard door into a little anteroom. There's another door, metal; Lewis puts one hand on the handle and turns back to you. "Ready to meet the dream team?" There's no edge to his voice. From the other side of the door you hear laughter and the clink of cutlery.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner doesn't nod, smile, or take off his sunglasses, but he does shake hands.</span> "Deputy Wayne Barrett. Cleaner."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The call moving up their meeting didn't faze Cleaner much -- he's up an hour before dawn on workdays -- but all in all, none of this rushing is putting him at ease.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>But then, if things were good here, he'd still be hunting vampires.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient shakes hands, and remains quiet. He notices the accents, and wonders why they’ve called foreigners in to deal with what he assumes is Atlanteans planning to disrupt the Cape’s operations here. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> With no objections, the Obrimos pilot flings open the door to reveal a combination breakroom/laboratory. "Reinforcements are here at last!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> A cheer goes up from benches around the room. There are half a dozen people inside, curious faces calling out names, a little kitchen where a guy in a vest is making coffee. Several people are finishing up breakfast or brunch. All but one of them are visibly magical, and they're all wearing two little patches in different places on their clothing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> One is the NASA logo, an view of the stars with a ringed word and a red chevron. The other you don't recognise, but it incorporates occult symbology and the fasces of the US government.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Does Cynthia recognize any of them?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>The people, that is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> She does! Cynthia knows two of the mages from her work on the early days of Project Aningan; Laborer, the director, and the liason Dirt Cool. They're greeting her, and everyone is calling out their names at once - as well as those two, you all hear "Trajan", "Manhunter", "Fieldmouse", "Caddy". It's not yet obvious which ones go with which faces.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis: "We have specialists from Italy and Moscow, the best man the war could spare and our own Cynthia. Might be another guy later- things are going to get easier around here." He waves everybody in, newcomers clearly expected to introduce themselves.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia gives a small smile and a wave, like she's just shown up at an office party.</span> "I'm Cynthia, nice to meet you all! I'm sure Laborer and Dirt Cool have told you stories about me already, ha ha!" <span class='c3'>She laughs pleasantly.</span> "I'm sure we'll all get along just fine." <span class='c3'>Especially if you remember the stories about me.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner can't say as he's heard those.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Laborer</span> is a dark skinned woman who Cynthia vaguely recalls as more interested in technology than magic. She was hunched over a long table which is shrouded in utter blackness, but smiles slightly as she withdraws her arms from the void- one of them offers a half-full box of donuts. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik David: </span>"Good morning. I am Henrik David. I am dispatched from my position as Project Sub-Director for the State Commission on Piloted Flights. Also I am Primate of the Eclipse. So that is who I am. I look forward to working with you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Dirt Cool</span>, an older white guy in a suit with an incongruously healthy goatee, gives a thumbs up. "Kyle, for the new guys. MKWOMBAT liason - that's the U.S. equivalent of our project - good times."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Orient can recognise that Dirt- that Kyle has pretty competent mindshielding spells up. So does Cleaner, incidentally.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>How competent, exactly? Is the the only Mind Adept here? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia looks at the box of donuts from Laborer,</span> "Oh, I shouldn't..." <span class='c3'>she says, in the tone of someone who immediately does.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Actually, judging by sympathetic resonance, <span class='u '>several</span> of the Project Aningan team could be Mastigos. Kyle, certainly, but Orient thinks also the two men who haven't spoken.. not too surprising, in the Ministry of Panopticon.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's not compelled to give a longer introduction than the one he just did, but he's listening very attentively. Like as not this'll all be on the test later.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Trajan</span> speaks up from where she's perched on a lab stool. "Trajan, Praetorian Ministry, Vanguard/Interdict LV. 03." She's a woman of around thirty in running clothes, and when she looks at the newcomers they- there's something wrong with her eyes.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Glass?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The lower part of Trajan's face is ordinary, thin lips in a happy smile above a rounded chin, but from her nose on upward there's a bruise- in the air, not on her flesh. It looks like Paradox, a smudge filled with pain. Or, to Cleaner, with Death.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I do project security. You need anything murdered, let me know! Seriously, I love that stuff. I will also talk your ear off about the local hops - there's a brewery down at the port doing some great stuff."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Fieldmouse</span> speaks up in a generically Euro accent. He's got brown hair and smoked glasses, seems a little jittery, though there's no coffee in front of him.
