<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You might be at the turning point. The dark solars are at best stalemated with you and at worst on the back foot - Reckoning's retreating under Ir's escalating assault, Coils is lurching frustratedly like a half-dead bull, and Bells is barely composed, cycling from target to target. Behind you, Octavian's destroyed something like half the buildings ringing what was once a market <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> square.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stalemate?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let's do something about that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In a last-ditch effort, Dragon's Coils whirls and punches through the magic taking form between Eikichi's hands - more and more, you get the idea this guy is specialized in part in taking down sorcerers - and then tries to keep going and get his hands around the little shit's throat. No good, though - he's held back by his own injuries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She comes so close to getting her revenge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But he's too fast -- he dodges around the first attack and dissipates, appearing back across that barrier of pain.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She was waiting for that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir launches herself off the roof, driving down at the man who has beguiled, humiliated, insulted and hurt her and her friends --<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And he slips aside again at the last second.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So was he, of course. Fortunately, Ir's steeled her heart against the abyssal menace, and feels not a shred for sympathy for the simply itinerant preacher as he tries to dodge her deadly blows.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Don't tell me what I feel, asshole. I'm on to your tricks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya is about to try and use the environment to his advantage when Wicked Triumph's Reckoning appears right in front of him. It's a practically unconscious reaction as he brings his weapon to bear wherever he can find weakness!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The biggest and best-armored of the abyssals is still leaving craters around Eikichi's feet and sending violent vibrations up and down the linchpin, but starts and turns as he realizes how beleagured the necromancer is. Whirlling, Dragon's Coils attempts to beat back the two solars closing in on Triumph's Reckoning.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Doesn't work, though - Tatsuya's got this guy's measure, now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'd better, anyway, because a little girl with fangs and claws has just leapt onto Ir's back and started thrashing and scratching as fiercely as she can. The spearwoman's armor is holding for now, but holy shit is it annoying-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You have no idea.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir tries to slam the undead little idiot to the ground, but instead ends up losing her own footing -- and any chance she'd have had to affect the outcome of this fight, let alone effect the outcome of this fight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Reckoning's running out of avenues. He sashays as best he can through the fight, dodging around and behind Dragon's Coils, placing a steadying hand on the shoulder of the embattled Ir that seem sto be more for his sake than for the spearwoman's, but ultimately finds himself surrounded by all sides and short on breath.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We've actually just been standing in this one courtyard the entire time. There's an entire city of avenues out there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir tries to elbow him in the face. Doesn't work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He reaches out a hand towards Eikchi, who's in the process of fending off razor-sharp, green-stained blood chains that just will not stop flailing at him with increasing futility. "Sho...! Was this your idea?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I thought - you'd come to talk-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi seems to have dropped into a nearly mechanical fighting stance, parrying attacks with effortless reflex. It's clear his mind is elsewhere and has been for some time. "I did. Of the seven of us, I was the only one who didn't want to kill anybody/<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Reckoning: "Then stop this! You can't have come here merely for this!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "WAS THIS THE BEST YOU COULD DO?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The necromancer's eyes widen. "Th-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi snaps, rounding on the man he's convinced is his friend with tears and fire in his eyes. "There are bodies in the streets. These are YOUR people. This was YOUR plan. That's his daughter. You don't- you didn't mean ANY of it! It was just an excuse, you just wanted vengeance, you forgot how to DO anything but kill!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You betrayed me. You betrayed yourself. What do you have to show for it?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> His face twitches. "Vengeance is the least of - ...bodies are merely- ...the people kill-..." Wicked Triumph's Reckoning bites down on his own words, turning away (yes, in the midst of combat) and pressing a hand to his forehead before running it back through his silky hair.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He turns back, points. "You don't go far enough, Eikichi Sho! If you think I'm betraying the creed, it's because you haven't understood it!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'll SHOW you the best I can do!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Put up or shut up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Reckoning: "Rouse it!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bells, struggling with Ir: "Mrrf- rrgh- it's not readyyyy."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I KNEW it! This is just a project for you. The necromancy beneath the city."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Reckoning: "We're improvising!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "None of this means anything. You didn't mean any of this."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bells: "It's not even midniiiiight-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You're dead, and death means nothing."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "One of two ways this ends--"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Only Eikichi notices it - when Reckoning growled 'you swore', he shot a glance at Coils in specific.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi leans down and looks at Bells. "Hey. Have you ever been to Thorns?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bells is currently upside down, trying to chew off the hand Ir's using to hang on to Iscariot, but her eyes flash. "What- what do you know about Thorns!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I was there too. I saw the cattle in the streets, fly-blown and hateful. What was left of the people starved into eating them. What was being done to the people who survived. I saw the graves, the new ones and the old ones, all of them disturbed. Everyone lost a friend or a brother or a mother to the stink of that mountain-thing sleeping at its gates."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That's what Crystal is going to be if you go through with this.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi walks around Reckoning to stand behind him. "We could fight, sure. You might even win. But it's not the only way to settle this. And my idea's more fun."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tears well up in in the corners of the little girl's eyes, and as she's upside down it causes her eyeshadow to run up around her brow and past her temples.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh god there's a crying dead child on top of me.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emily continues holding onto Ir with inhuman, perhaps even monstrous strength. Funny thing is, Ir is stronger still, but unfortunately she has no real idea of how best to grapple with what's basically an angry, armored cat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wait-<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wicked Triumph's Reckoning, on the other hand, has got sweat beading on his brow. He's on so many back feet he might as well be a centaur and Eikichi's breath is in his ear and, ironically enough, his charismatic enemy has convinced his younger, weaker servant to betray him for the sake of her people.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir keeps stumbling around -- this time towards the single dad, and away from the hideous puppetmaster pretty boy. She's trying to keep her body between the crying heap of annoyance latched to her chest and the guy currently begging Eikichi for his life, because, well, she's got a pretty good idea what's coming.<br>

Ir has almost total recall and control over the entirety of the project, which is frankly...kind of a lot. Full situational awareness of a roughly 120 foot ship. She's driven something this big before -- it hasn't been that long since the Chambermouse -- but it's still worrisome. But's almost like she can feel someone else's hand on the wheel with her.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Cheer up! I probably will anyway."<br>

Usagi's doing some maintenance. The other demons are dead. So Eikichi's cabin is empty when he sits at the big silver mirror and looks into his own eyes. His face is pale and washed-out, his hair is greasy and flat. He looks like a wreck. "I'd pass for one of them already," he confides in his reflection. The caged thing under the cloth <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> stirs and groans at his voice. <br>

First, you must purify the ground. Something oil-based is best, to clean the skin without draining any moisture. Get a thin layer over the skin, use a little warm water to emulsify, and repeat. Everything falls away. "you won't understand."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir laughs. "Well.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She shrugs. "Pain is weakness leaving the body."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There is, in fact, still a red wet patch on the side of her blouse, barely visible now that her buff jacket is hanging open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Second you must strip away purity. Water here, to clear the residue of the oil. Desire, then, for the thing itself. This and no more. "you can't understand."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You should bandage that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Third is to strip away memory. Something abrasive, applied gently. Scour the skin, slough off the dead. Open it all up. Desire for the thing as it is, with no regard for what it was. "you can't see them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "I should do a lot of things."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He keeps going. The fourth step is to relax.

That's where Eikichi is right now, with stacks of incomprehensible mathematical notes and very simple sheet music balanced on top of it. He's got a glass of wine and he's got that unnervingly still posture Tatsuya recognizes as a sign his mind's wandered off into daydreaming. Probably anyone could sneak up on Eikichi <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in this state, nevermind the legendary Golden Hand.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya has been keeping to his room, lately, so his venture around the ship to clear his mind now is the first time he lays eyes upon it. There's a quiet "Hm." of surprise that anyone could be forgiven for missing. Upon noticing Eikichi, however, he goes quiet, and begins his work. Soon there's a comfy armchair pulled up alongside Eikichi, conveniently out of his main view, with a lounging Tatsuya resting comfortably astride <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> it facing him. "Nice piece we've got here."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...how long have you been there?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We're trying to figure out what kind of course to set after we leave Crystal, which I think we're going to do... tomorrow."<br>

Look for more ruins, build connections where there are more people and so forth. But it's still just an idea, and since you're the hometown kid I wanted see sound you out about it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He waves a hand. "Forget about the behemoth."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi looks at Tatsuya for a moment.<br>

Between her and you are a trio of her servitors, ancient, feathered wind bears whose <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> martial arts thus far have proved next to useless against a quartet of solar exalted.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The dragon's mad laughter has died down for the moment - all there is to hear is the howling of the storm and the clash of battle.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's essence blade comes arcing down at the last of the bears to remain dangerous, but it goes skating off the creature's thick, partly-feathered hide!

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> An unavoidable (certainly if you're mortal) shockwave of concussive force goes rippling outward!

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> By sheer coincidence, the dragon cackles: "The reckoning comes!"

But she's a Dragon of Heaven, trained to rule the world. She can gasp and scream his name and cradle him in her arms when the battle's won.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's faced the best this thing has to offer.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then there's a sound like a thunderclap and she's leapt across the deck, moving faster than any eye can track, cutting through the wind with a boom of her own, and there's another whirlwind on the board of the Heavensward: furious, lethal, and solar.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Just like that she's cut the thing to pieces, then shoots into the sky and drives down with her final strike -- not doing any more damage to the already-destroyed dragon, but dissapting it, scattering its wispy pieces.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Garuda's laughing and laughing and laughing - and then she's not, because she's too busy folding her wings and lashing out with her talons and summoning shields of solid wind against her impossibly persistent harrier. By the end, though, when her wings have been pried apart like some mollusc's shell and her aura tunneled through and her heart bared, she's begun laughing all over <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At last, Ir drives straight through the monster, which explodes into a storm of grey-green wind essence that expands and unravels all across the Heavensward's deck. Around you, the dark storm you've been trapped in thins and lightens and slowly opens itself entirely, allowing you to right the ship and get your bearings. The ship itself is in fine shape - the sails are a little ragged <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> around the edges and there are some unfortunate claw marks across the deck, but it's nothing that can't be repaired or polished over.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Indeed, the only significant change is that one of the three ancient, ghostly bears is still sitting at the ship's prow, asleep. Your hands pass right through it when you reach out to shake it awake, feeling nothing but an extremely cold wind.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir pauses for a moment, tip of Iscariot buried in the deck, then thumps heavily down into a sitting position, then lies back on the deck, arms spread wide, exhausted.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ginseng and chamomile that Ir left by the door to Eikichi's room.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One attack, five blows. The important part is that it was annihilated, other than the dematerializing and not dying part.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The next morning, the Exalted wake up to the smell of a delicious breakfast and the sound of someone humming an unfamiliar tune. In the kitchen, someone seems to have snuck onto the Heavensward - there's a stranger in there, a young woman with long pink hair and... a maid outfit? She seems pleased with herself. "Breakfast is ready!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So far, it looks all cosmetic.<br>

Some jewelry hangs from one of her bangs off to the side of her face, and she's got a brooch attached to the collar of the maid's uniform. "Hi! I made omelettes!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi walks into the mess and galley and gapes.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Since it's not really a kitchen, at the moment. More of a range shoved in a corner, siphoning off the Essence reactor.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She could've asked.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir sips the coffee.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "...Tricorn."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom takes a calming drink of whatever this northern mixed coffee is. "I wasn't really expecting--"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She discreetly adds another dab of Welcome to Blossom's cup. She'll need it. "And try to keep it one color."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I just realized."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She hums one bar of another song while nodding.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The reason the Haslanti had such low-flying kites and zeppelins and so forth."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Is because if they went too high... they had to deal with the air dragon."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Maybe we should swing by and demand payment for liberating their skies."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "She's still alive, though." Blossom points out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So after yesterday's debacle, the Heavensward is adrift a bit, but basically undamaged and still on its heading towards the near-eastern threshold. Right now you're still in what would be Haslanti airspace if the Haslanti ever dared to fly this high, though, and you've still got an old, wise(-looking) wind bear dozing fatly at the front of the ship.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh right. Bother."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The next time someone goes out to look at it it'll grumble to itself and rouse, so lemme know when that happens.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "They don't know that... but, we should probably take care of it permanently before we get payment."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Ugh, no, I want to go somewhere warm. Winter's coming."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "We were already heading south, weren't we? Nexus!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Good idea. I'm going to go up and make sure there's no more storms around."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Minutes later, Eikichi calling back into the ship: "There's a bear on the deck!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Still?"<br>

It blinks owlishly at you, which is a little more than a metaphor because of the ballroom mask effect the feathers around its eyes, snout, and jowls give it. "Greetings."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's got Iscariot as a lance, but isn't waving it around or anything.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom stands next to Eikichi, hands on hips. "Hello. Who are you, and why are you still here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying heads up on deck after Eikichi's message. "Um, hi?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The bear's wearing a big medallion with the old realm character for Wind painted onto it, and has got a long flowing scarf and a tall, boxy official's hat that ties under its chin - his chin, probably, if the voice is to be taken as dispositive. It might've wore longer robes or something once but they look to have mostly been worn away by time or destroyed by the growth of razor-edged <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> feathers.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A lot of nights are like that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the sound of really, really bad television fills the office, it drowns out the low hum of the city outside. The cars, the people, the dust - actually, there’s not been that much dust, lately. It’s been raining for a week straight. He can hear it against the roof. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tail end of the rainy season. Winter sticks around in California like a bum on the couch. Whatever. Noise is all the same anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nobody calls him. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hours pass. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At some point he switches to X-Files.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The next time Wilson looks at a clock, it’s 4:45 in the morning. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When he wakes up the next night, it’s raining even harder. No new mail. He can do what he wants. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well…there’s still the few envelopes that arrived yesterday. But nothing since then. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson cracks his neck. Checks his phone. Texts from Nora and Cora, which he answers with terse consolations. Slow period. Things'll pick up come summer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Around midnight he gets bored enough of TV to check the envelopes.<br>

It’s all automated, so he just needs to sign. There’s a few obligatory memos from the studio -everyone even tangentially involved at a high enough level gets these reports, even though it’s been quite some time since he worked in the industry beyond cashing a paycheck. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nora has put the last one in a manila folder. It glitters faintly in the darkened office. Gilded…<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He still reads scripts on occasion. Though lately he's even been outsourcing that to Nora. So he signs the invoice, skims the memos, and then-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah hell.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It’s dictated. Her handwriting is much worse. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There’s a knock at the door. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sure, sure. When it rains...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He stands up, smooths out his rumpled shirt, grabs the suit jacket off the coatrank. He's only a couple drinks deep tonight so he should be fairly lucid. Unlocks the door and opens it. Who's there?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A young girl, peering up from a black raincoat two sizes too small. She spins her umbrella in a circle, raindrops flying off. Politely, she hasn’t aimed it at him while she does so. “Good evening, Baron. Do you have a moment to talk about Jesus?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He know her? She human?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Her tone is gently ironic, of course. He does know her. Presbyter Sauer must be making the rounds of North Los Angeles again. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Presbyter! Pleasure to see you. Whiskey? Brandy? Gin?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “What are you drinking?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What do you want this time you Michelle Trachtenberg-looking "Tonight? Scotch and water. Should I pour two more?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She nods, and scoots inside, taking off her rain boots. “Yes, please. No need to open a new bottle on my account.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So he does. It's fine scotch. Nothing special. He blew through his last bottle of special Scotch on the war with San Diego. Nothing's been special enough to merit replacing it yet. "I hear Presbyter Vincent's been settling in."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Really? I hear she’s on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Or a heart attack. Or going postal.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "We've got the same information, then. That's a martyr's job they posted her to."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Hopefully not, seeing as it’s a posthumous designation. Can I sit down? What are you watching?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The coasters Wilson puts their glasses on cut crop circles into the dust on the desk. "X-Files. Take a seat, please." The furnishings in here are extremely nice and comfortable, assuming you're not prone to sneezing. Plenty of leather chairs and a big squashy couch against the far wall. Wilson sits behind the desk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer turns the chair to face the television and settles in, her legs not quite reaching the ground. She watches quietly for a few minutes, every now and then sipping her scotch. “What’s this one about, again?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He doesn't bear the Presbyter any ill will, but the invitation has aggravated his already bad mood in ways he can't articulate, and then here some comes, putting the 'botherer' in God-botherer. "This is Død Kalm, Season 2 Episode 19. They're trapped on a ship and aging too fast." There's David Duchovny in stage wrinkles as he speaks. "This episode was supposed to be a break <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> for the crew. They'd already booked the Canadian ship for earlier episodes. Didn't work out that way."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She must have caught something in his tone. She nods, and watches some more. “I’m not putting you out or anything, am I?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Me? Nah. Just haven't had a lot of company recently. I've forgotten some of my manners."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I don't see you too often, Presbyter. So I gotta ask: why is this night different from all the other nights?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Passover's actually next week, but still. You take your licks where you can get em.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “My outreach route rotated to North L.A. a few weeks ago. So…goodbye Culver City, hello Hollywood.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Been by Bixby's yet?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I was kicked out of one of his parties, if that counts.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It does in my book."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She looks at the television. “Do they ever…investigate wizards? Magic? Or is it just aliens and mutants and such.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Occasionally. Some demons, witches, cults. There's a stigmata episode next season."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Mm.” She wiggles her feet, absentmindedly. “You ever get into that stuff? The occult?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Not if I can help it. Can't always help it, though. There were sorcerers on the field in San Diego, for instance."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Even as inactive as I am, you see things. I don't need to tell you that. But it's never been a particular interest of mine. Why do you ask?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “It’s just been on my mind. We’re remodeling a wing of the library at Saint Chrys’s, so i’ve been going through the collection and making sure everything’s still there in proper condition. Lots of old things. Not really my field.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I guess technically I’m supposed to ask you for money, but…” She shrugs. “I hate begging.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "How much to escape damnation?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “No, it’s fine. I’ll get it from somebody else. Forget I brought it up. I know you don’t go to services. Just a lot of….uh…” She looks up, like she’s trying to re-establish her train of thought. “How are you doing? Out here. With all the movie stuff.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Doing well! Doing well. Nora and Cora take care of the knucklehead stuff for me, and it's mostly all knucklehead stuff. So I have a lot of time to myself."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "How's the lecture circuit?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I haven’t been on it the last couple of years. The last class inducted was five new students. No time for independent research. Just a lot of babysitting and survey courses. How’s the lifestyle of the rich and famous?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson snorts. "It gets worse every year. I don't know how more people don't snap. We're one good studio closure away from turning into South Korea."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She raises an eyebrow in confusion. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Highest suicide rate in the industrialized world. Look it up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Celebrities, too. Movie stars, singers..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Oh…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She stays silent for a while. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Has the whole studio system changed a lot in the past few decades?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You didn't come here to pick my brain about show business."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That edge Sauer recognized in his voice crept back in somewhere.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I, uh.” She swallows. “Jotham Bixby and his kind are hard to talk to, sometimes. Even if they decide to be nice to you. Very….self-assured. Unchanging.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I try not to, if I can help it." I worked pretty hard to get to a spot where I could help it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "But I can't imagine I make better conversation."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She seems to be thinking something over. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Her eyes focus on the floor. He can see her jaw clenched. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson lets her have the silence. He won't rush her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then, it passes, as if she remembers herself. Sauer finishes her drink and gently puts the glass back on the desk on the coaster. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Presbyter stands, and bows. “Forgive me, Baron. Too much time in the company of the informal and unserious has dulled my manners. I clearly am in no mood to be making my rounds. Please excuse this breach of professionalism.

I'm not a deacon, or a friend. But if you've got something you need to get off your chest it won't leave this room. It's not like anybody'd ask me anyway."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "If not, that's your affair too. I'll tell you good night and I'll have Cora cut your seminary a check first thing tomorrow."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson shrugs. He's had to build a lot of physical barriers to his solitude because once you get in a room with him, he's pretty easy to wear down.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVxoD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It's easy enough to think, circles we move in, that it's not that you don't want to talk to anyone. Just that you don't want to talk to them."<br>

They've got noseless faces, huge maws full of snaggly teeth, and long, apelike arms that are as likely to be wielding crude clubs and shortspears as they are to simply be flexing razor claws.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir rolls her shoulders and cracks her neck as they bear down on her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Time to see how much of a bond she and the emas have managed in their short time together. She pushes herself up, for a split second standing upright on the bird's back, then backflips off to land neatly next to Ir. "Go, Ami!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "No chance you can call a friend in on this one, huh?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We could use some quality girl time."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You know. Beating the shit out of the Wyld."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then at the salt-and-sulfur circle, with the bonfire in the center, Ying'll recognize what Eikichi is shuffling up. fthp-fthp-fthp-fthp "WHEREAS,"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're on the southern cliff face of the mountain Ir docked the Heavensward against, looking out over the open field Blossom and Ir rode out on, the bonfire visible for miles around. Sondok watches the ritual silently, her back turned to the night with its signs and stars. The wind whips the flames higher, and Eikichi's hair and robes billow around him, but set flat against the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> stone as he kneels at the rim of the circle, the cards don't move an inch as he sets them down. "-I invoke the entreaty of soul on soul, bargained for prizes material, of treasure won fair by blood..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He sets the first card up - The Malfean Arcana, a city of sin and glory everlasting. "...but I do not concede."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ami and Errant go bolting off behind Ir and Blossom as the two women square off against the onrushing fae. They can't see the faces of either of the mounted champions, but, somehow, they can feel the vicious grins behind the visors.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That just makes Ir's meaner.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying flips a page with a bunch of suggestions for hobbies for Tatsuya over and continues onto the next. She wants to make some clothes, but... there's a mental block there? So it's up to Tatsuya to figure something out, so that she can do that. After all, they have to work together! She shifts slightly from rock she's sat upon to look up with interest at Eikichi's spell. "Are all rituals like this?" Ying asks innocently.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Blossom lets loose and her flames connect, she somehow feels a familiar... clash, or tension, or dialectic. These are creatures of darkness, somehow, as fell and antagonistic to the earth beneath her feet as might be rampant demons or the unquiet dead!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's shuffling again. The card holds fast to the cliffside like it's been pinned. "WHEREAS, I come forward as the last and the first, at the precipice of certainty and mystery, to trod their bordermarches plain and staved..." The next card hits the cliff, the Fool's Arcanum, with its high and hanging zero overlooking the blithe young man or woman questing into madness. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...but I do not concede."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He doesn't look up at Ying. "Every ritual is different. Every ritual is the same."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom smiles grimly and conjures a sphere of flame between her hands, hurling it at the fae knight that is just slightly out of position! The apparent perfection of its gleaming silver armor and proud lances meets the actual perfection of a daughter of the Sun... and is! found! wanting! Not only does the flame batter and sear the creature, but soot darkens and heat crumples its <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> formerly glimmering breastplate!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The thing snarls and shrieks in pain, clearly in inhuman, and spirals sideways through the air as it tries to right itself and its mount despite the wounds. Plumes of acrid smoke rise from the crater in its chest.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She keeps writing. "Cryptic! Next question. How do you know what card is going to come up?" There's a sketch of an outfit Ying wants; anything to keep from having to wear the maid outfit around town. It's fine on the ship, for now, but she really needs to give it back.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The other asshole comes screeching out of the sky on his bug with a lance of his own. He's heading for Blossom. Ir's not about to let that happen. She smashes his attack aside with her own lance, then turns the haft of the weapon sideways and drives it into his(?) throat as he passes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's when the goblins move in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're everywhere, a whirling nightmare of claws and fangs and rough flint axes! But they hesitated in confusion for just a moment upon realizing that their prey wasn't running any longer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But she's got their number, too. Ir's a blur, dashing around the battlefield faster than the eye can parse, the only evidence of her passing the perfect clinks and clanks as every single of one of their blades is turned effortlessly aside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi might be so engrossed in his work that he doesn't notice the plume of dawnfire shooting into the sky some distance to the southeast, nor the spectral, faceless spearwoman that wars within it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying certainly does, though, and even if not she'll be the first to hear the thunder of hooves and the kweh-ing of Ami.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I know what card has to come up. Past that the Road provides." fthp-fthp-fthp "WHEREAS, the signed resolve to adhere in all respects to regulations, laws, prvoisos, and dicta cirumscribing the agreement and all who submit to it..." The Empress Arcanum - the seat of pure reason and power - sticks to the stone. "...but I do not concede."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Within a few more moments, the two mounts have come bolting back into the Heavensward's shadow, a pair of seemingly ordinary humans holding onto them for dear life. It's a man and a woman, both at least in their middle age. They're dressed in a combination of furs and what might be sackcloth and look sickly and malnourished.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi keeps going into the ritual, laying out elaborate clauses that Ying might not be paying attention to at this point. He doesn't notice the noise or the light, but Sondok does, and Sondok's coming down the mountain to meet the mounts. No sign of Ir or Blossom?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying hurries after Sondok to check on the mounts and their passengers. "Hey! Are you okay?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Man: "We... they... they're right... right beh..." He wheezes, unable to say much more, even though it was Errant rather than him that actually did all the sprinting just now. "Monsters!" the woman chimes in. "Fairies! Goblins! From the sky!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok, to Ying: "Can you tend to them? The others may be in danger."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At that precise moment in time, Ir is standing atop one of the fairy's bug mounts, driving Iscariot through its throat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "I don't think they're following you - they must be fighting Ir and Blossom. Are you hurt?" Is there blood anywhere? Obviously broken bones? To Sondok, she nods. "Leave it to me! Stay safe!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In fact, there is. The back of the woman's shirt is soaked through with blood, and the man grunts and nearly collapses after getting off the horse, clearly unable to stand.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Two red eyes burn in the night behind Blossom, the only definition in an ink-black silhouette. As the darkness bleeds upward from the silhouette's feet, green-burning plates clamp down on every part exposed. After a moment the only darkness that remains is the wild umbra of Sondok's hair and a jet-black bird's claw across her throat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying doesn't get to work quite yet, because she needs to figure out what work there is to do first. Shallow lacerations on the woman's back, what looks like an arrow shot through the man's ankle but then broken off, an assortment of scrapes and bruises from falls and impacts and other aspects of a rough and hasty retreat... these two will be in a bad way if they're not quickly bound <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> up and stabilized, and then there'll be infection to worry about.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also, the ears of the man and woman both are a bit pointier and smoother than they should be given their age and the condition of the rest of their skin. That's not hereditary - could be the beginnings of wyld mutation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There'll be supplies on board the Heavensward she can use for them. Bandages, clean water, medical tools, some towels... She'll have to consult with Eikichi or Blossom about the wyld mutation, but Ying can get to work stabilizing these two.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir, dropping off the bug mount into the dust, grinning up at the fairy: "Heh. Now you fucked up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok finds Ir nominally embattled, although really it's the faerie that's getting roasted. It's clearly been stabbed straight through the stomach, to the point of having direlance-sized holes on both the front and back of its armor, but it's still going, driven to fight back by some combination of inhuman power and pure spite. The creature doesn't bleed properly - what looks like <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> darkness, flecked with stars and multicolored bubbles, is kind of oozing upwards out of the wound and dissipating into the air around it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She steps past Blossom, grabbing one of the dragonfly's legs to give herself leverage as she leaps up to decapitate the cataphract and come crashing back to earth with a second stroke that scatters goblins like pins. She roars at the remaining raksha.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The head lands at Ir's feet. She kicks it at a nearby goblin, walloping him in the skull. To Sondok: "Glad you could make it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I was getting bored."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Well. Faeries will cure you of that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "And all it will cost them is their lives."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir steadys her weapon in front of her. "Eh. They weren't using them anyway."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying works quickly and efficiency, and that's a good thing since such things as gauze and bandages are also on the 'to resupply' list. Before long the two civilians or hunters or whomever they are have been stabilized. The man nods off to sleep, while the woman spends a lot of time thanking Ying profusely and also asking her who she is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Her eyes dart back to Blossom, then to Sondok again. "So anyone who wants to hit her goes through us, yeah?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That's one way to put it. I'd rather say that anyone who wants to hit her dies."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She sets to work as though she's done this a thousand times before. She starts with the man - she'll want to dig out that arrow first, and ensure that his ankle wound is cleaned and dressed before she moves on to his lesser wounds. Even though they might not look like much, when it comes to medicine it's always better to be safe than sorry!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once he's been attended to, she patches up the woman as well. The lacerations on her back give Ying pause, but soon enough she's got them bandaged up, any bleeding stopped and the wounds ready to begin the healing process. Finally, Ying has time to talk to them - she spent the entire medical procedure explaining what she was doing to them and why, calming any fears that may arise.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I like your style."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So! I'm Sunlit-Dreaming Ying. Who are you guys?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The woman, still awake: "I'm Freda. This is my husband. We're... we were just foraging, before they came."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nobody's there to see Eikichi ante the entire deck to Gatamello. Nobody's there to see each card shrivel and char one by one as if cindered by a flame invisible. No one's there to hear the bargain he lays out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Do you live around here, or...?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Freda: "...since recently, yeah. It was move up here or the mines."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Ah! We're just passing through, my friends and I. We don't know the area that well - what mines?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom raises both arms above her head. "SUN PURITY ESCALATION! KIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIII--" The towering pillar of light that marks Blossom's anima, with five dragons of pure solar light climbing ever towards the heavens, shines brighter for a moment... then collapses! From the growing, flickering sphere of energy that appears above Blossom's hands, the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> five dragons roar out, chasing down the fleeing cataphract and striking it with the Sun's fury at all unholiness!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hahaha. Praise the fuckin' Sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Freda: "We come from the coast... other side of the Hedgehog range. A fishing village."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Freda: "But there's feathersteel up in the peaks. Apparently. 's why the whole area became a, whatsit. Satrapy."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom's assault is devastating - but these things are as tough as exalts, or nearly so. Though the back of rider and dragonfly both are black and burning, the faerie knight manages to bark one more set of untranslateable orders to the remaining goblins before shrugging a shoulder hard, wheeling its mount around, and beginning an escape back into the night sky.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hobgoblins bounce off Sondok's shield like hailstones.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir redirects them with the tip of her spear, expertly puncturing them aside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Sounds complicated. Are fae attacks a frequent problem here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The last fairy knight is running, and there's not much they can do about it without Errant and Ami.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are these little idiots going to rout as well?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The hobgoblins don't seem to survive their master's abandonment. The farther the dragonfly gets, the more vague and insubstantial your feral foes become, until it's just rats and voles and fireflies that are swirling around you fearsomely before scattering into the night.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lil fuckers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With Ir's and Blossom's animas both discharged into supernatural offensive power, the three insanely lethal women find themselves lit largely by the light of the moon and stars. It'll be a walk of perhaps half an hour to get back to the Heavensward, one that'll end a little past the sroke of midnight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Ying's already being appraised of the situation. Freda: "Yes...  yes, for a long while. The further inland you go and the higher you climb... they come from above, you see. Take people away."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Freda: "But more of us have had to."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At Wern's question: "Sorry, my name's Eikichi. Just a sorcerer passing through."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Freda blinks at Ying. "...you promise? Then, then. All of you. All of you swear you're human."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Idle conversation between them, and them and you, is enough to reveal that A) faeries have been striking from the sky for basically forever, particularly around the Hedgehog mountains, and B) more and more people are being forced to live in that area and contend with the fae because the coast to the west which once hosted a number of fishing villages and farming ranges has been taken <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> over by the Realm.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first course is Midnight Eggs. You scramble four eggs for every guest with diced peppercheese, a splash of milk, and copious ground pepper, lightly salt to taste, and serve. That's fine. Then they get to sleep, while Ir fires up the oven to precook some of the boar meet while outside, she sets up a firepit and a spit. This is an old technique: Pneuman Ham, In-and-Out Style. You <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> start it in the oven, heavily rubbed and spiced, take it out to the firepit for most of the cooking, then return it to the oven for the end.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> By the time you're done you've got a perfect animal for carving, and their patients will wake up to an expansive brunch.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are people being shoved into the mines? What's the local satrap like? How bad are the taxes?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the morning, Tatsuya takes a brief glance through the notepad Ying left him - he remembers all of it, but it's still good to get an... outside view on it? A different inside view on it? This is going to give him a headache. After some brief stretches and a few practice strikes to recall his martial arts, he joins the group at brunch.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Combine that with a formidable brush salad, some more eggs -- Two-Eyed Style, this time -- and some hashed and browned potatoes, and you've got yourself a hell of a meal.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi picks at it like a bird but is very complimentary.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wern and Freda discuss the way that local fishing and farming became rapidly less profitable when put into competition with Realm imports and even with 'local' Realm operations performed with the aid of Dragon-Blooded puissance, such that more and more of the locals found themselves choosing service or mining jobs just to be able to stay afloat. Plus, the Realm's there to curtail <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the expanse of the fae - the local Wyld Hunt's an extremely literal one, and needs a lot of support from the locals to continue operating at peak efficiency, supposedly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So the upshot is that a lot of people are starving until they help to dig and drag ore, and the satrap runs the place with military exactitude, and the taxes are just going up and up with the increased needs of the Realm and the ever-bolder fae and so on. It's a hard life, and it produces a lot of refugees like these two.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi, to Ir and Blossom: "How hard did you shine last night? Should we be expecting exploratory parties from the local Hunt?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It's likely."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And it's a hard life, up here in the mountains - the fae'll swoop down to abduct you outright or pose strange challenges to you or demand choices that don't make sense. More people vanish by the month, and when they come back they're pretty and weird.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Yup."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya eats quickly and greedily, like he's making up for lost time somehow. Still, he doesn't act as though anything is amiss. "Sondok saw them from the ship. Can't imagine she was the only one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir, to Tatsuya: "Hey there, sunshine. Nice to see you again."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Not that Ying's not cool."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It was a long night. You remember everything?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir could use a trip to market, honestly. She's burned through quite a bit of their egg reserve in her exuberance.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You know what she should do, is make some bread. She'll need flour for that, though...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Father a brewer, mother a chef. Both Citywatch. Odd, maybe, that she went so hard into performing, but she learned their lessons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "It's good to be back." To Eikichi: "I think so. There's no gaps, at least. Seems like it was a success."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Good. You feeling okay?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, if you need supplies, you can always hit the markets to the west...!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Never better." He grins, light and easy. "Well, okay, maybe not NEVER better. But I feel pretty good."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Alright..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Is something the matter?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If the Solars have questions about the local situation - the area's history, the nature of the fae, the nature of the Realm occupation on the coast - they're free to ask or otherwise investigate.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's bored now. He'll go off and work on other stuff and let the others interrogate the refugees.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He doesn't ignore Tatsuya's question but he doesn't really answer it either.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Those don't really sound like questions Ir is interested in. She is, however, interested in whether she can barter for some more eggs, sugar, and other essentials to replenish the cooking stores that don't involve raw meat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are a number of refugee communities in and around the hedgehog mountains which are doing their best, but it's really hard to sustain yourself when you haven't got both a coastline and a lot of open fields to work off of. Eggs Ir will definitely be able to barter for if she approaches the right settlements, but good freaking luck with grains of basically any kind.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the satrapy itself there's a thriving market for all sorts of goods, both finished food and raw cooking materials certainly included, but that would mean marching right into what's like 40% a Cathak military base and hoping they'll take your coin. And they might! If they don't recognize you.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are also rumors that the fae have their own grand market, up in the sky.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A Cathak military base?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh yeah, this is a House Cathak joint, apparently.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Pfah! Bread is poison. Eggs, dairy, spices, salt. That's what they need right now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll find flour elsewhere.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom grunts as she eats. "There's something up with the beachhead. Going for all the feathersteel they can get makes sense, but they shouldn't need to fortify that much unless there's something deeper going on."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, eggs and probably salt can probably be traded for with the people living in and around these mountains, but if you want real spices or a proper selection of herbs and other greens you'll need a better selection. In terms of pure survival, though, you can definitely get along on simple hunting, foraging, and water condensation indefinitely.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah well. Simple living is hearty living.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "We could investigate. Although we've already drawn their attention... might be difficult to do quietly."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir shrugs. "I'm fine with being loud."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Not like we haven't been tracked all the damn way down here."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He shrugs. "True. I'd still prefer quiet, but I suppose that's a luxury at this point."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "We probably haven't, actually. There's been enough cloud cover and enough empty tundra that the best the global Wyld Hunt is likely to have is 'somewhere south of Crystal'."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So - that's the situation the squared circle finds itself in. Cathak to the west, the fae to the... up? ... and feathersteel beneath their feet. We'll learn what response this demands from our heroes, if any... next week.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir shrugs again. "If that elemental knew enough about us to figure our position, I'm not enthusiastic that, say, Yara's friends have lost track of us."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, helping clean up after breakfast: "So why did you need a demon lawyer?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Huh? Oh. I need a publicist."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Well, needed. We've got one now."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "What's he publishing?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Things I write. Propaganda. If-and-when you start recollecting or writing new holy texts, those too."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'm working on a dramatic serial novelization of our adventures! amongotherprojects"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom gently dries her hands and clears her throat. "Let me seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "I guess I could show you the first chapter. It ends with us meeting Berg and Ir."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir, of course, is at the big sink basin that drains out off the side of the ship, doing the damn dishes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She snort-laughs at that.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What perspective is it written from? How does Eikichi describe himself?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's written third-person, but it follows Tatsuya and Eikichi around, at least in the first chapter. Eikichi identifies himself here as 'The Golden Hand's eager advisor, called 'Shosei''. He's described alternately as 'boyish', 'meekly dressed', and 'deferent'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Same question, but for the other solars.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You mean like 'the rakish and renowned gentleman thief Tatsuya, the Golden Hand' or 'the faithful man-mountain with an icewalker's bearing who calls himself 'Bergsveinn'' or 'the taciturn and mysterious rider - who speaks in liquid alto and gives her name as 'Ir' with all bluntness of an elbow to the ribs'?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's everyone, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not everyone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Who does that leave? Is there someone else? Someone who might've been introduced as 'their devastating interlocutor - a woman with all the dignity and training of a Blooded Dynast and all the unshakeable resolve and righteousness the Sun loves best'? Someone who might be described as 'so ensorceling the lovestruck Shosei that he finds himself stumbling into the habits of a younger <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> man, a man who hadn't yet escaped the fear and trembling all mortals raised at the heart of the Realm learn to navigate the wants and wiles of their betters'? Someone who might be said to 'move with invincible confidence', 'speak so plainly that one suspects she thinks her truths self-evident', or 'give her name with the simple conviction that all will remember it'?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does he stumble over any of that, reading it aloud to Blossom as she lies face down on his bed, head propped up in her hands, kicking her feet?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Don’t show up without a tuxedo. Actually - you could, but you’d have to get past the ushers and security checking everyone at the door. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not a problem for Clinton Cavanaugh. When he pulls up -- is there car service?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The women don't have to wear tuxes, right? This isn't some mass remake of that Eurythmics video?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> K. J. Valentine wakes angry, which is not normal. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There is, and they don’t. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She opens her eyes in tune with the sunset, that's fine - sits up as fresh as the day she died, looks in the mirror, can't see anything but she knows she's looking good. None of that is the problem.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then Clinton steps out of his Lexus and hands the attendant his keys looking crisp, fresh, and alive -- sharp angles and rosy cheeks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Normally she'd catch a show or two before grabbing a ride to the ballet; tonight she's got to do a bit of research instead, look into the latest smartphone vulnerabilities and review this brochure from Crook & Cross International. All of that is also OK. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Laguna Beach has an excellent dry cleaner's just down the street from his and Kayleigh's townhouse.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...He didn't come from there, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What has the Lord of Anaheim upset, muttering herself into a strapless dress and deciding she'd better Uber instead of drive because she'd just start yelling at the other people on the road - it's the circumstances.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No, he came from the mansion -- the official estate of Baron Laguna -- where he is considering, in a strange move for both a Gangrel and a finance bro, putting in a library.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then when Cora hands the car off to the valet, a pinched little man in a neat tuxedo gets waved in, flanked by two slightly taller women with curly dark hair and round faces. It gives the impression of a father out with his daughters, or some rich old asshole with A Type. Bystanders' looks just go right through him; Wilson Frost believes so strongly that he doesn't care what anyone <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> thinks of him that sometimes it's even true.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's not going to do her best work under this kind of pressure. Being kicked upstairs is one thing, but the threats? Unnecessary. This is how you give an ally a grudge. What was Murray thinking? Is it a culture fit thing?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The uber is late. He fumbles the directions, they drive in circles a bit. He gives the guy a five-star review out of sympathy. Tommy steps onto the curb in an ill-fighting suit and gets the door for Clarabelle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He pats himself down for any stray tags he might've missed.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's got the kind of features that make a young man look old; the skin and eyes and mouth of an older man, a hairline that'd have been gone entirely if he'd lived to 30. But he still looks so much younger than he is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And now it's fucking raining.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Presbyter Vincent steps onto the curb, in her flowing, dark blue evening gown. It’s the first time he’s ever seen her outside her usual clerical blacks. “Thank you, Deacon. Are you feeling alright?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ arrives at the venue well ahead of time, but alone apart from an umbrella. She's in no mood to take in a performance.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clinton Cavanaugh is among the first ones to arrive. He's been dreading this night, but with a certain degree of impatience. Anticipation, even. Dread? No, not really. He doesn't think Bren will show his face at a ballet, and even if Burne does...well. They're both adults.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will definitely accept an usher taking him to...wherever they're all being gathered, and keep an eye out for Leisurely.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But it's sixty-forty odds she's not even going to show.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's what his gut says, at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You two going to be alright in the cheap seats?" Baron Hollywood asks his retainers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We'll miss the company," says Cora, the junior of the two. She both is and looks a little younger than her counterpart, wearing a shimmering navy dress that she got on clearance last summer and hasn't had a chance to wear yet.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "N-yeah." He's stuffing his tie into the front of his suit. "Nervous energy."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You going to be alright in the box?" says Nora, who managed to carry a phone, a purse, a tablet, and the first laugh-lines of middle age into this opera house and its lend-lease immortality.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Don't worry about me," says Wilson. "I live for these parties."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle straightens his tie. “Don’t worry. It’s just a performance.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frost waves the ladies off. "Go on, mingle. Enjoy yourselves. Text me if you find a bomb."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In his mind, Baron Laguna is going over his responsibilities. He's fed Shots and Honey, checked in with Rush and Buchanon; they'll all keep for the rest of the night. Kayleigh knows not to expect to see him until they have a late dinner tomorrow night -- breakfast for him, really, but even when he was alive he liked eating breakfast food at the end of the day and pizza at the beginning, <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> so unlife has treated him fairly well on that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ waves herself past a doorperson in what isn't quite a snap. ..Of course she exudes a radiant aura of supernatural fascination, so it's easy to forgive that sort of thing. The young woman in gray is at the height of fashion, has a kind of exotic beauty which is only heightened by the sparkle to her eyes, et fucking cetera.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Leisurely is waiting in the large antechamber they’ve been ushered into. Her cornflower yellow hair has been combed and brushed and set up with pins and blue ribbons. She’s wearing a far nicer dress than Cav knew she possessed. It’s the first time he’s ever seen her with eyeliner, foundation, and lipstick. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Deacon Saldana exhales, nods. "Hoo yeah, okay." Say something nice about the dress, asshole! "Ready?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When he left Laguna, the flock was quiet...but he's started to feel antsy and unsettled whenever he spends too much time away from Laguna. He wonders how other Shepherds deal with that. It startled him, a few months back, to realize he'd never seen either Alicia or Peter actually keep a flock.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Well then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “After you,” replies the Presbyter. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Leisurely: "Visionary. You look fantastic." It's a compliment, but the detached, formal sort required of a man of high standing to a woman of high standing. They're in Invictus space, now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He escorts Presbyter Vincent in out of the rain. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Thank you, Clinton.” The ushers have gone back out to fetch more people. “Of course, here it’s just Leisurely. Or Miss Foster. No titles necessary.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well. That goes against all his instincts. Titles are easier to remember for him than names, somehow. He won't be forgetting her's, however. "As you wish, Leisurely."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, whatever. Get over it. Who's around? Anyone friendly, anyone KJ needs to politely entitle, anyone from what she thinks of as 'the cohort'..?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ushers seem to tell who They are instinctively - instead of going with the rest of the crowd filing into the rows, a velvet rope is unclasped and taken away, and they’re led down the hallway beyond. The room they’re led into is large enough to hold 20, with benches and couches - and two doors lay beyond. Box 30 and 31. The later arrivals will see a handsome young man and a slightly older woman, the latter looking vaguely more <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> uncomfortable than the former. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh - hey - it’s Wilson!/Oh - hey - it’s KJ! <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They must have gotten the same invitation. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav sees Presbyter Vincent arrive, flanked by a horrible looking man. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav won't sit. He finds himself restless in situations like these.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will, however, head over to greet Clarabelle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "They got those little shramps here I wonder."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She looks tired, even in her finery. “Baron Laguna. You’re looking well.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Presbyter Vincent. You look stunning this evening." He'll greet her in whatever way is customary for the court this season. Hopefully it's not kissing the hand like they're in a damn Jane...Hou...like they're in Pride and Prejudice. New York's formality was so cloying.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *You're<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll turn to Clarabelle's companion, Jesus Christ, right, he's used to Nosferatu and knows it would be rude to let anything show on his face -- and wait a brief moment to see if he'll be introduced.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Of all the friendly faces to come across tonight.. well. Not a friendly face, but<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ moves across the room trailing suppressed emotions. "Wilson Frost, out on the town!" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They do not have shramps, little or otherwise. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, once the girls are gone Wilson reaches into his pocket. They didn't want him to drink tonight but he bargained them down to 'show up sober'. No reason he has to leave that way. He's one of the first people up into the box waiting room - oh shit, look who it is. "Anaheim's never looked so good. How are you, Baron?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Did you not bring a movie star date?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If they’re not distracted by frustration or nervousness, they’ll all shortly realize that for whatever reason, their Beasts are being unnaturally suppressed. It makes the meeting and greeting much easier, without the feeling of fear and hatred flaring up in their minds every time they see someone new. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I figured I'd just make one while I was here. How's business?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Cavanaugh," the Deacon shows some teeth with his smile, tries not to. "Nice. Real nice." Extends a hand. Shakes for what is either too short or far too long. "Lucky run-in. We gotta talk later- not here though, gotta keep business outta your social life, yeah."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah. The church grows. Cav will offer a hand to shake. "Pleasure, Deacon. I look forward to working with you. I have an...understanding, with the Sanctum." He pauses. "With elements of the Sanctum. Given that I am steward of the highway into town from San Diego, I am perhaps a bit more perspicacious when it comes to visitors on my territory than others might be."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He smiles, slightly squinting. "But we're all on the same team here, right?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Actually really good. Turns out it's so easy to find people in the area around Disneyland? And running things properly is something you can delegate. No wonder we get titles."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Like, before the area was split up for Frances and I apparently they used to call it 'the Rack'. I asked what that meant and, well, fair enough."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "And hell. Business is my social life."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The grin widens. "Good. Good. I have a feeling we'll get along just fine, Deacon." He lets the handshake go and turns to Clarabelle. "Enjoy your evening, Presbyter. Deacon."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll head over to where he left Leisurely, unless she's wandered off.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "It's a good racket. You got Angel Stadium on your beat too, yeah? Baseball season's coming up. Excellent real estate."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy slicks back his hair and plucks his phone from his pocket and furtively googles 'perspicacious'. This takes a few tries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It takes KJ a moment to realise what's going on with what she likes to think of as her unwelcome visitor. (Replaced the monthly one, see). Ever since mastering* Obfuscate she hasn't had much of a problem around other vampires, but now they're not bothering her in return.. interesting. Notable. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok comes back in with a blanket and a hot water bottle. "She thinks she's not allowed up on the main decks."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> "If you're going to hurl, please do so away from me. I just cleaned this."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a surprising scene they come across, once they make it belowdecks.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'm not even that drunk...!" Sondok follows a staggering Eikichi and Tatsuya down belowdecks. Usagi's room is beside the makeshift stables where Errant and Ami rest. Eikichi opens the door and sees "Blossom?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "..."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok presses her lips together.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh, hello." Blossom levers herself off her knees. "What's all this?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya drains the last little bit of the "fire ball" he'd been neglecting to sober up. "Wanted to clear up a misunderstanding. Do you, uh." There's no way to make this not sound sleazy. "Do you come here often."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi, obviously drunk: "They want me to tell Usagi she's not imprisoned in her room.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Usagi hides behind Blossom's legs.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Which I'm not."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom crosses her arms and scowls at Eikichi. "Now look, you've scared her! Be nice."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Survey says?" He's looking at Sondok and Usagi.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Usagi: "What about when you said that the next time you see me poking around the essence reactor you'll personally show me the inside of it?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Eikichi."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Usagi: "So anywhere as long as you're not around?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Usagi does an elaborate salute, crossing her arms over her chest and folding her hands back so they form a diamond shape with her forearms. "Right away!"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot_&gt;</b>&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Sure. Thanks." He looks a little woozy. "Glad you made me drink that water earlier. I'd be way worse off without it."<br>

Oh, a few of them are up there, but most of them cluster well below the point of dangerously thinning air and cloud cover that serves climbers as fog, and not a one of them floats or spews lava. What's more notable is the depth and diversity of the ravines and hollows between <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the mountains, some of which are idyllically grassy valleys but many more of which are mist-choked bogs or dark chasms with no apparent bottom.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the west, like a creeping mold, a network of encampments and cartrails and mine entrances denote the beginnings of House Cathak's mining operations. To the east, the Hedgehog slopes down into scrubland and savannah, neither of which are particularly bountiful now in the approach of winter. Somewhere above, you're told, live the fae - and though the Heavensward is only parked around <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the north edge of the whole area, keen observers who wander the deck at sunrise or noon might detect a strangely vibrant golden-pink cast to the southern sky.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Heavensward could actally do a pretty comprehensive survey of the range if they wanted to, but unless someone has insisted Ir's kept the ship tightly moored while she tries to buff out some of the scratches left by the wind dragon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wern and Freda have offered to lead you to their 'holler' (it took a few tries before you understood what they meant) if you so choose, although it sounds like it's deep enough between two mountains that you won't be able to just park the Heavensward on top of it. Otherwise, they'll have simply taken off, wildly grateful but still uneasy in your presence.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You've been warned neither to climb too high nor wander too deep - monsters sometimes rise from the bogs.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's going to put a surprised Sondok in the Stormwind Rider with him and go aloft looking for the rakshastan.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will head out to the vill -- the, uh, holler, and she'll do it with Wern and Freda in tow so they don't get themselves into anymore trouble.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom is up before anyone else except perhaps Sondok. Before Eikichi leaves, she'll quietly take Sondok aside and ask her, if it looks like Eikichi's getting into more trouble than he can handle at the rakshastan, to toss him in the Stormwind Rider and take them both back to the Heavensward.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok nods and puts a claw on Blossom's shoulder, and then squeezes a little too hard for it to be comforting.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But before all that, the Squared Circle and their guests probably wake to Blossom cheerfully singing a tongue-twister song Eikichi remembers from back home: "Pasiap is a dragon with a 'Pa' / If he pa-ly crosses the Pa-nkara Pass / He may get prickly and puffy from all the pa-li, but / Now he got it, he hits like an avalanche!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will be up soon after, yawning real loudly as she wanders out of the workspace with the still and puts the empty bottle of whiskey in the bin for reuse later, then stows her old six-string behind the bar. Then she's firing up their ranges and clearing space on their countertops; their guests are leaving today, and she plans on sending them home with something to remember the <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Time to make some brisket.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Daana'd is a dragon with a 'Da' / if she da-ly crosses the Da-nkara Pass / She may get dejected and defiant from all the da-li, but / Now she got it, she hits like a torrent!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Unconsciously, unintentionally, you learn / this song by heart, it's unavoidable / When that happens, sing and let someone else hear it / and you will forget it quickly..."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Aaaaaa<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's in the kitchen only briefly, but once their guests announce their intentions, and he gets a real good look at 'em, he announces that he'll be taking a day off, and will be retiring to his room early.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's sorting and storing wild fruits, vegetables, berries, what looks like meat from small animals... evidently she went out foraging bright and early and came back with a decent bounty.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's really hard for Wern to believe that Blossom was able to find that many eggs and edible mushrooms and whatnot in such a small area and in so short a timespan, but, well, you are all demons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This brisket is actually going so well that her small test batch is already done, so she's turned it into breakfast (along with some hashed and sauteed tubers) and brings a plate around to everyone after the real stuff goes into the oven. The good news about this stuff is it reheats so well as long as you get the sauce right that it's pretty perfect for preparing on the ship and then <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> taking out there, and it doesn't take anything fancy to make, tools-wise.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We super aren't! Wow, I thought we had this already proven!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is Eikichi watching Blossom openly, or hiding, or heading to the galley...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's not hiding. He's just standing there with a big goofy grin on his face.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Eikichi! You're finally up!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...did you sleep?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Of course! And then I woke up again, and have been getting many things accomplished. I just took Wern out foraging for an hour or so while Ir made breakfast."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You've proven you're not faeries! Demons can lie.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, so can the fae, but in particular demons can swear and not mean it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi leans in to kiss her on the cheek. "Oh! That reminds me, I was going to put together some first aid kits for them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's not too much longer when Sunlit-Dreaming Ying makes her way down to breakfast and begins chomping away. She gives the appropriate thank-yous to the chefs, but otherwise just mostly seems really hungry.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A couple of hours later he sees them off with small travel packs with a white cloth pinned to them, a red cross painted on each cloth with a calligraphy brush. After that Eikichi's about ready to take Sondok up to look for the rakshastan with Sondok, via the Stormwind Rider.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everyone headin' out, then? Or at least, everyone who's headin' out, headin' out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once Ir's got the brisket packed up in saddlebags and has done the dishes, yeah. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom does ask Ir and Ying to hold up a bit, so she can spend a few hours drawing a circle in the soft dirt, improvising scriptures commanding the Essence of the earth to rise up and offer its service, chanting in Old Realm, and so on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's Blossom calling forth and what's she tellin' it to do?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying agrees! She spends most of the time meditating, trying to draw something out, or checking around the area for discarded bows. She really needs to pick one of those up for emergencies.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> An earth elemental, one of the least variety - she's going to ask it to find and bring back a deposit of native copper. Not much, just a few dozen ponzes worth.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soon enough, a lil' fellow that looks like a Xuanwu turtle made of rough dirt coalesces out of the ambient Essence of the area.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Aww.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is it gonna stick around for the year, or is it free to return to the earth once it's accomplished its task?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's got time. She'll discuss the nitty-gritty of how the people in the holler salt their meat with Wern and Freda to pass the time, and offer some tips if she thinks they need them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's free to disperse into Essence flow or continue to exist as an independently-willed being on its own once it's finished that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying listens to Ir and the gang talk. She's got to learn more advanced cooking techniques than just winging it and hoping for the best, after all.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It chirps at you, then, and leaps gracefully into the air before burrowing straight into the ground at Blossom's feet. Whee!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Ha! I was worried that would be hard."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "It wasn't?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So at this point it's like, Usagi holding down the fort, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok'll stay. Eikichi will be fine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Seems reasonable.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Famous last words.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying gives both Eikichi and Sondok a hug before she leaves. "Stay safe, both of you," she tells them, seriously. "Or else I'll haunt you. I'll find a way to do it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "It'll be fine. I'll bring everyone back a present."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Don't eat anything!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, Eikichi has quite a trip ahead of him, because while the Stormwind Rider is incredibly fast, it doesn't actually fly that high. Unless the rakshastan the sorcerer seeks is a mere two or four stories off the ground, he won't be able to just sail on up there on his own; his best bet is to follow the exact opposite of Wern and Freda's advice, skating along the highest mountains <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> he can find and looking for trouble at their peaks. He'll probably want to stay in the center of the Hedgehog, too, maybe leaning eastwards, since you'd assume the Cathak are handling things themselves somehow.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah. Eikichi assumes that there must be some way to access the rakshastan without flying directly up to it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "A cool gift for me would be no more shitheads from a past life."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, the rest of the circle, and the circle's two guests, have a much glamorous trip ahead of them. They go hiking off into the brush, taking a series of circuitous paths around the mountains that prevent them from drifting either too high or too low. Lots of sun-dappled fallen leaves, dry branches crunching underfoot, and glimpses of probably-dangerous wild fauna out of the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> corners of the eye await them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Can Errant and Ami manage it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "That's not a present! That's a past!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ami, yes, since Ami seems to not notice the grade of the slope she's on and can just walk right on top of the fallen leaves that occasionally obscure dangerous pits in the ground or whatever. Errant will need some skilled handling.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the solars travel, they're given to rack their brains and organize their thoughts with regards to the fae. I'm not sure if Blossom and Eikichi have read the exact same scrolls, but they're largely appraised of the same information, and are able to educate their allies unless for some reason they choose not to.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wow. Fucked up that no one capable of that is currently riding Errant, with all her awesome brisket.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Errant's a good boy and handles the terrain damn well. Helps that Ir gets the feeling he's taking this bird's agility as something like a challenge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Vulnerability to iron, an appetite for strong emotions or personality traits, a total susceptibility to but irresistible fascination with formal oaths and promises - everyone knows and can confirm that stuff. What's a little harder to get across but, perhaps, more important to understand is the underlying metaphysics of the fae and the raksha, and what that might mean for humans <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> who'd fight or entreat with them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Fae are 'naturally' immaterial, but in a way not even barely analogous to the way that gods and demons are. It's not that the same creature might either be corporeal or incorporeal - it's that a faerie is by default a bodiless vortex of wyld energy that flatly cannot survive in creation.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Of course! There's a lot to do every night - read reports, keep up with the troops, donate blood. Take blood donations. Study ('isn't it 2013'? come on.), patrol.. and give Baron Hollywood a call. All this while looking good. Maybe some kind of thicker blouse, in case it rains again. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also: learn to shoot, have these bullets looked into, um.. right, embed an exploit on her Twitter profile.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Someone does, quickly. “Yeah, hello-“ It’s Sauer herself. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's initial routine is just to head downstairs, out the back of her house across the alley and to the office. One of those small commercial buildings which used to be a Pizza Hut before it was a Kinko's before it was a Papa John's. There's a couple of ghouls and less-haemologically-empowered employees there doing correspondence, taking reports from people in the field. Such as they are, such as it is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There’s a knock on the basement door. It’s the signal, as it’s been the past few months since he’s been living there, that Soria has left a pile of freshly laundered clothes for him in a wicker basket on the steps past the door. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Presbyter Sauer," comes Wilson's voice, slightly crackly through the telephone. "It's Wilson. Is this a bad time?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Thanks." This is interesting. Tess Okienka was a bit less.. vivacious than the rest of Jessie's circle, but she did appreciate films.. KJ will dictate a reply, because this is the 1920s or something and that's how you do it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy stumbles out the door to catch the departing Soria. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He picks her up outside her apartment -- a cozy place down the street from the surf shop, up on the third floor. There aren't that many buildings with more than three stories in Laguna. He parks on the curb and gets out, texting her that he's outside, and just leans back against his Lexus and appreciates the gathering night.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The priest turns. “Huh? Oh. Don’t worry about it, Thomas. Just one more chore.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “Just a busy one. What can I help you with?” <br>

He coughs, leans against the doorframe, tries to flatten out his tie. The nosferatu puffs his cheeks, nods. "Pretty good I think. You know this Cav guy?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He smiles when she steps out the door onto the sidewalk, short blonde hair swept back and still a bit wet from...the shower? The surf? She's wearing a black dress he's seen on her before. He wouldn't forget that. "Hi."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "He's going to try to do some legal bull-shit to buy us some time to find Sp- Souza."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He glances back down at the basket. "Really though, you don't gotta- look, as soon as I get some money I'll cover my own costs."<br>

"You look--" She cuts him off with a kiss. She knows. And honestly, Cav's compliments don't have the most variety to them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He opens the passenger-side door for her, walks around to get back behind the wheel, and they're off into the night.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway. It's a good thing most of the manorial duties are handled because this next part of the job KJ has to do personally. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She jaunts(? it sounded better when dictating) back across the street, locks the door, connects to the secure room through various VPNs and starts messing with Metasploit.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Instead of music, Kayleigh turns the Lexus's radio -- well, the satellite radio device that Cav's installed -- to KLAA, the radio affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Who're they playing?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kay: "Fucking Rangers, man."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "They winning?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer takes a moment to respond. “Let me check my calendar.” He can hear her moving papers around, and muffled talking in the background. Eventually: “I’m a bit pressed for time in the immediate future, Baron, but if it doesn’t inconvenience you, I’m at Presbyter Vincent’s office doing some work. I can meet you here.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kay: "The Angels?" She laughs.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She gives it. “Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. I’ll be at this number.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Now, Richards, he had the great year last year, right? Is he really the ace now?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kay sighs. "Well, it's either him or Weaver, right? And don't get me wrong, Weaver's great, but. You know. He's getting a little old, maybe."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soria: “I’m meeting with Deacon Garra.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav grins and shrugs. "Well, you know. I try." He also checked the roster on his phone while he was waiting for her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Thank you very much.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They spend the rest of the ride listening to the game and talking baseball (to the best of Cav's ability), and then how her day was (busy, kinda crappy) and how her school's going (undergrad, a couple years late, still a part-time student).<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cora: "Really?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It'd almost give KJ some sympathy for the illiterates and displaced professions, but, get this: she's doing it while also running a vampire barony.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "--So right now, I'm sort of looking at my options.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So. Who's the best gossip she knows?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kayleigh's encouraging and attentive, but doesn't press too much about the scheduling.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soon, they've arrived. To Cav's relief, he did, in fact, remember to get the reservations like his notes said.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A ghoul comes bearing a phone call for KJ. “For you, Baron.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The offices of Presbyter Vincent are a shabby apartment next to a junior college and an upscale shopping mall. At least it’s gated. Wilson’s Lincoln looks a bit out of place compared to the old Toyotas and Hyundais that inhabit the parking lot. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Where's the restaurant at?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It does, so Wilson will tell Cora to take the car and ride around and he'll call her when the meeting's over. How's the weather tonight?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ was just about to call Jessie Campbell.. maybe her luck's turned? "Anaheim here."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The appetizers are excellent, and service prompt and knowledgable, and the wine fantastic. They order the jalapeño fettucine with chicken, tomatoes, and black beans while talking about the best Italian food they've ever had. Cav's got a place on the Lower East Side he's stumping for, while Kay says there's a place in Anaheim they have to check out some other night.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clear skies and a cold moon. <br>

Doesn't do shit- he can't spare the blood for it- but he's hoping some sort of psycho-somatic whatever will help ease his nerves.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The voice on the other end of KJ’s line sounds around her age. “Baron, this is Santiago Aguilar, Baron Modjeska’s personal secretary.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Cav looks away from his girlfriend to glance down at his phone, he's able, through sheer effort, to keep the smile on his lips.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kay: "...What's up?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He sighs. "The office.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Santiago: “The Baron is still resting from her last night out. But we’d be happy to entertain you tonight. Or at your earliest convenience.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It's fine," she says, and she means it. This is far from the first time this has happened, and he's never lying about the phone calls being short.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Oh, you're the 'we' from the card. Yeah, I'd love to come over!" If it was a few hours ago she might have declined.. but there aren't any emergencies, and meeting new people is a good idea for all sorts of reasons right now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav makes it out onto the sidewalk before the smile slips into a near-fangbaring growl. He reaches out. Is this motherfucker nearby? Is he being watched? Can he feel any vampires, any predators, in the streets of Laguna around him?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Santiago laughs. “Yeah. She hasn’t started using the royal we. Yet. Okay. I’ll send over the address and keep the gate open.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> While he does that, he won't text back -- he'll call.<br>

My real number's (xxx) xxx-xxxx.. if Modjeska's where I think it is I should be under an hour?" Thankfully they're on the right edge of the city, and it's late. Heck, it's always late.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nobody meets Wilson out in the parking lot.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There a bell then? Wilson'll call if there's no bell.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tweet as many times as you can on a long drive, content optional in the case of avoiding accidents.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "How are you doing it? Ghouls? Remote viewing? Are you following her? "<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Yeah, it was on the GPS. How's tricks, Presbyter?" Is she inviting him in? What's the place like on the inside if so?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “Are you…outside? You can just…knock…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Shortly after, she opens the door to the “office.” He can see why the scare quotes are used when he steps in. It’s a series of desks in a small living room, connected to a kitchen that’s full of boxes and papers, and a tiny bed crammed into a corner. Clarabelle is hunched over, writing. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's certainly disciplines, blood magics that could be surveiling him and Kay right now -- the vampires wouldn't have to be in Laguna to use them, and Cav would be none the wiser. But what makes no sense is texting him to taunt about it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Was there no bell?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav's not quite thinking straight at the moment, though. He told this asshole he'd be busy. This was date night!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Whatever. Wilson does whatever gets the door open.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Has KJ ever been out in the canyons? The backwoods of Orange County? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "I was looking for a bell. It's been a while since I just knocked on somebody's door." Like... forty years? Probably around there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's been over them, like in a plane. Otherwise, no. The hills are nice but that's because they've still got people.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer closes the door behind him and climbs onto a pile of boxes tall enough so that while sitting on it, she’s roughly his standing height. “Not a lot of creature comforts out here. But that just means fewer distractions. How can I help you, Baron?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "What the fuck are you talking about, man?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the roads become less and less congested, and the lights of the cities begin to disappear, the wide curves of the hills rise to embrace KJ. The land turns from concrete and stucco to wood and soil. The trees form a canopy over her head with their thick boughs. If she rolls her windows down, she’ll smell the soft and cool earth scented by eucalyptus and oak. <br>

She can see the Baroness sitting on the porch, wrapped in a shawl, sitting next to a man in his 20s. “Just park in the driveway,” she calls. When the engine cuts out, the only sound is that of crickets. It’s colder out here. The smells and sounds are different. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson blinks. "Presbyter Vincent, hello. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Now my understanding is that this is being resolved by the Judex. Obviously Lord Bren is the aggrieved party, and since the incident was in Baron Cavanaugh's territory I'm sure you've got his attention too. But do you have a formal advocate from the covenant yourselves? Who's representing the Parish?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav will return at 2 AM, having left Kay dozing in their bed -- something else she's gotten used to. He hasn't put his tie back on, leaving the top few buttons of his dress shirt undone, but he's otherwise dressed in his usual black slacks and jacket.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll park a couple streets away and walk the rest on foot. He should be able to feel Tommy approaching, if he's not already there.<br>

KJ rolls up the window - in case of birds - and steps out, away from the little pinging noises the car makes in the cold. She ended up with a thinner dress, something that would be a bad idea out here if body temperature was still a thing. "Hey, Baroness. Mr. Aguilar, maybe Lord. Lord Secretary?"<br>

If she didn’t notice the California State Historical Landmark plaque outside, then she’ll surely think it deserves one as she looks around its Arts and Crafts interior.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It’s raining harder than ever. Even Wilson, who has lived here the longest, can’t remember a storm like this. The last week has had no let-up - every day it feels like the raindrops are growing larger, and the winds are growing stronger. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Drought's over.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the meantime, Tommy and Cav have received a tip - whether they’ll bring in their erstwhile ally or Cav’s minder before they act on it is up to them. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Cav wakes, the girls are curled up at the foot of the bed. Must be bad out there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah? What's the tip?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Franks estate.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's been put off as long as she possibly can. Retrospect! KJ peers into the mirror in her mezzanine - she's looking at her own actions, not any visual reflection. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's got to force an acquaintance with Clinton Cavanaugh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cavanaugh showers and begins to pull a suit out of the closet before hesitating and putting it back, opting for slacks and a black turtleneck. And boots, not wingtips.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The rain beating against the ceiling is unnerving.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Who does she know that he knows? Jessie's set is no good, and Helena's contacts could be worse. There's mortal stuff. Or there's Leisurely Foster and Wilson Frost.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's also the club idea.. hmm. Kill two birds with one stone?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah, if this is going to work, though, it's got to be credible.. so far she's only managed to speak to Frances. But reaching out to everyone at the same time shouldn't be too suspicious. Technically, it's something she was going to do anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy's first play is to find Soria and see if he can drum up a few people to roll out to the Franks Estate with the Deacon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Baron Valentine sits on the bed for a few more minutes, arranging the idea like an algorithm. Then she pulls on a bra and a shirt and goes to decide whether to have breakfast.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soria is upstairs, reading. “Muscle?” He looks up at Tommy, smiling uneasily. “You are all that comes to mind, Thomas.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, he drinks his blood for the night shirtless, at least. Best safeguard against spills. But he'll be fully dressed when he puts on coffee and begins perusing some books he got from Leisurely about...stuff.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy stands in the doorway, doesn't come in. "Yeah, that's what I figured."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's Tommy's ringtone?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-QD_HIfjA<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eventually, when Rush and Buchanon have been given enough time to get to work and settle in, he'll call the office and throw it on speaker.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's just started playing out of whichever pocket he keeps his phone in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Yeah.. I figured, we get enough people, get in, out fast, maybe we can- aw shit."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The conversation mainly revolves around whether he's gotten any new or interesting messages from Morse or the Judex, as well as informing them he'll be...out of office, tonight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sorry." He winces, rolls the phone up into his palm. "Yeah?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He hasn’t, and they reassure Cav that things are running smoothly without his personal involvement. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy hear's a woman's voice, clear and professional enough that it reminds him of a call from a doctor's office or something until "Good evening. I've got Baron Hollywood on the line for Mr. Saldana. Is he available to take a business call?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah well, out of office doesn't mean no personal involvement. He'll tell Rush to go into his office and, like he does many nights, forward calls to Cav's office phone to his mobile. Then he'll reach out across Laguna Beach. How's the flock feel tonight? Hopefully the rain is keeping the assholes indoors.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sure, patch 'em in." Tommy takes a ballpoint pen from his pocket along with a crumpled napkin and starts drawing. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The rain is keeping everyone indoors, is the problem. The flock is getting restless after being cooped up for so many days in a row. Not only that, but now a few more streets than usual have been closed due to landslides and flooding. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Boredom's unfortunate, but outside of a Shepherd's purview. As long as no vampires are fucking around doing home invasions he'll generally leave his people to their devices tonight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "One moment please." There's a click and a click and a voice on the line, and a man is speaking. "Mr. Saldana. Wilson Frost here. How are you tonight?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's staring forward at Soria. "Busy. What's up?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I had a chat with Presbyters Vincent and Sauer the other night. I understand you're the point man on the Souza thing."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I asked them how I could help and they gave me your number. So what do you need?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tonight, again, KJ finds herself dictating messages to gofers. Jesus christ this is primitive. Anyway, after the one million years it takes for One's People to reach out to Their People she be in a credible position to start making some calls herself. Hide a key in a forest, surveillance among social climbing?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy writes haphazardly as he speaks. "Oh yeah? Fucking awesome, do you know anyone bad ass enough to roll with us up to the Franks Estate to get Souza?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Yeah. Me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "He's up at Thomas Franks's old place?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As KJ runs through her mental checklist of potential guests for her Club for the new barony, and makes calls to that effect, she gets more interest and less resistance than she expected. She doesn’t even have to ask Frances, really - but besides that, Glover, Primrose, and Heath are all open to meeting with her informally. Wesley Fitzroy is polite enough to personally tell her over the phone that his schedule is more than a bit unpredictabl<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> - the Wilderness Commission’s work comes and goes with little notice, after all, but he’d be happy to discuss it further. She doesn’t get a response from Munoz. It just goes to voicemail. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll call Kay next, to check in and tell her good night. She's got school during the day tomorrow, if he recalls correctly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All good. She does want to get this thing off the ground - but the main purpose here is to be able to talk about what's planned.. she's not even sure why she hadn't contacted Laguna Beach yet. It's kind of too far away to remember.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then he'll go back upstairs and get the shoulder holster out of his closet...and the Glock 17 out of the gunsafe right below it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He passes the note across the table to Soria, gives a thumbs up. The napkin reads: don't worry about this i can handle it. To the side there's a a crudely drawn stick-man also giving a thumbs-up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He returns his attention to the call: "Yeah? That's- okay, that's something. Any help I can get is good enough, here. Should we discuss costs now, or...?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I won't ask what Wilson's ringtone is, since it'd really be Nora or Cora.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We got a tip Sponger's out there, yeah. Who knows if it's good, but there's only one way to know."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The phone KJ reaches at the Paramount office has a regular ringtone. "Business line."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soria looks at the note. “Hm,” is all he says. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "What's the loadout. Are we mounting up for a hunt?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy turns, waves to Soria and starts back down the stairs.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh man I hope not."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anaheim: "Valentine for Mr. Frost. That's a name, not a promise."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I think the classy move here is to bring enough people that no one rando who bumps into us wants to deal with it, and we're gone before the time it takes for him to get the whole army."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "How armed should we be?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Dunno. What've you got?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Sword."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Honestly, the different arrangements each vampire makes to keep their privacy and create a safe, buffered interface to the world - one full of cops as well as enemies and friends and targets - is something which really interests KJ. That eclectic variety of tenuous connections..<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The woman on the line, who it so happens is Nora, says: "He's on another call. Would you like me to take a message or if you hold just a minute I can put you through."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy stops, nods vigorously. "I respect that a great deal."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Alright. Where and when?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They probably discussed meeting at that bar.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's right at the mouth of the valley.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Last outpost of LA before a night in the woods.<br>

Wilson: "I'll be there." He's about to hang up when he sees another light blinking on the phone. He can't remember the last time he had two open lines on the same night. Nora sees the first line go dark and says "One moment." To Wilson: "I've got 'Valentine' on line 2." Wilson: "Suuure. Put her through."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A moment later KJ's got Wilson in her ear. "Evening, Baron."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well. "At least, I've got to find out if he sucks and invite him if not."<br>

And since most of Father’s regulars live on dirt roads, it’s enough of a challenge to even get there that they opt to drink in the comfort of their living rooms, instead. Until others arrive, Cav will just have the bartender for company. He’s happy to have a customer, and serves promptly, but the man is still as discreet and quiet as ever. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Twenty minutes later, KJ gets another call. “B-Baron Valentine?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav will signal the bartender for something cheap and domestic. It'll go on his tab.<br>

Ah, well. "Baron Fitzroy, I'm glad you rang."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He sets down and the chair creaks beneath him. "Some Invictus guy, Wilson... Frost?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The armor stays where it is, but soon the sword's nowhere to be seen either.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ gets a warning when Wilson's five minutes out. Is she ready when the Lincoln rolls up?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the doorstop of an Anaheim townhouse - somewhere between a chocolate shop and a storage center with paint peeling off old brick - there's a woman in a grey greatcoat with hair curled back into a bun, fiddling with nothing.<br>

Now, the rain has turned the whole thing into an avenue of tightly-packed mud, the Rover’s heavy tires leaving deep grooves as they inch forward, feeling it every time the tires grasp for a grip and then find it. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Outside, the rain falls harder than it has the past few hours. The road has turned into a miniature stream - they can barely see the shape of the Land Rover parked a few yards away from the front steps, and its tires are submerged a few inches in running water. The little rise in the land that the house sits on means that they’re dry, for now. Well, as dry as one can get in a pouring storm. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bad night to be making housecalls in the valley.<br>

His last words were faint, and hadn’t changed from his repeated prayer. Blood pools under him, visible even through the mud and water. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ crosses her arms, staring skeptically at the collapsing witch before her and Baron Laguna. Does the man think he can get away with babbling portentous crimes and then take the easy way out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's wrong with him, and how much forcibly administered vitae would it take to fix it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav, meanwhile, has walked to the very edge of wherever will keep him out of the rain to scan what's left of the treeline. See if there's anymore of them out there. God knows it'll be hard to hear them in this rain.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He seems to be bleeding from a terrible, tearing wound from under his arm down to his pelvis on the side of his body. Whatever ruined him had enough force behind it that it didn’t cut cleanly, or at least crushed and clawed as much as it severed. Blood runs in a dark red stream into the ground. Who knows how much he needs, or if it would help? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So is he slipping into torpor at the moment?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All of this remains unknown to the man on his hands and knees in the small, hidden tunnel under the floorboards. Wilson seems to be…somewhere. He was just ahead of Tommy when they got to the X intersection, one path leading to each upstairs room, and one vertical passageway leading down, into darkness…<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Deacon Saldana: "Jesus Christ."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He’ll be either in torpor or completely dead in a few minutes, at the rate he’s losing vitae. His Beast, faint and sluggish, confirms what should have been an easy guess, regarding his nature. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy peers down the vertical passageway. Are there, like, hand-grips, or ladder rungs? Is it just a vertical shaft with smooth walls...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As Cav looks into the rain, he can see something….part the rain, with its size. It’s a few dozen yards out, past the Land Rover, in the trees beyond the house’s clearing. It moves smoothly, back and forth, its great black bulk pacing to and fro, shaking the trunks of the trees it passes as it brushes them. It must be the source of the great piercing howl they heard. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ’s senses are a bit finer in the moment. She can hear it, place it, tell it’s not coming closer for now. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There’s a little metal ladder bolted into the hard clay soil of the shaft. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's going to shoulder the man, and press a wrist to his mouth to see if he's capable of taking advantage. It hurts. But this is an opportunity.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav will have already signaled for his cats to pull back. Looks like they won't be going back out the front, at least not for awhile.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man’s fangs reflexively sink into KJ’s wrist, and he drinks her stolen blood. She can feel the blood run through her arm into him…and pass out a few moments later. Enough stays in him so that he seems to come around, but the mindless stitching and repairing that should be taking place, isn’t. Something appears to be preventing the blood from clotting properly. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy lands on something half metal, and half soft.

If that's a werewolf out there, they're not going to be able to do much.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And if it's not a werewolf, then things are even worse.<br>

The house here is just as well-lit. Bunting hangs from railings and paper ribbons dangle from the ceiling. Punch bowls and silver serving trays stand on tables set on the side of the rooms. Around them, indistinct shadows the size of people laugh and murmur indistinctly, gathered in small groups as they would be at a party. <br>

The bookshelves in the study have been stood upright, their shelves re-ordered…but any closer examination reveals the titles on the spines remain undistinct and hazy. The shadows are chatting here, too…but he can only hear snatches and fragments, words swimming into intelligbleness for a few moments before drifting away again. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Yeah, but they're also usually constrained to one aesthetic. Fancy dinner parties don't quite fit it."<br>

It hasn't been an uneventful trip, but neither has it been a hugely taxing one; she spread the news to the fourth holler in the area and helped them ready themselves to move by rustling up some game and dislodging a boulder so that it could serve as a natural bridge; she slew some kind of giant <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> scorpion that seemed to be a straggler from a prior raid; she stumbled across a weird old hermit rumored to be living on his own in the area and gave him the skinny on what's supposed to be coming up.<br>

One's the young man in the conical hat whom she saw defending the downtrodden in a bar/teahouse off near the coast; the other's the spitting image of a wise old sage, a man with flowing white robes and flowing white hair and long, pointed ears and bright golden irises.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Tatsuya: "Willing Creation out of raw unshaped Wyld.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Xalvierre: "Defter how?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xalvierre gestures expansively. "Intrigues and secrets drive the courts of day and night both farther apart and closer together. The forces of the distant Realm encroach and immiserate.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xalvierre: "To treat the world as a canvas, or a pile of colored sand - to casually assume a continuity between what you destroy and what you conjure.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya just shrugs. Honestly, it seems like a pretty good plan to him. Simple and clean.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "We've already reshaped a city, Crystal. What makes this different?" The question is sincere. She's always wanted to debate with a wizened holy man.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Hmm... what do you make of this, then?" He shows Xalvierre the Linchpin.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom tilts her head: "You're suggesting that reducing an area of Creation to chaos, even in the service of beating back chaos, is abandoning a moral redoubt?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "The line is not clearly drawn between creation and destruction... though this is definitely, definitely destruction..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Destruction and creation in equal measure. Does it still cross the line, for you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xalvierre strokes his beard - it's a long beard, so it's a long motion to begin and complete - as he contemplates the implement that Eikichi proffers.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eeeeee! He's stroking his beard sagely!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The old man, or at least the old man-shaped creature, nods somberly to Blossom. "To fell a tree and raise a cabin... to till the soil and bring forth a harvest... all part of the workings of the world. But one cannot shape the Wyld here without first bringing the Wyld forth - and if I slew you, and dreamed up a replacement, it would come as cold comfort to your comrades."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Depends on the comrade.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi only seems to notice him again when he sits down.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson whistles and points at the gate.<br>

There's still a long strand of duct tape twisting in the wind on the barrel as he levels it at the gate. "Come the fuck on, man."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Cav gets Buchanan and Rush on the phone, he tells them to take the office phone off the hook for the rest of the night -- at least until they hear otherwise from Cav on their personal cells.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Nosferatu is quite a bit larger than the diminutive Baron Anaheim…but when he makes contact with her along his escape trajectory, he falls over into the dirt, trembling and wheezing. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy saunters over and roughly grabs the nosferatu by the back of his collar, hoisting him back up onto his knees.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ bends down. At more than 60 mph, she's left the others behind momentarily. Before the Deacon arrives, she shows the escapee something glinting in her hand. "Whatever you did, you'll be judged by merit and politics. But you can't escape the Invictus. Get used to it"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are we? Better get on with it, then.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once he's in the trunk, Shots will hop in after him, and settle down on his chest, glaring at the Nosferatu.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Yeah, just back out to Laguna."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> An hour later, in Laguna Canyon ——<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav's place is perhaps modest by some standards in these hills, but it's still a mansion -- an iron-gated and tree-lined perimeter leading up a short driveway to the front walk and imposing front doors -- the main foyer is at the intersection of two two-story wings, one stretching west towards the coast and the other north, meeting in a sort of hub area.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's in a modern American style: nondescript, not a lot of windows, some McMansion influence but with enough high quality materials and craftsmanship in the building (as well as a large enough plot of land and square-footage) to not make it feel cheap.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Shots and Honey will immediately hop out of the car and stalk off into the underbrush, leaving Cav and whoever else tagged along with a no-longer-catted Sponger Souza.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's sticking to him like glue at this point. She likes it when they try to run! But not more than once.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sponger, the fight taken out of him, follows meekly up to the doors. “What now?” <br>

"We're just going to ask some questions, really."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dull but not unpleasant. Plenty of room for 'the girls'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They'll drag him through the front door, then, and into the main foyer-space -- the floor plan for this hub area is fairly open, with stairs leading up to the second level lining either wall and a wide arch leading underneath the stairs through a kitchen and out to the backyard. It's very clean, furnished, and well-maintained, if a bit spartan. But Cav directs them down the hallway <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> on the left, into the North Wing, which more or less appears unfinished. Well. Unlived in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Then I'll write down the answers, and with enough of them everything's likely to be fine, probably."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Painted, but not furnished. He directs them into the second room on the right, which is literally just an empty white room with a hardwood floor, and a thick black tarp over the only window.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "I'll be right back."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He returns with chairs and an unassuming table.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then he pulls a charger cord for his iPhone out of a pocket, plugs it in, and sets it down on the table after tapping a few buttons. It's recording.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "April..."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He leans over to check the phone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "April 18th, 2016. Session with Sponger Souza. Baron Laguna, with Baron Anaheim and Deacon Saldana."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Where’d Wilson go? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "I guess the first thing, Sponger, is to make sure you know why we're having this conversation."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ sits on one end of the table, kicking her legs a bit. Still feels wet, like the drizzle in Santiago Canyon permeated all clothing. She's got a phone out too, tapping rather than recording.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Nosferatu looks into space, sitting at the head of the table. “Beat Cosmo Morgan within an inch of his life. Should have gone all the way. Then you would be hunting down a murderer. Killed me out there. Spared me being turned over to Bren.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy crosses his arms and slouches back into the chair. He exhales a fine mist that smells vaguely like citrus.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Where'd you do it?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cora took him home. He's had enough of other people, living and dead, for the night. For ever, really, but the ghosts can leave him alone tonight. Once they pull in to Misty Dream - a sprawling and withdrawn complex Wilson bought when a million dollars went a lot farther than it does now - he lets Nora and Cora off the hook. Since he's not injured or sleeping in the office, they call <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> it a win and go about their business. Wilson doesn't pry.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At the very least, KJ can sympathise with not being wanting to be put in the hands of Donald Bren. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's not a nice place to be, here.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson spends the evening much as he'd have spent it in the office, except instead of watching Netflix on a computer screen he's watching Doctor Zhivago in the 30-seat projector room. He fired up the popcorn popper, even - he didn't like popcorn even when he was alive, but it'll do for warmth until the rye kicks in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's got his phone on, even though he expects no calls. What's the point of having your own theater if you can't be rude in it?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ would like to know whether Clinton Cavanaugh does feel about the Orange parish!

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's phase two.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Here we go.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Showtime.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Getting into the bowels of the night court will be easy, of course, but day's trickier - it's higher in the sky than the Stormwind Rider goes. Eikichi visited last time by the grace of a couple knights willing to create a path for him, but unless you can pull that off a second time you'll have to either teleport or take the Heavensward out of all those mothballs you're storing it <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in. Or something else that hasn't occurred to me.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Besides that, if you're to successfully pull the Cathak forces into your trap, you probably need to take some pains to ensure that they at Dorsal Point realize what you are and where you're going, and see no choice but to follow.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...How the hell did mortals even get up there?!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Very carelessly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abducted, of course. The knights of the day court've got huge riding birds.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Best way to do that is to climb high on some mountain peak and... be interesting?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sigh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If she must.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So anyway, who's going where and how?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's wandering to the top of the nearest mountain peak, it seems.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi and Blossom are headed to Dorsal Point, flying as low and close as they can get and closing the distance on foot, unless Blossom had another idea.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No, that'll do. The question is, how to draw them out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's heading up the mountain with Ir.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Might be easier to answer when we get there and take the lay of the land, but if we're going to get a bulk of the Blooded out into the mountains we're going to need to present them with a situation that demands an urgent response and make that the only one they have.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll ride Errant up. Heavensward's a bit far away to stable him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "So, while we shouldn't try to be spotted on our way over, it's not necessarily a bad thing if we are."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "You think?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir and Tatsuya have a bit of a climb ahead of them, minus whatever length of ride Eikichi was willing to give. It's an arduous one, but not geomantically so - there's less compulsion to press on without breaks, less of that intangible backwards pressure they felt earlier on Xalvierre's mountain. Indeed, the climb is an increasingly refreshing one as they get higher.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a brief interruption as a small war party of pig-faced, spear-wielding creatures comes scrambling around a boulder-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The good kind of refreshing, or the Wyld equivalent of feeling warm while you're freezing to death?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Yo."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She nods. "Ideally, a harried scout would announce our presence just in time for us to collapse a mineshaft or something."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Makes sense. Where should we start?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a very, very aggressive "Yo," accompanied by a piercing stare and Ir leaning forward on her horse, Iscariot laid menancingly in spear form across her lap.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's the beginnings of a 'you idiots! we've ALL got spears-' moment until the moblins actually notice what they're dealing with. Then they're rapidly replaced with roughly humanoid dust clouds.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> -scrambling around a boulder, but otherwise the trip is positively bracing. Indeed, once the treeline's behind you and a picturesque, lichen-dusted peak ahead, you can practically see the daytime court itself. From below, it's an agglomeration of huge, fluffy clouds backlit by honey-golden sunlight. The sky's a riot of blue, gold, and pink and there's a part of you that could just <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> lie back and admire this forever.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's pretty, alright. Almost too bad about what they're going to do to it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Almost.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Eikichi and Blossom are whirling across the Hedgehog, skating 'round the peaks and valleys so that in their journeys they only come across the occasional mortal foragers or mutated beasts. Either/or doesn't trouble them, of course - few things can reach as high as the stormwind rider and fewer still have any hopes of keeping pace with it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Tatsuya: "Pretty, right? Don't believe it. It's fucking with your head."<br>

Prospects look good, actually, for anyone crazy enough <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> to want to goad the Cathak into confrontation in the next few days.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It looks like several contingents of forces have mobilized from the base at Dorsal Point and either made or are currently making their way across the plains to the Hedgehog proper. It looks, too, like several mineshafts already benefit from increased military presence. This doesn't include the one you already hit, but then, that one wasn't turning up the results the Cathak were <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi and Blossom know from the maps they stole from Calza that there are three other major mineshafts being sunk by Cathak's mercenary sorcerers and engineers. One of them is too high up and too far north on the Hedgehog to credibly be searching for a sunken defense grid pylon - one presumes that they actually did find a good feathersteel deposit there and decided to capitalize <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> on it. The other two are deeper and more central, and either or both might be getting the Cathak where they want to go. Judging from tracks, wagon trails, and troop movements, both are being reinforced.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi espies, as he surveys the land, the glint of a spyglass catching sunlight - and is quick enough to simply pop the stormwind rider back down below the treeline.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It is a question, though, how the two of them mean to cause full-on mine collapses or whatever.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "They're well-prepared," Eikichi whispers to Blossom. There's nobody around for a hundred yalms at least but still. "Both mines are guarded."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How can we get them to evacuate the mines?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Before long, Ir and Tatsuya - both, by virtue of stubborn resolve, proof against the wyld's temptations - have reached the end of the path they're climbing and set up station around the peak. In fact, Ir's impromptu performance ensures that 'long' doesn't even arrive before the fae do. Ir and Tatsuya both hear what sounds like some sort of commotion farther down on the mountain <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (squawking, gibbering and growling, screams and poof-ing noises) before a pair of gold-clad knights come flapping up into view on huge, maroon-colored birds.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom knows that mines are evacuated in the event of disaster of some sort or another - poisonous gas, monster attack, and so on. The Cathak aren't going to care very deeply for the locals they've conscripted and handed pickaxes, of course, but if conditions deteriorate to the point that workers are just going to die without even digging anything up there's no reason to keep 'em <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Hmm. The problem here is, they might decide to deliberately keep the miners down there in order to prevent us from collapsing the shafts."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When they arrive, Ir's playing a suitable tune on her now-fiddle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUCbKYKkDis<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi presses his lips together. "They're using unskilled conscripts and sorcerers to staff this project, right?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So if we can drive off the sorcerers, disrupt the spells, maybe destroy their elementals, then we won't need to collapse the shafts outright as long as we can present enough of a sense of urgency that trying to re-establish the dig won't be fast enough."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "In fact, simply delaying them might well contribute to that, because it gives the impression that we don't need much more time."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Distorting their spells would be a good start!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "What kind of a tactician is Gyozin?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "An experienced one. He doesn't go in for tricks or clever tactics, he's just... seen everything. He's a disciplinarian, likes spear and shield walls... actually, the troop movements we saw weren't really his style, so there probably is someone or someones competent handling logistics."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Kalza, maybe?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "What ho!" says a pleasing voice in Riverspeak. It comes from one of the two daylit knights, who flips the visor of his helmet up to reveal pale, chiseled features which tend to come to points - visible here are the nose and chin. "Have the monsters stalking these lands bothered you overmuch, fair lady?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's alone, which they might consider unusual. Or maybe not, she seems like she can handle herself. Tatsuya is undetectable inside her shadow, which might feel weird when they take to the air.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe, maybe not. You really only saw Kalza command like six of her own guys, and she mostly related to her miners as an overseer and taskmaster rathe than a military officer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Not overmuch." Ir grins. It's got an edge to it. "You boys from the castle, then."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah... anyway, there's not much more we can figure out by speculating. "So we should look for magic to pick apart, and magicians too, if it comes to that. What impression do you want to give them of us?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Faerie: "We are knights of the daylit court - defenders of these lands! What brings you so close to our doors?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "What do you mean?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Well... they're going to see us, yeah? Should we come out like holy avengers to inspire the people, should we come out like mad demons to get them to move faster... this'll be their first direct experience of us. First impressions count!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "I'm a skald. Fiddler and warrior strong.

Never met my match."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hope that's enough overweening pride for these guys.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You can never have too much overweening pride.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about overweening pride to dispute it.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The other knight, visor still down, actually crashes his lance against his shield a few times in appreciation. The first: "Well spoken! We in the Daylit Court have great appreciation for arts of all kinds. If you're as skilled as you say, you might even catch the eye of the princess...!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He continues: "It's dangerous here, despite our best efforts.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She laughs. "And when I wish to move on?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Avalleur looks briefly confused. "To where?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Maybe right back here."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's shadow rolls its eyes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Naturally, there is no change.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Always." She looks at Eikichi sideways for a moment, then smiles. "Follow my lead."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh hell yes.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Maybe I'd win a boon."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom bursts out of their hiding place and sprints toward the nearest mine.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Avalleur looks much more comfortable with Ir's current line of inquiry. "Excellent, excellent! I'm sure our beauteous freehold will serve as ample inspiration for your arts, my lady." He pulls at the reins of his riding bird, causing it to shrug a shoulder and swerve off into a formation of sorts with the other knight. The two wheelin wide circles around you, and then <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> around a notional cylinder of air leading away. Before your eyes, a path of mallow-soft cloudstuff is traced through the sky, spiraling upwards towards the Daylit Court.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir hops aboard Errant. Her grin hasn't faded. If anything, it's got even more of an edge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, to Eikichi before they attack and do their cool intro: "Ah! They have an Earth-Shaping Jewel! Anyone who's touched the jewel within the last day can work stone by hand as if it were clay, so long as the jewel itself isn't moved. Steal that, and the whole mine comes to a stop."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's very strange to ride Errant along the clouds - they're exactly as bouncy and elastic as they look, and there's a weird, resonating rubbery noise rather than the hooves-on-stone cadence Ir is used to. Still, it's plenty fast. In fact, it seems a bit faster than it should be, given the height of the clouds above the mountains, suggesting that someone's playing some kind of trick <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> with distances or velocities to speed the journey.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So it's in what only feels like a few minutes that Ir finds herself touching down in a broad, idyllic-looking town square. There's market stalls all around and broad streets stretching in every cardinal direction. Wooden signs depicting stylized swords, gems, or potions hang from poles or awnings. To the east is a great castle, pearly-white, with an adjoining church or temple of some <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> kind. Elsewhere are great fields where birds graze, some sort of barracks, a monastery or dojo, a sorcerers' tower...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's heading for the castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Avalleur advises Ir to investigate the inn, or simply join in the commotion of the market square, but seems to be a busy knight; he's almost immediately back off on patrol. Ir and her shadow are surrounded now by... townsfolk? Young or old, they're all clear-skinned and pointy-eared.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "No, I think not."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Here's the thing about skalds, sir knight."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya will have to get away quickly - he can't stay a shadow for much longer, and popping out of Ir's shadow would draw some unwanted eyes. Is there somewhere nearby he can stop being a shadow and start being a thief?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh, yeah, that's easy. At midday the town market is crowded indeed, and Tatsuya's got endless opportunities to simply slip off into the crowd or down some alley or another.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We're wise in the old ways of the world. And like you, we have our traditions we must abide. You think I didn't know when I walked up those dreamclouds, that once I did, I couldn't leave? I knew. I did it because I don't want to leave...until you all are forced to let me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Down in the mortal world, Blossom and Eikichi crest a cliff of jagged rock and sail straight through the air and line of sight of a small cabal of scandalized sorcerers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You go up to that castle, sir knight. You tell that pretty princess the world of man has a challenge for her subjects. And then you tell her to find the best musician amongst you, and meet me at the crossroads."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Unless you're yellow."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll slip away, then, and keep an eye on Ir from, well, a different set of shadows. All eyes ought to be on her, anyhow, so staying hidden shouldn't be that difficult.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...There better be some crossroads up here.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This looks less like a mine than a firing range. There's a staging area of sorts on a wide plateau around which are rough cabins, supply stockpiles, and paths and railways leading further down the mountain. The center of the plateau's a wide circle carved into the very stone and decorated with occult symbols and inlaid gemstones of arcane significance. Before the circle is a mine <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> entrance itself, but it's almost perfectly circular and much wider than could possibly have been practical to dig by hand. There are wooden logs and beams set into the stone presumably just in case, but the general impression is that someone's been blasting rather than digging their way down into the mountain.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's eyes and brow burn golden, and his hair flutters in the wind to match. In his left hand he holds a hellish and hateful thing, while his right hand gently holds his chin as he smirks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This impression is supported by the fact that four men and women in heavy leather robes are currently standing at significant points in the graven circle, shaping magic. Besides them, there's some of those hulking elementals, a contingent of guards in cathak colors, some miners whose chief pursuit seems to be hauling out the rubble that this sorcery leaves in its wake, and a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> dragon-blooded man with a sword and shield who's just stepped out of one of the cabins. You can tell because of the corona of flames around his head and shoulders.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cathak something-or-other, Blossom doesn't recognize him: "What-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir finds that there are definitely crossroads up here. Hell, the market square is essentially the biggest crossroads in the freehold. If she's heading up to the castle, no one stops her... until she reaches its actual doors, that is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll head to the crossroads first, but if no one shows up to meet her -- or if the knight just acts aggrieved and confused rather than relaying the message -- then she'll head up to the castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The walk feels shorter than it actually is, especially when Ir looks behind herself - separating the castle from the main market square is plenty of rolling emerald hillside and one long cobblestone bridge arcing from one cloud to another. The castle itself is tall, white, immaculately clean, and surrounded by a moat of sparkling blue water that nevertheless contains a few huge green <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> lizards that sort of lazily splash around. Right beside the castle, actually connected to it by a long, thin bridge of marble, is what must be the local church of Balor. It's an imposing structure of mostly upwards-pointing triangles whose stained glass windows are generally decked out in hues of red, orange, and purple and feature a lot of eye and sun iconography.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's hard to tell, incidentally, who up here is actually human. All the townsfolk seem to have things to do, even if those things are milling around and waiting to be spoken to.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But like I was saying Ir, Ir isn't stopped until she reaches the castle doors. There, a pair of skinny, mustachioed guards with pointy helmets that dramatically cross their halberds before her just as she approaches the castle's main entrance.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's task-oriented. Indulging this fantasy world will only strengthen it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The guards are silent, and almost mechanical - when Ir steps back, their halberds uncross, but when she steps forward they cross again, and the farther forward she moves the more it feels like she's walking through molasses or pressing up against a physical wall. The implication is that she has to earn access to the castle by some means.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh for the love of.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are there any other ways in?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Probably...? It might involve scaling the wall or swimming the moat or finding and sneaking in through some kind of servant's entrance. Tatsuya would have to do some scouting.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Eikichi and Blossom are almost certainly joining battle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, Ir seems safe for now. There's probably time to do a little scouting, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> These 'guards' probably aren't even people, properly speaking. She'll wander back to the town square and poke her head in the inn. Is anyone else around here playing music?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi and his pain in the ass plans.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya will try seeking out a servant's entrance first - scaling the wall is appealing, but perhaps too flashy, and swimming is awful in the best of circumstances. He'll keep an ear out to hear if things go poorly with Ir, but come on, breaking into a castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi and Blossom have crested a ridge such that they're right above a contingent of soldiers guarding the sorcerers at work. The sorcerers themselves appear to be mortals initiatied into the arts, and they're totally consumed with their magic - together, they're constantly gesturing and chanting to keep control and direction of a great auger of nearly-invisible earth essence that's <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> lancing forward into the mine entrance and, presumably, extending downward into the mountains. Eikichi suspects that some complicated infrastructure involving mirrors and geomantic carvings is allowing the spell to thread its way far deeper than its casters could normally reach or see on their own.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Right now, both Solars are hovering within a whirlwind, out of reach of the soldiers and elementals both. That's probably why the Cathak guardsmen are drawing bows.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir find a lot to potentially do at the town square. There's actually a little performer's stage, currently occupied by a band playing a catchy but repetitive tune that seems to be setting the tempo of all the other activities going on in the market square. There's a bar with room for a performer, plenty of spots she could just set up along the road to start busking... 'skald' is a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> biiit foreign to the daylit court, but 'bard' is definitely not.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Tatsuya's at liberty to try to find a way into the castle that doesn't involve playing along - or, at least, involves playing along with a different set of players. Step one, case the place.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll go busking, then. She's got a mistrust of these institutions. Doesn't want to be pressured into signing any contracts.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi holds his arms akimbo as if to sweep all the sorcerers into a big hug. "Do not despair, my friends! We come to dismantle the old order, not its prisoners. Imagine a world where we can practice our art without ostracism, a world where we needn't peddle our knowledge to soldiers and armies to prosper! In a more righteous world there is so much we can achieve together."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The thief finds a number of avenues. First, there is some kind of submerged tunnel at the bottom of the moat, but using it would probably be uncomfortable for a number of reasons - holding your breath, cold water, all the giant alligators... beyond that, there's also a hedge maze of sorts on the opposite end of the castle from the main doors, so if you can get across the moat by <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> some means and navigate a complicated but ultimately solveable pattern of guard patrols you'll be able to just slip inside a back entrance.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir runs through the classics on Iscariot as a six-string: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95WeNwF5448 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VydnNO2A0k4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_NHr4lvqc and so on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "This is the promise of the Unconquered Sun. It is the promise we stand and deliver. It is the promise of a better day."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Come! What say you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Finally, there's the church. It looks open to the public, and it's connected to the castle by a bridge, so if you can go in there and then lose whoever keeps an eye on visitors to stop them from just wandering off into the side halls you could probably climb to the main tower/steeple thing and then take the bridge across.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi speaks, and the four sorcerers share glances over the roiling tangle of earth essence they're carefully manipulating. To the layman, it doesn't appear they do anything further.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The two solars know different, though, because they've got arcane training. They can see that two of the mages, both women, subtly unhook their hand gestures from the magic that's going on, ceasing their upkeep of the spell. A third, a man, is sweating - he keeps glancing up at the Stormwind Rider, clearly tempted, but ultimately grits his teeth and holds on. The fourth, another <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> woman, twists her face into a mask of fury and doesn't let up for a moment.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To the last, Eikichi says softly, "So be it." and begins to crush her will.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well. If they're going to make it that simple, they deserve this.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's skill is recognized almost immediately. It's not half an hour before a small crowd of elfin villagers and townsfolk is surrounding her play area and tapping their feet, dancing with each other, singing along, cheering her on... it's hard to tell which of these are basically constructs or hobgoblins and which are abducted people, but at least one listener must be a full-blown <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> raksha; she's a short-haired woman in a long furred coat who's demanded that her servants stop her carriage by the side of the road so that she can get a better listen.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya runs across the water and into the hedge maze. Crap moat you've got there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir ignores the rakhsa and goes about her set. She ignores the townsfolk too, for the most part; she's absorbed in her art.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And she's letting the marks come to her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's when Ir is between sets that a long-faced majordomo whose pointed ears and nose droop dramatically and eyes always seem to be closed approaches her. His lady has a proposition, he says; she'll be attending the court this very night, and her retinue is in need of a good musician if she's to impress.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And, once he's snuck through the hedge maze, it's a crap maze they have there too. He slips inside the castle without looking back.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir accepts, but is careful to decline any compensation or offer of further employment.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A hail of poorly-aimed boulders goes sailing past Eikichi and Blossom, missing by a damn mile. Following those boulders is what might be a full-on meteor, though; the sword-wielding Cathak dynast is blazing with flame as he takes a prodigious leap up the side of the very cliff that Eikichi and Blossom came drifting down from!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A red jade daiklave, limned in flames, come swinging through the walls of the Stormwind Rider.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That was actually pretty had, Tatsuya finds, but not for the reasons infiltrations usually are. It's not that the guards were particualrly clever or observant, or the sight lines really punishing - there was just so much ground to cover, so many strictly consistent patterns of patrol to memorize and thread between. Still, he's done it - he's inside the castle itself, free to poke <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> around. What's Tatsuya want to do - rob the treasury, assassinate the king, graze off the kitchens...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Pretty hard*<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's good practice on Ir's part, but largely unnecessary; any oaths sworn or agreements shaken on are really only going to be binding for the fae, especially given that the Dawn caste is proof against the Wyld's insidious influence.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Either way, though, her entrance to the castle is secured - although she'll probably have to wait for the evening to make it. The raksha noble Ir'll be playing for is named Rajiezna, and seems to be some kind of business mogul - she's got her hand in a wide variety of the item and potion and weapon and so on shops arrayed around the central square. Actually, she'd be delighted if Ir <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> could play around there for a while, or at least teach the noble's own bards a few good tunes, but it won't be a dealbreaker if Ir refuses.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That aside, Ir's got some time to pass, which she could conceivably use on shopping or fine dining or just exploration of the rest of the freehold.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will indulge the raksha that much, as it'll get her more face time with the people she's supposed to be saving. But she's otherwise focused on getting into that castle and making a wager.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, Tatsuya meant to open a door for Ir, but she seems to have that covered. He'll have to content himself with looting, or sabotage - are there any instruments laying about?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hmm, clever. Tatsuya roves the halls, searching for entertainers and their panoplies...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom raises her arms to the heavens. "Grinding forward bit by bit! Each turn re-creates the cycle of Essence! Heavenly purity coming to a single point... that's how a drill works!" By the gods, she's right! So right that the spell under the command of the other sorcerers bucks and twists out of their control, rampaging according to Blossom's will and severing key support beams <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in the delving far below!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *_*<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As she spends the day in fairyland, Ir becomes more and more conversant with the differences between the actual people and the nameless passers-by that seem to have been magicked into the streets and buildings for the sake of flavour and verisimilitude. There are tells - the people sweat and tire, the people use the washroom, the people sometimes look off into the distance or down <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> over the edge of the clouds wistfully. They don't SEEM particularly terrified or unhappy, for the most part, though a few are a bit crazy, or kind of fading mentally into the robotic simplicity of the conjured townsfolk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The good news is that there aren't that many abducted humans here - as large as the kingdom is, there are maybe twenty or thirty, all told, although there are probably more in the barracks, in the castle, and other parts of the daylit court Ir hasn't explored thoroughly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Of these, perhaps the most arresting is a green-clad youth who comes striding into the shop of Rajiezna's armorer at the same time as Ir is giving the musician there (also a mortal) pointers as to how better to end the smithy's theme so that it loops nicely. His shield's broken from another trip down to the mortal world, apparently, and he needs it repaired before he can sally forth <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> again.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Huh. Takes all kinds.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Down in the aforementioned mortal world, Blossom and Eikichi together seize the Pulverizing Auger and drag it wildly through the very mines it's built! The sorcerers gasp, and the young Cathak warrior roars with rage, as the very mountain you're standing on rumbles and buckles and even the mine's very entrance shears in half and collapse in on itself.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There uh... wasn't anyone inside, right? On account of the auger doing all the work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not right then. It happens in shifts - the spell bores and bores and bores, and then teams of laborers go in to dig out the rubble and put in more support beams.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya hunts around. He creeps past patrolling guards, servants carrying big plates of food, doddering old priests whose robes drag on the hallways behind them. Eventually, though, he picks up on the sound of music, and that he's able to follow through the castle until he finds a broad atrium at the castle's west side. There, an entire orchestra plays, composed roughly half-and-half <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> of pointy eared humans (or humanoids, at least) and what seem to be motile plants of all shapes and sizes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's no conductor that Tatsuya can immediately see, until he realizes that the curtains of leafy ivy hanging down across the pillars on the far, open-to-the-air side of the chamber are actually tresses of hair. There's a gigantic - like, ten or twelve feet tall - woman with green skin and foliage crawling 'cross her body who's sort of reclining along a high platform across the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> room and sleepily watching the orchestra perform.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya can see a few fiddlers, including one which seems to be the star of the orchestra. It's, like... a sort of onion-shaped bulb with a leaf instead of a face, maybe half the size of a human or less? Really killing it, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well. We'll just have to do something about that, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Ir's gotten the new customer's - really, the long-time repeat customer's - attention. The young man wanders over to her and the usual musician, shooting an inquisitive look and a questioning noise. "Ah, hey, lad. Just getting a few pointers." Does Ir want to explain herself?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If it's Tatsuya's plan to sabotage the instruments or musicians themselves, one supposes he'll have to listen and wait.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Eikichi can't get loose - the dynast confronting him is leaving burning footprints in the air itself, dancing back and forth on the whirling grit and sand kicked up by and surrounding the Stormwind Rider spell. The elementals and guardsmen are taking aim once again, and the alarm's being raised, and the sorcerers are newly at odds with each other...<br>

Of the three remaining, two sit in a church basement, one watching the other lay on a bunk and stare at the ceiling while he enjoys being under house arrest. The other is free to do whatever he likes, in a city famous for its thousand ways of entertaining the rich and leisured. The only problem is that he’s stopped liking all of them. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The two busybodies, though, wake up with things to do. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clinton Cavanaugh is going to court. And that probably means going to Court.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> First, though, he'll shower, dress, feed the girls, feed himself from the supply in the blood fridge, and call the office to make sure there's nothing new that demands his attention. There probably isn't -- unless he has any text messages from Bryan or Brian -- but it's a good ritual and lets Buchanan and Rush know he's awake and ready for work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson Frost is going to look at some flowers. He should bring Blythe a gift. What does she like?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You could call amateur espionage and active engagement with policy institutions being a 'busybody', if you like.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hey, those are nice shoes. Custom-fitted?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There isn’t - although the fact that he only has to call Buchanan and Rush should give him pause, considering how much Donald Bren has been on his mind lately. Bren has more muscle and brains to call on than two office-dwelling ghouls. Santiago has been helpfully running errands for the barony since Cav got awarded it, but…maybe it’s time for him to start finding loyal retainers of his own. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blythe likes all sorts of things: offbeat foreign literature, High Art, medieval weaponry that’s very strictly not just for display, gardening equipment…<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are only a couple different ways to get retainers, most of them very morally compromised and the most straight-forward among them requiring some form of Court permission.<br>

And she's not in any real danger, anyway- Helena may be on the edge of cutting her loose but it turns out the Court supplies these rations to Barons and flunkies, like a kind of evil version of the Red Cross.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson goes to the gallery alone. He keeps it locked, partly so the expensive climate control system isn't working overtime. It's cool and dry, with tiled floors. Soft lighting comes to life automatically when he crosses the threshold. Easy to imagine a hushed tour guide. But nothing's under glass, not the books or the statues or the weapons. The weapons, in particular, are on sturdy <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances is dressed in a sensible black, er, dress. “Oh, uh,” she says, looking around. “I’m sure people will start to show up soon.” She brightens. “But you’re here!

The cold white light of fluorescents illuminate the front entrance, with its pillars and hedges. Three servants will be waiting by the door, one to attend to his Hollywood counterparts, one to take anything heavy off of Wilson’s hands, and the other to greet him effusively. “Baron Hollywood.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson walks like he's encumbered, but then doesn't he always? The servant can take his coat and then Wilson goes inside.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances looks around the interior of the beautifully renovated nightclub for an answer. “Um…there’s a few people in the corner…that’s pretty much it. You’re welcome to them…” There are, it seems, about half a dozen people nervously trying to make conversation with each other, a bartender with nothing to do, and two figures talking to each other in a back circular booth. The nightclub really is beautiful, though! Soft golden <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blythe Sulzberger, Countess Lancaster, descends down the grand staircase to meet him. She’s wearing the same outfit she wore to the opera, minus the hat. “Wilson. I hope your trip here was uneventful.” All around, landscape paintings showing the poppy fields in full summer bloom light up the room with oranges and reds. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances looks certain. “Yes, of course! I put advertisements in all the major newspapers. Even the Pennysaver.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He takes a short break, during which he wonders if he shouldn't set up a ceiling-mounted webcam pointing down at the table, so he can have recordings of the entire process.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They seem to be…a collection of different things, actually. Short quotations from larger works, interspersed with diary-like entries, starting from 1972 and heading back in time. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not only would that help with the whole memory thing, but his new 'colleagues' might find it interesting as well. Or maybe not. Who knows.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So things like “You can tell the state of dispassion has been reached when the spiritual intellect starts to catch glimpses of its own inner radiance, when it can remain in a state of tranquility even when troubled by dream images, and when it can look on all of life’s affairs with equanimity,” are mixed in with mundane reports of politicking in the Orange Court, describing the petty feuds of different nobles Cav has either never heard o<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> or whose names are disguised with simple assigned letters. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's wearing a light suit of pale brown linen, the sort of thing you might wear if you were going to look at a garden outdoors in summer. "Blythe! You look lovely. I brought you something." He presents the halberd to her with a flourish as from midair.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He puts his palms up at Sponger. "I mean, like. You beat the shit outta Cosmo Morgan, one of the worst ratfuckers out there. So you're at least doing something right."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He wonders briefly if this stuff might be dangerous to even read. Cav remembers that Rollie's condition spread memetically. At least after a fashion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances looks less certain as she does her best to dance. It looks like she hasn’t learned any moves since the midcentury. “Well…we’re technically in Donald Bren’s territory. I just bought the feeding rights to the club itself. So you probably…shouldn’t.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lancaster examines it with interest. “Oh, this really is genuine.” She looks at the armorer’s stamp. “You shouldn’t have. I only wanted to catch up with you.” She looks around. “I’ll have one of the paintings wrapped for you. Take it home with you.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sponger shakes his head. “I don’t think awaiting a death sentence in a basement is because I did something right. By anyone’s law.” <br>

Just a few people here makes it dangerous.. but that's fine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One of the figures in the back booth has tilted the massive oak table up so it’s sloping. “See, no gum.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lancaster: “Busy.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances ignores it. “So, um…are you impressed?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "What kind of work they got you doing?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lancaster: “Keeping tabs on bits and bobs and figures of interest. Like you. I’m acquiring quite the stable of interesting associates.” <br>

What’s the line? If I told you, I’d have to kill you,” she jokes. Wilson thinks. She’s not very good at it. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Not necessarily a dealbreaker."<br>

Cav can get as far as a fifth into the diary before his cipher abruptly stops working, around 1971. Actually, this diary seems to jump around in time quite a bit. Maybe its sorted by theme rather than date? The last entry reads: <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, KJ is impressed, just not.. pleased. She can channel that. "It's way beyond what I'd expected. The ambition and effort it takes to move into this business is a big deal!

Franks knew Alicia, and Alicia had business in Los Angeles that she's yet to divulge to Cav. But attacking that obstacle head-on was likely to get him nowhere except compromised.<br>

Been fightin' to defend us against the darkness for, oh, years." The green-clad youth, a sun-and-eye crest on his mirrored shield, has already wandered out to the main market.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Especially if he's working with (for?) the Fair Folk, and he can play an instrument.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's found an open plaza that hosts what must be the daylit court's orchestra. It's a motley of elfin humans (or humanoids) and plant-creatures all playing together on a collection of mostly woodwinds and stringed instruments, all watched over by a massive woman of sylvan aspect. She's dozing or daydreaming or something, only barely paying attention as they practice, but her <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> long, leafy hair cascades down and across the floor the musicians play on and there's a strong sense they're dependent on her somehow.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, down in the world of mortals, all hell has broken loose as Blossom and Eikichi have seized control of mining sorcery, used it to collapse an entire series of tunnels, and then found their attempt to simply freakin' bolt arrested by a young Cathak swordsman. He's snarling at them from beneath his helm, leaving burning footprints in the air as he stands on the dust and grit <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> kicked up by the floating Stormwind Rider.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What the heck!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "UGH. Can you knock him off or something?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir resolves to try and stay out his way, more than anything else. But that won't be possible if he's got powerful friends in the castle, and there's no waya kid like that doesn't have powerful friends in the castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sorcerers are sort of eyeing each other and trying to figure out if they should be pulling daggers. The various landbound foes of Eikichi and Blossom aren't so conflicted, though - a hail of rocks and arrows come flying up at them!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> From within the shower of missiles comes one arrow that flies straight and true, as if Heaven itself smiles on the bowman. The Essence of air courteously withdraws, so as to offer no resistance- swifter than eagles it races toward the mark. Blossom doesn't notice any of this, and ducks her head to the side. The arrow hisses past her and shatters on a nearby rock.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hmm. Tatsuya's not exactly in a position to strike openly, here, so he'll have to settle for gathering information. Is there any fiddler among the group that's distinguishing themselves right now?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Has it got to be a fiddler? The star of the show's got what'd be a fiddler in a human's hands, but he's playing it as though it were a cello.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, Blossom's assailant is what's probably a man clad in the same black and red Cathak armor that the rest of this unit of guardsmen is wearing. He's got a very nice bow, though, a curve of glittering steel strung with what might be silk. None of his fellows care, as far as you can tell.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The more he watches, the more Tatsuya gets the idea that very few of the musicians here are, like... real? Or, at least, possessed of independent vitality. The great majority of them, particularly those with leafy features or who are literally just stubby-limbed, leaf-masked plants, look to be nothing more than extensions of the dozing sylvan giant - who's got to be some kind of <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> visitor or immigrant to this particular freehold, since her aesthetic's so far off from that of most of the denizens Tatsuya's seen around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One of the musicians, that woman with the flute, is a (mutated and ensorcelled) human, but she's nothing special as flautists go. The little cello-playing turnip, too, seems self-willed somehow - but, in particular, is still an offshoot or even belonging of the greater fairy. Like, he sort of fades a bit when she's not paying  attention to him directly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sabotaging the orchestra probably means sabotaging the raksha that owns it, somehow, OR symbolically stealing the performers or their instruments from the raksha.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, he doesn't currently have a way to make fire on hand, so the easiest way of sabotage is out. Stealing performers and/or instruments, however... that can be done.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's still biding her time. Probably not worth it making many waves until the social event she's been sponsored for.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Much more dangerous than the poorly-aimed boulders is a reverse rainstorm of deadly arrows! Neither Solar is actually scathed, but Blossom's all but fallen out of the Stormwind Rider in the course of evading the countless arrowheads. It's awful when enemy forces are both well-trained and lucky.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One arrow can be dodged, but dozens? Blossom's hands fly to slap the missiles out of the air before they can hit her, but they're faster than she can move and she's losing ground quickly!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> C'monnnnnnn<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Get LOST!" Blossom cups her hands and grows a rapidly spinning sphere of fire between them, throwing it at the enraged Dynast. The flames themselves might not bother a child of that element, but the force of the impact still sends him reeling!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dynast: "Gyaaah! You think your- you think that's- rrggh-...!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, it seems to me that Tatsuya's at liberty to attempt to sneak in and work some kind of sabotage right now, or brazenly confront the wood-raksha for whatever reason, or lay low and wait for a better or more obvious opportunity. Meanwhile, Ir's got little to do but see to the occasional favors her patron might ask of her until such time as the sun sets and she's taken to play <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> at the castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya will hold out for a better chance -- wading into a crowd is just asking for trouble, and the wood-raksha, while a tempting target, is foolish to go after right now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As Blossom aims a firebolt at her almost-hidden assailant, she might be given to notice a flickering of crimson starlight just under the brow of his helmet...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Heeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaarrrrghhh!" Her fireball burns toward the archer, but his answering arrow... splits it! Stunned, Blossom barely has time to avoid the arrow as it zips past her ear.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom meets the eye of the man who launched the counterstroke, but he looks - uncertain, almost panicked.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nope nope nope. Last time Eikichi flew into battle with Blossom in the Rider he had to wash her blood out of his hair. Looks like Team Solar's blasting off again...!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now that Eikichi's wise to the way this dynast moves, he can counter it - sort of suck in the bottom of the stormwind rider to deny the man any rungs or shelfs of whirling air, spin and bulge the center to dislodge him and push him backwards. In a blur of motion, the two Solars have hitched themselves back over the cliff face they dropped down from, and while a torrent of rocks and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> arrowheads comes drumming against the stone or flying over their heads, it's not enough to so much as slow them down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Should we stop and rest or go now?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Ir's at liberty to follow the Hero's journeys at a distance if she wants. He visits the blacksmith... the tavern... the potion shop... the barracks... looks like a fairly practiced routine of equipment upkeep and news investigation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's just about ready to creep out of line of sight entirely when he notices the golden gleam of a half-lidded eye is aimed right at him. In a langorous voice, the green-skinned raksha murmurs: "You like what you hear?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir might as well keep tabs on him, but she's not going to creep around the damn village after him or anything.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'm all right if you are." She slaps his shoulder, grinning. "Oh my GODS did you SEE that archer?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Shit. Let his guard down. He turns towards the raksha as casual as someone who just got caught sneaking around can possibly be. "It's... pretty good."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Arrow right through a fireball! I'm sure he's terrified now, but he'll drink for weeks off that!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "That was a really lucky shot."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He probably won't drink for weeks off that, though. He'll probably die like the rest of them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The raksha: "Oh, I should hope. I try... I take great pains. Perhaps they'd not have invited me, otherwise..." The shrugs a shoulder and shifts position on the colonnade she's lounging on. "...but what brought you here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Will he, though, Eikichi's and Blossom are given to wonder. He was really good. Really good - and though he was sure to wear a snug, scalp-shielding helmet, both Solars are pretty sure they saw at least a hint of crimson when that final arrow was loosed.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Crimson? What does that mean?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Plus, that bow looked a bit too fancy. ...still, it's a hard thought to hold onto, and while either of our heroes can if they really try, they'll have a devil of a time getting anyone else to remember.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom has basically forgotten already.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Oh gods."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mars... the maiden of battles.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya and Blossom are, at the moment, whirling across the landscape. They're moving much faster than anyone at the last mine can follow... well, anyone but the sorcerers, but as half of them just betrayed the other half there's some logistical confusion there that's preventing rapid chase even if someone does know how to conjure the Rider.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya and Blossom, huh.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She laughs to herself, pleased as punch as far as Tatsuya can tell. "Yes! Yes, how I love him. I should name him soon."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A sidelong glance. "...but she's slipping a little. For all this freehold's riches, they're short on real performers."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Hm." What's her angle...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi can tell, looking at the carts of excavated rubble, that this is definitely where the earth-shaping gemstone is at work; rather than craggy and rough-edged as they would be if worked loose by picks and hammers, the the chunks of liberated earth here are rounded, visibly kneaded into shape by palm and fingerprints. The grade of the material, though, suggests it's been dug up <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> from quite deep indeed... meaning the hearthstone itself isn't up here in the camp.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The digging operation must have proceeded far enough apace that they've moved the hearthstone itself down into the tunnels so as to extend the radius of hand-workable stone as deep as can be.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tunnel big enough to fly into?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Up here, you'll find those laborers currently off their shifts, and, unfortunately, a small army of highly-alarmed guards.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It is, but you don't know how long it stays wide enough. At the moment, Cathak soldiers are rushing to raise the alarm and block off the entrance.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "...so he plays like that and doesn't even have a name? What's his. I dunno. How's he do that?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's interlocutor peers at him further. "Oh, you know. I dreamed up a good musician... and another... and another. Most of them I threw away. Some I spun from raw gossamer, other from the elements, other from some dreams I found or traded for..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Raksha: "I forgot what I put into this little one, honestly. But he hasn't bored me yet. You don't know any good names, do you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "I'm terrible with them, honestly."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Raksha: "Mmm, then I'll keep looking. I just hope he doesn't disappoint... though perhaps it wouldn't be too bad if he did."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soon Ir will have teased out three specific variants of Iscariot, the stringed instrument -- the six-string, a larger four stringed variant she drops down like a cello, and a fiddle she can pop up onto her shoulder. The hard part -- the really hard part -- is teasing out a bow. The moonsilver doesn't want to separate, and definitely doesn't want to provide the friction against itself <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> necessary for sound. Soon she figures out the trick: some hair from Errant's mane and some careful practice, and the bow will leap out of the instrument's body, thread the bowstring, and remain connected by the thinnest tendril while playing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Raksha: "This is a nice place, but... staying...? Mmmm..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "We can just fly right over them before they put arrow to string..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She probably can't get a full string standup bass out of this thing, sadly -- not with the right sound, anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But wind instruments might be a fun challenge down the line.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's not wrong. It's a harrowing dive straight down over the lip of a cliff face and then into a wide mine tunnel atop a magical whirlwind, but, apparently, a possible one - the motion's so fast and sudden that the Cathak guards have only started firing arrows by the time Eikichi and Blossom are already deep into the tunnel.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It starts branching, though...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Might be worth sticking around. You never know who might show up here to keep things interesting."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Raksha: "Mmm. Well... the same to you, human. I hope I'll see you tonight. ...stick around for the rehearsal, if you like." She turns again, shifting idly until she's lying on her back with one great arm hanging down so her fingers brush the auditorium floor. Beneath and beside her, her orchestra plays on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, that went poorly. It could've gone worse, but he still hasn't actually managed to help Ir at all.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We've all been there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, if nothing else it's intel. The weak spot in the orchestra is the mortal - of which there's only one, which is a good thing if you're worried about being able to collect people quickly and completely - and the star performer's a semi-autonomous belonging of a raksha master. Conceivably you could do something with any or all of that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Of course, Tatsuya still has the opportunity for some kind of insane hit and run here.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It'd be a shame, of course... why not just kick back and listen?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's probably got it all under control. What's the harm in just listening to some tunes?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom and Eikichi race along the mine tunnels, following the handprints dug into the walls and the sparkling, pearly gradient of the distant hearthstone's power that only Eikichi can actually see. For a while they're able to whirl down broad, well-lit, and widely-excavated tunnels, but it's not long before Eikichi's forced to throttle the Stormwind Rider's speed and then either <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> fold it into its personal transport mode or banish it all together.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let's just walk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then it's just running - maybe walking, as Eikichi's going to get winded - towards the prize. The deeper you go, the more actual miners you see, but it seems like some kind of alarm's been raised already - they mostly scream and dive for side tunnels as they see you approaching. You can hear the shouting and marching of the guardsmen somewhere behind you, but you've got a substantial <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> head start.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Whew! This is a lot easier than the other one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You turn a corner, and there you are - a wide, partially-excavated hall. On a pedestal rests what must be the Earth-Shaping Jewel, an egg of gleaming amber ensconced within a half-complete shell of craggy granite. Right before it, crouched in some sort of meditation, is Cathak Kalza - she's fully armored, holding her reaper daiklave before her, a few inches of the gleaming silver-blue <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> blade visible between the hilt and the scabbard. The terrestrial exalt has her head bowed and is murmuring to herself, and Eikichi can see some kind of magic being drawn forth out of the blade, swirling around Kalza's head and pouring into her anima.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Uh-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is she praying to it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Beside Kalza is a huge man with a hammer that glows with furnace heat. Flanking both terrestrials is a contingent of Cathak soldiers; cowering away from it all are a number of workers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Elsewhere, Tatsuya and Ir, in their own ways, wile away the day. If Tatsuya wants to just chill and enjoy some tunes, he's unbothered; any castle guards that come marching down the hall are simply shooed away by the gigantic Miaja before they can notice and object to the mortal interloper. Ir, meanwhile, is largely unmolested by the other denizens of the freehold; as she's in Rajiezna's <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> care, she won't be challenged by the guard or dragooned into the military or similar.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's talking to the sword. And the sword's talking back.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Whoa.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Day turns to dusk turns to night, and soon Ir's summoned - the political affairs of the Daylit Court have been concluded, and so it's time for the much more important matters of mingling, gossip, and revelry. Does Ir suffer to be dressed up?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Similarly, does Tatsuya want to join the orchestra? He can get set up with a whistle, or maybe some drums...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll leave that to the professionals. Besides, he's here to support Ir. He'll have to find a place where he can do so, in case things go south.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The moment Eikichi and Blossom step into the room, Kalza snaps her head up to glare at them, Kalza's ally snorts and seizes the hearthstone in one gauntleted hand, and Kalza's troops raise their weapons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hrmph.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sure, why not. But she'll keep her armor close.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The lady Rajiezna likes reds, yellows, floppy hats, and enormous feathers. Ir makes it look good, though. (That's in comparison to Rajiezna and closer members of her retinue, who make it look sublime if you ignore the too-perfect symmetries and other uncanny elements of faerie appearance). So it is that the Solar skald finds herself marching into a great ballroom sort of chamber a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> few hours past sunset.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir has, at this point, a good headcount of mortals present in the Freehold. She counts four of them here - one in the orchestra, three others acting as servants or squires for the attending raksha. She knows there are maybe twenty in total back in the rest of the Freehold, either sleeping in beds, sweeping streets, or tending to the graveyard outside the church.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's an orchestra playing at the side of the room, of course, framed against a great opening in the castle wall such that just a few pillars, veils, and curtains of vines separate them from the night sky. If Tatsuya isn't formally among them, he's teeeechnically not allowed to be here... and is therefore, presumably, hiding or in disguise.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When she walks in, she'll be wearing Iscariot as a serpentine armband bracelet that twists up around each arm decoratively, across her shoulders, and down the other arm. She's not showing an immodest amount of skin, but she's showing enough that the whole of the weapon is visible.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She realized while dressing she's looking less muscular and more simply athletic these days, though her battle prowess hasn't suffered for it. Consequence of a having a residency rather than tromping around the wastes climbing every damn thing for months. Irritating in some respects, but she does make the dress look good.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's there, but out of view. Little trickier to make work than a disguise, but less risk of getting called out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Besides the broad assortment of achingly beautiful pointy-eared nobles, who broadly exist along a spectrum from 'foppish aristocrat' to 'rugged knight', there are a few other personalities of note. There's a bearded, golden-eyed old man in long white robes... Xalvierre, the mountain-dwelling master. There's an armed and armored woman easily seven feet tall with a great mane of <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> blood-red hair... the captain of the guard, Corazelle. Then there's the royals.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The king of the daylit court, a short, portly, white-haired elf who everyone only refers to by his title. The beloved princess Naeva, a slim and solemn figure whose features are mostly hidden by white veils. The high priest of the Church of Balor, a hunched and fussy-looking faerie called Narvithex whose eyes and mouth are hidden by bushy brows and a bushy mustache, respectively. Ir <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> knows all these names because the lords and ladies around her whisper them to each other.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Here's the scheduling: there'll be some mingling, then some performances - music included - then more mingling, then around midnight the night will be largely over. Ir gets the sense that there'll be a bit of an unspoken competition in the middle there, but mostly what's at stake is the relative status of the raksha present. If she wants to throw down some kind of gauntlet or otherwise <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> toss a wrench into the workings of the court, she'll have to pick her moment and then, well, do it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Underground, Eikichi and Blossom can tell that they're in easily the most viable of Cathak's digs. The very wall behind Kalza is mostly intact stone, but visible through a few cracks and finer-swipes is a glittering basalt reminiscent of the Sword pylon the Circle first convened at far to the north.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Given your location relative to the middle of the range, that's probably some kind of peripheral stabilizing infrastructure rather than an entrance to the pylon proper, but still.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Kalza: "You've trapped yourselves."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Yep."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Scared?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will mingle, then, and wait.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And see if she can't figure out where the hell Tatsuya is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is he here in disguise, or...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya is currently hiding out in the rafters, prowling around and waiting for a moment to strike. If necessary. Which makes it rather difficult to give Ir a sign that he hasn't just fucked off and shirked his duties, but, well, he already did that once.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a click as Cathak Kalza fully sheaths her reaper daiklave. "No."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This is almost like being in a room full of Eikichis, except they're more open about the fact that they fuck and have trouble understanding lesser creatures.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The tiny woman in her late twenties stops in front of the Baron. “Excuse me, where’s your restroom?” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Thank you.” She does, but the fact that she’s Blushing makes this request a little less strange. The door closes behind her. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As Lancaster types on her phone, Wilson can read her pretty easily - she’s not making any effort to hide her mood in his presence, after all. She’s irritated at the sudden nature of the events, excited at the prospect of violence against Bren, and frustrated that 1) she probably shouldn’t intervene personally 2) letting this play out naturally probably isn’t the most responsible thing to do. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson checks his phone. Has he just got the message from Cavanaugh?<br>

It’s in a deserted business park, quite emptied of civilian cars.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hall’s hand jerks out of Tommy’s, like she’s been bitten. “Oh.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy follows them in, silent but with a sanguine impression.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson’s ride moves swiftly over the dark hills separating Lancaster from the rest of the County.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Pearl: “Aren’t your friends down there?” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Nevermind. There's one guy I know, Cavanaugh. I warned him to get out."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Two of the three in the conference room as Hall, Cav, and Tommy take their seats turn to look. Seated at the figure at the end of the table’s right is a young man with shoulder-length blonde hair, a nervous smile playing around on his features. At the figure’s left is a older man, fine scarring running across his nose and brow. His facial hair is combed into a neatly cropped beard and spike moustache. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's still got the blush of life about her, so the oddly perceptive Pearl Bernstein might detect a soul in conflict. Something like terror, actually, as if she's already gone out on a limb.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Which is true, because if Bren wins tonight and Murray thinks that report was too-long delayed...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dwarfing both, the Count of Long Beach stands at the far end of the table, unmoving, limbs hidden in his robe, features hidden behind a white porcelain mask. The mask, Cav notes, is smiling. The last time he saw Bren, in the whorl of combat at Bressi Ranch, it was frowning. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I am well, Baron. There is much we have to discuss.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Pearl: “So what now?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jessie bangs the table with her hand. “Are you just gonna leave him out to dry??” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Yeah. Yeah, we do."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Before we begin, as a courtesy, I'll note that Baron Wilson Frost of Hollywood will be joining us as well."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He takes a deep sip of his coffee. "Mmm. Good stuff."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To the rest of the table: "There is coffee in the kitchenette. If you're Blushing."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Before Cav clarifies, the three people with Bren look around the room as if expecting him to fall out of the ceiling. At the mention of coffee, Hall gets up to get a cup. “Not like I was planning on sleeping…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Deacon folds his hands on the table, shrugs. "A lot has been happening."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Are you- do you know what it would mean, to get in a fight with Bren? Or even to be the one stopping a fight he wants to have/"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bren’s total lack of movement makes him hard to read. As does his lack of a face. “Hollywood to Laguna is quite the trip. You must be good friends. It was my understanding that Frost’s severe depression and guilt over his sire’s disgrace meant he kept to himself.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "I'm sure it was."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jessie realizes KJ’s position. “Oh, wait you work for Murray.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav gets a text. <5 minutes.><br>

There’s a long column of ten or so black SUVs weaving effortlessly in and out of the traffic of other cars as they pass, so well-coordinated it almost appears to be one large vehicle.

KJ and Co. arrive in the office parking lot. They can see 10 SUVs parked in a circle, a pair of masked and outfitted guards watching over them.

Cav must recognize Sherman Ma from the ballet and other functions, although he seemd to be almost emotionless compared to the extremely angry person Cav meets coming up the stairs. Also, he wasn’t wearing full plate, embedded with rubies and fine red scrollwork, or carrying a greatsword. His dark skin is flushed red for good measure. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's night time in the Daylit Court. The place does live up to its name, though; as late as it gets, the sky never quite loses the rosy blush of distant sunset. Somehow, this doesn't stop the stars from shining clearly down from the sky directly above the castle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the Unconquered Sun appearing to linger in these lands is a fully cosmetic effect, Ir doesn't take much solace in it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir and Tatsuya are both part of the ongoing festivities, and both blending in in their own ways. Dressed up outlandishly, Ir's part of the retinue of one Lady Rajienza, marched into the grand hall alongside acrobats, jugglers, trained bears, and the like. Meanwhile, Tatsuya's completely out of sight, at times shuffling unseen between courtiers and at other times clinging to the sides <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> of pillars or sidling behind pieces of furniture.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Here's what Ir and Tatsuya pick up, from the chatter: the foul depredations of the Nightwreathed Court continue apace, corrupting the mountains and abducting or consuming their innocent denizens. It's only possible or practical for the daylit knights to defend or rescue so many people at once, so everyone's got their hopes pinned on the efforts of the Hero.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As well, grim tidings of some sort have darkened the mood of old sage Xalvierre... knight-captain Corazelle has imposed structure on the knights, but everything seems tense... high priest Narvithex is always at the old king's ear...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Actually, that kind of thing is often repeated in those exact words by one courtier to another, sometimes passing between the same two people for the second time in a matter of minutes. The impression you get is that there are maybe five or six self-willed beings in the room, discounting yourselves and the two mortals present - one a flautist in Miaja's orchestra, the other an old <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and tired-looking butler.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Formal performances and so on are due to start soon, so if there's anywhere you want to sneak off to, anyone you want to conspire with or interview, or whatever, now's the time.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, Blossom and Eikichi have just thundered into a wide hall that House Cathak has been excavating under the Hedgehog mountain range. They're here to destroy or at least steal the Earth-Shaping Stone that allows the mining to proceed as quickly as it has, but said stone's just been picked up and pocketed by a huge, armor-clad Dragon-Blood hefting what looks like a gigantic <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> smith's hammer. Beside him, Cathak Kalza is sheating her reaper daiklave dramatically at her side and settling into a combat stance. Around both are a contingent of guards, and some miners who are huddling at the corners of the room.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's comfortably in position in case things go awry. There's not that much he needs to know, either - win the humans back or take them by force, then this place gets reshaped soon anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not even enough setup for a team monologue. Ugh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi tosses his hair impatiently.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The only person Ir might benefit from a strategy session with is Tatsuya himself, and he'll have to instigate that one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya's currently hiding behind a pillar, though he keeps shifting and putting his hands in his pockets. Something seems to trouble him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's rather easy to find him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Well, no it isn't.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But, it's a lot easier than it would be if you didn't already know where to look. She still needs to wander the edge of the room to just the right angle and then actually walk forward out onto the dance floor to make sure it's him. Luckily the dancers themselves have clockwork precision, and she times it not to get in anyone's way.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's some dancing, some gossip, some feasting - although, if you pay attention, none of the actual lords and ladies in attention eat anything substantive. All throughout, the court orchestra plays background music, the twelve foot tall green woman who controls it lounging and sometimes outright sleeping in its vicinity. Then, Ir's... sponsor? Keeper? Steps forward to address the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> circle of fae around the throne.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I've a new one - a great one. She can match our guest, I've no doubt." This appears to rouse Miaja from her nap, while at the same time the king and a variety of nobles mutter gravely to themselves and each other.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir finds herself being pushed and prodded to the edge of the faerie orchestra, where she finds herself staring at a motley of seeming humans and plant-creatures, behind all of whom a green woman lounges like a tiger on a broad dais. Green woman ("Miaja"): "Then... you'll no longer wish my-" "Quite the contrary! You might have more to learn."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's tetchy enough just about being here that the pushes and prods better take the hint when she moves in the right direction.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Miaja eyes Ir. "So... visitor. You're a musician?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'm lots of things." Ir snaps out her arm and extends her wrist up, fingers arched as if holding the neck of an imaginary fiddle, and Iscariot slithers across her bare shoulders to gather in just the shape they're waiting for. "Musician's one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Miaja's eyes light up. "And a magician! Where did you get it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The end of another world." Poetically true, especially in the Pneuman tradition with regards to the First Age. "It's a key. I just keep finding different locks."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This appears to delight and amaze pretty much Ir's entire audience; the faeries gasp or titter to themselves or even coo like children. Miaja, for her part, just stares with glittering eyes. "Oh. Ohhh that's lovely. But... it's older than you, I think. And so am I."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's right hand rises and his anima spreads out like fanning wings, blue-gold light framing a barrage of obsidian that clatters off the Dynasts' armor, leaving them unharmed.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're not gonna want to turn around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Miaja: "And you're just one pair of hands, in the end. Can you do this?" Her entire orchestra moves as one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile---<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Yeah. Reason for that is, I'm mortal. Y'all, well...Y'all come from circumstances."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Funny thing about that. I look around and I'm not the only one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Essence flares in the Cathak mines. A formation of soldiers goes charging forward, imbued with Cathak Zoltet's inspiring flames, only to be cut down near-instantly by a hail of sorcery. Cathak Kalza, blazing like a comet, charges into the Solar ranks like a woman possessed, but blow after blow is parried or dodged depending on its target.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Miaja's orchestra plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRWq53IFXVQ<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a jaunty tune that puts one in mind of warm breezes and sandy shores. It's literally enchanting, but Ir and Tatsuya both get the idea that the sorcerous, addictive properties of the music currently sliding off them like water would off a duck aren't even intentional - the green fairy's just that enthusiastic.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hrmph! Pitiful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The pale woman playing a flute at the edge of the orchestra can barely keep up with the goblins and wood sprites, and it's impossible to ignore the few sour notes she issues, but Miaja merely looks upon her with a patient, magnanimous pity.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eventually, the song concludes, and two by two the eyes of the court turn to Ir. Miaja's certainly do. Her expression says: show me what you got.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hmph. Tatsuya watches from the rafters, looming over everything like some kind of phantom. He's still wary of anything moving against Ir, despite the relaxed mood... Miaja's good.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi holds the Linchpin back like a scorpion's tail, and the sorcerer's anima tinges green and white. After a moment, his eyes and Kalza's burn the same, and Kalza staggers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Ir's better.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir listens, takes the mood in of the song, notes that the flautist's bit doesn't really play -- probably because it's bullshit she's here at all -- and realizes that even if most of these aren't really people in the strictest sense, they're trapped in a martial paradigm that's contradicted by them not being able to do shit. So let's work that into the idea of going home.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "This is an old song, from far away. But it's about being home, and being willing to fight for that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmnJ1FZv9ZU<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's turn at the stage is loud, grinning, and swaggering in tone: an intentional provocation. She's not looking to start a fight, per se, but she is trying to get peoples' blood racing. For the mortals here that seems to be a serious problem.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Feet tap. Ears twitch. The nobles of the Daylit Court wake up a little, as late as it is; the old, weary king is rubbing at his eyes, the high priest at his side is looking jumpy, the knight-captain is pacing back and forth like a caged beast. Miaja's perched on her stand like a gargoyle now, eyeing Ir almost hungrily, and when the song concludes the room bursts into riotous applause <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and cheering.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Ah... eh... exc-excellent! Oh, my, yes. Love... lovely...!" That's the king, who's not actualy raised his voice to be heard by the entire court for the entire night. His attending priest makes soothing motions at him, and the princess sitting nearby, clad almost entirely in white veils, raises a long finger to her chin in a gesture of growing intrigue. Soon, she's leaning over to <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> whisper to the monarch, and though what actually passes between them i obscured by a round of congratulations for the raksha lady who brought Ir to the court in the first place, pretty soon an elfin majordomo is tugging at one of Ir's sleeves.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The princess would like to meet her, it seems.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Elsewhere, a storm of crashing swords and burning hammers are just rebounding one after the other off Spite's Linchpin. There's a real madness in Kalza's eyes - she knows what Eikichi did to her memories, and she's going to exact a price for it come hell or high water.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's eyes flash too, and unlike the swordmaster or the general, his attack hits home. Looks like it was Hell that came.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's no real surprise. That is how it usually goes in the stories.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will bid Iscariot return to its decorative form -- she makes it look nice, since she's pretty certain not all of that hunger in Miaja's eyes was for her alone -- and accept the summons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, Ir doesn't have to play along, strictly speaking. If she wants to, though, she's ushered to a balcony adjoining but not actually directly open to the main hall. She walks past a pair of guards who uncross and re-cross their halberds mechanically to find herself staring besides Naeva, who's a tall, spare figure so completely enfolded by white robes and veils that the only features <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> of hers that can be made out at the moment are the long, indigo-hued fingers with which she clutches the balcony railing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Naeva: "You've... you're different. Where do you come from. Not the mountains?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Guessing this one's no mortal either.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh, no, Naeva's almost certainly a full-fledged Raksha. Does Tatsuya move to monitor the meeting, incidentally, or does he have other priorities in the court?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll stick close. Separating Ir could be a ploy, though it didn't seem like one... but it never hurts to be careful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Not from the mountains. Not from the seas beyond them, either, but that's closer."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You've met my people before. You will again."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom sweeps through a few katas and makes a mystic gesture, flinging dozens of molten bolts through the air towards the Dragonblooded! Kalza is overcome by the terrible heat, and Zoltet's clothing and pouches rip and melt as a glowing hot jewel falls out and bounces to the ground!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Naeva: "Were you - were you made by someone else?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No scion of House Cathak expects to go out like Kalza just did. And yet, there she goes, screaming and collapsing into ash and carbon. Zoltet recoils as the Earth-Shaping Jewel falls away from him, and Eikichi can tell that its tenuously-maintained geomantic aura's just collapsed around it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "HA! Now the Pylon is ours alone!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Zoltet: "You... you!!" In the distance, you can hear the press of boots - the soldiers guarding the outside of the mine are going to reach you soon! Beside the ruins of Kalza's armor, the Dragon-Blood's reaper daiklave has somehow found its sheath, and lies pristine on the stone of the floor.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Pass unscathed to the yellow springs!" Blossom gestures again, and a small mote of fire leaps from her hand to the slain Dragonblood. The blue flames quickly spread, devouring the body but, curiously, leaving her personal effects intact.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gods, the shy stammering.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The goal is to see that the fewest new blood vendettas possible are sworn tonight. We might stay in the single digits.<br>

The others don’t even need any special sense to feel the disorienting rebalancing as so many Beasts begin to leave. Cav’s Conestoga confirms that twenty-three kindred and one of the People are leaving the building. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yep. Everything. Also whatever weird shit Cavanaugh got from those diaries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's not like he has anyone in particular to keep secrets for.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blythe stops Wilson when he’s reading her the transcript of the diaries. “Wait, three siblings in Los Padres?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "That's what it says."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Beyond the hunts, I mean.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the early morning, long after everything has settled down, KJ hears a knock on her door.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blythe: “I guess I didn’t really know Franks well enough to understand if he’s speaking literally or symbolically. Three actual siblings seems unlikely. But Circle ritual repeats things in threes. It’s their religion, after all. Maiden, Mother, Crone.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "You think he means witches?"<br>

Long night. What does this all mean? She's got less reason to hate Count Bren than she thought, and it might be best to reconcile him and the target if possible.. Cavanaugh doesn't deserve what's happening here. At least not more than anyone else in the Invictus. But this 'illness', the timing of it.. the mentions of amnesia earlier. And whatever the heck is in those diaries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blythe: “No one else lives out there.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She hears the knock literally - her bedroom is basically above the front door - but flicks on a security camera feed to see who's there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It’s blurred. A kindred. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ wanders down the street, humming and texting. Here's what she's going to do, then: go over with the staff and ghouls just how this arrangement is running so far. It's been a few weeks, and there haven't been any major *issues* in feeding rights or keeping track of who passes through the area.. but could that be because they aren't keeping track well enough? Also, the ghouls probably need their fix.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Wilson: <We're neighbours, so I'm hoping to run into her shortly. Any particular reason?><br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That reminds her. To Frances: <So: Free real estate!><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: <Yes, if you're feeling up to it><br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: <She had a rough night.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <Ended well, but still.><br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances texts back a picture of a half dozen empty chocolate containers on her unmade bed. <:I> <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Tommy: <Sorry, Deacon, I was using perhaps excessively-modern slang. SMS does physically exist.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "I've got a pilot program that needs a pilot. It's a bit of a brainchild of mine. And I thought that choosing you would have an especially, um, symbolic meaning. That you could appreciate." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Leisurely: <Okay. I'll be ready in a few minutes. If you could give me a ride I'd appreciate it.> <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When is that thing Sol invited Wilson to, anyway?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Frances- ok, KJ needs to actually sit down again. It's getting hard to walk and tap. She'll drop onto her own damn stoop rather than going through to the back alley. To Frances: <I have literally just been to Lindt. Do you need a refill?><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy can hear the front door open, shortly followed by a crash of paper. "- of a bitch, this place is a mess." Sauer comes into the back holding a giant black matte suitcase. "I knocked over some stuff. Sorry." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy is genuinely speechless for a bit here. "...You want me to head up one of your projects? The most I ever did for you guys before is bust kneecaps and get chased out the woods by some sort of fuckin' bear."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Wilson, belatedly: <I'll pass on the warm fuzzies!> Frost is a nice guy, isn't he? It's hard to reconcile with what people used to say.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I hope it's a project that can afford to get fucked up," he adds.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: <Of course. I'll be over in a half hour.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After checking in with Baron Lakewood one more time and telling the girls to keep an eye on the house and its new guest, Cav will set off for Leisurely's place.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "Well, it's meant to help prevent you from getting...messed up, actually." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances: <No im getting fat> <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The event is tonight, according to the email Wilson received. The Eastern Columbia building downtown. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That gets his interest. With eyebrows raised: "Whuddaya mean?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: <You can't get fat because we're undead><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Any mention of a dress code, cover charge, reading list, anything like that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: <This was like the #1 attraction.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances: <It's a state of mind> <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> God, Wilson has no idea who's going to be there or what people are going to be doing. The last time he walked into a room this blind was the night he got introduced to Court.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There isn't a dress code, although the general crowd Solitude hangs out with means, y'know, dress up. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: <You can't get fat because you don't deserve it. You've got a mind gym.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson goes to call Cora to bring the car around before he remembers he gave them the night off. Guess he's driving himself. Can't fill the flask after all.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav is dressing loud tonight: a blue tie to go with his black suit, rather than his usual matching black tie.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's been a few months since Wilson drove, and it's been a few decades since he drove to get somewhere on purpose, but they make these cars basically idiot-proof these days and your phone will read the directions to you out loud in a patient nursemaid voice.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Leisurely's house is completely different from the last time Cav was there. All the trash has been cleaned up, for one. Leisurely greets him at the door in a sky-blue cocktail dress, her cornflower yellow hair combed out and pinned up, rather than in her usual braids. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "Well, in your...emphasis...you get exposed to a lot of danger. I thought that, well, you shouldn't have to be alone all the time. So, I talked to Presbyter Sauer and she said she had something that might help." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Good evening, Leisurely. You look fantastic." And her dress matches...his tie. Coincidence, or remote viewing? Best not to think about it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer clears a space for the suitcase on a desk. "How do you feel about minor outpatient surgery? Also, you don't have any fillings, do you?" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's wearing a gently pinstriped dark blue-gray suit and his tie has some kind of diamond pattern on it. Nora had them on the right side of the closet which is the 'wear this if there are going to be people' side.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The textstorm seems to be clearing. KJ gets up and heads inside, through the townhouse to the alley and the office. Now, who's on duy tonight..<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To tell the truth (in the privacy of her own head) she's a bit worried. These recent events have made her aware just how shitty mortal agents, ghoul or otherwise, might be at keeping track of a vampire who doesn't want to be tracked.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Leisurely beams. "Thank you. Are you planning on exhibiting yourself tonight?" She walks with him back to the car and gets in. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I uh..." The Deacon would blush, if he could spare it. Vitae's a bit tight after that run-in out in the canyon. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I have a few silver fillings," he mutters. "Why? What kind of- what are you talking about?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav grimaces. "We'll see. I've got something planned, but the feel in the room has to be right."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "Well...what if we could be with you, all the time?" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer lifts a scalpel. "Silver's fine. Some of the modern composite mixtures can disrupt radio frequencies if they're too close. Should be good." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Speaking of feeling, the night overhead is cloudy. It fits with the strange mood that's settled over the city lately. It's hard to put a name to it, but...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh man, are you going to chip me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He follows that one up: "Oh man, you are going to chip me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Wilson and Cav's cars arrive, a valet ghoul either directs Nora towards parking or takes Cav's car off his hands. The building's entrance is clear of passerby, and the usual passage into the tunnel towards the basement is marked discreetly. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson tips the ghoul and heads in. He hasn't noticed anyone yet; psyching himself up to believe that leaving the house was a good idea is giving him a sort of tunnel vision.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The massive industrial elevator takes them, in whatever order they arrive, down into the pleasant - fountained and decorated - lobby leading to the larger laboratories. For Cav, this should be familiar. For Wilson, there's a massive industrial elevator in the basement of the Eastern Columbia Building that leads to a pleasant lobby far underneath. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also, the signs in the lobby have...strange names on the little directory plaques. Rocketry? Botany? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's weird. This is weird. Coming here was a mistake.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> His beast seems to be very quiet, though, for once. Must be the music piped in through excellent speakers. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "We're not going to chip you. You're not a dog." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: "A chip would be totally insufficient for our needs." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Last time Cav was here, he was with...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Whatever. They all made their choices.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Okay, okay. Classy-weird. Much better than weird-classy. Classy-weird gets you Vincent Price. Weird-classy gets you Hannibal Lecter.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Can't keep living with ghosts.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does Cav go straight in to the room marked Exhibits? Or does he linger in the lobby? Leisurely seems content to follow him around as he will. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll linger in the lobby for a few minutes, but will head into Exhibits if he doesn't run into somebody who wants to talk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He rubs the back of his neck. It's got a pebbled texture. "So... you kinda make it sound like a chip."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Did the email say what room the meeting was in?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Speaking of the lobby, there's no one Cav will recognize, just a balding, white-bearded man who keeps checking his pocket watch. He'll bow politely when he sees them. "Visionary. Slave." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It did not. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's ghouls report all systems running well. As it turns out, once you set up the lines of governance, there's not much hands on work to do if you just want a base level of functioning. Now, aggressive expansion and crisis management is something else...but she doesn't seem to be doing that at the moment. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: "No. I thought you might want company, not just a knowledge that we know where you are. A...reference book and helper, that sort of thing. A radio transmitter so you can hear us, a microphone so we can hear you, and a camera so we can see what you're seeing." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ugh. At this point Wilson starts looking for people. Who does he see first?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Before Cav can correct him, he'll notice a familiar face walk into the lobby and look around as if he's lost. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy quirks his brow and raises his phone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav breaks into a smile.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Leisurely: "I didn't know Wilson Frost was in our little group."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, there's nowhere to expand to, is there? Not that the oldschool Invictus obsession with territory is really what matters. "OK. 'Gadget', over the next week I'd like you to put together a survey on the kindred who've been feeding here - we're going to take names and home territories at minimum, and whatever else they'll give you without getting hostile. Expect a lot of lies, but I'll be following up on those until people get the message."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "'Quimby', I want you to look into defenses against telepathy. Beg or buy access to peoples' libraries - I've discovered that we're being surveilled in a way which may or may not be possible to prevent. And 'Claw', how are we doing on recruiting rude dudes with attitudes? Would we be prepared if a turf war suddenly broke out over Disneyland? I want to be."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Leisurely's face turns from a placid, friendly, vacant smile into a terrified, stricken grimace. She turns and walks towards the bathroom. "Um- I...You go ahead-" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...<br>

"Best not to talk for this one," says Clarabelle. Sauer's little hands move against his skin. What she's doing exactly, he can't see.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer backs up, her hands dyed red with blood. "Yeah, just give it a moment. Also, seriously, don't move your head." <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After a while, there's a faint pop that sounds far off in the distance, and the pressure recedes.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle explains: "That's a transmitter in your inner ear. Should be able to receive signals through rock, water, um, cloud cover..." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, it's not that big of a lobby, and Leisurely didn't use obfuscate, so unless his attention was fixed elsewhere Wilson saw everything. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: "It should. Okay, so this one is going to feel weird. But, look, again, all your receptors are dead. No pain. Also, really, the eye doesn't have a lot of pain receptors to begin with, so even if..." She trails off. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “God damn it, just do it.”<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle holds Tommy's hand. "Maybe...close your right eye. Keep the left one open, though." <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer lifts the scalpel, and then all he can see is a blurry combination of greys and blacks. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Hey, hand me that thing in the case."

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's more uncomfortable waiting, and then Sauer stands up, wiping at his eye with some cotton wads. "Okaaayy..." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She stands in front of the display one more time, and presses a button. Tommy's vision in his left eye comes back swiftly. He can see even better, actually. Everything looks more crisp. "Yeah, that works. See? I told you it'd be easy." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He closes his left eye, opens his right. ”Gonna take some getting used to.”<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle turns to her computer.

In the bright moonlight falling down from the great opening in the ceiling, some far distance above, they can see him well: a man some years past late middle age, slightly bent with age, still with a head full of white hair, wearing a quiet suit that seems neither unfashionably bulky or fashionably fitting. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hey, it's Sol.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Meanwhile, a cyborg-vampire is running around the streets of Orange County, up to….well, what is he up to, anyway? With the seeming end of the Sponger affair, Tommy has some free time. Come to think of it, it’s the first real break he’s had in months, the tempo of sorting things out for other people having kept his schedule full. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What does he want to do? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And is this first feeling of existential freedom liberating, or horrifying? Hm. Clarabelle must have rubbed off on him a bit, there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also, why is no one returning KJ’s regular jibes and jabs? It’s like all of her social contacts, normally buzzing, have gone silent. No new texts…<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy spends more than a little time trying to see if he, like, can spot a bunch of wires, electronics, etc. hanging in space in the desk mirror in his room beneath Soria's peublo mission. No such luck. Still, as he sits on his bed and kneads his throat, he has a moment of clarity. How is this freaking thing powered? Does it have batteries? Are they gonna have to like, put batteries <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, Tommy could ask…<br>

Four people all going quiet at the same time. Shit. Shit, are they onto her? Is this a stingray - or just a sting?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Okay the first thing here is to lock ALL the doors.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The basement is a little less crowded now that Sponger has moved out. Word from the grapevine is that Bren’s legal people withdrew the accusation of assault. No official news yet, but it’s a welcome bit of gossip. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson shakes Solitude's hand. "No, no trouble at all. I appreciate the invitation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "There's some remarkable work going on here."<br>

Until it's official, and probably a while after that, he's gonna remain skeptical. Too much stuff has happened for him to trust Bren's 'legal people'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He mutters the words and looks very hard at the palm of his hand. "Hey, anyone at the computer? Do you need a computer for this? Is there a mobile app?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Step 2: get out a burner phone. Can KJ connect to the network without triggering any pings..? Odd, it seems to work just like her main device. So what if it's not her but them?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I have questions," he says to nobody.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: “Hello? I’m here. Um, I don’t think there’s an app for this…what do you want to know?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Step 3: Note down all the names of the people who've gone dark around the same time tonight.. and work out, later, how they're connected. It's probably just an event or dinnertime, come on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Solitude looks back at the rows of the garden. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. I can assure you that it’s more impressive once you know what’s been done at the cellular level. But, that’s botany for you. Not my field. I just appreciate the smell of the flowers.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Quelling paranoia, Baron Anaheim laughs at herself. But the whole episode, combined with this weird thing Leisurely Foster's been talking about, gives her an idea..<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So you have to like, sit down at your computer to help me out? What if you're like, sleeping, or something." He lets that hang for a bit before continuing: "I uh, you didn't put like... a bomb in me, did you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "These are probably things I should have hashed out before I let you guys put stuff in me. I don't even know how you guys did it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ received a present, last week, from a secret admirer. The money is money, the bullets she's had traced to the Wilderness Commission.. but that leaves the gun and the note, both things you *handle*. It's not only mysterious stoners who can draw out information from the Blood alone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: “Well, I just have to have a radio signal, I think. I’m not quite up to speed on the exact mechanical details. I think it has something to do with sending tiny electronic impulses into the parts of your body that need to be used. Or…something like that.” She pauses. “A bomb?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She unlocks enough doors to head over to the office and pick them up. The gun, first: ignoring ghouls who're finding out just now that there's a mysterious rifle in the box on that side of the room, KJ sits down on a table, stills herself, and wraps both hands around the long shaft on her lap<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You could do it, though, right? I mean, how could I tell?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: “Oh…I don’t really know how to make bombs. Or how to put them in people. I guess if you hear ticking, you should start to worry.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh." He reticulates his fingers on-camera. "So you don't really... this was mostly Sauer's idea, then?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I just had this sudden panic that I was going to wake up in the middle of stealing like, a diamond or something, with you guys remotely controlling me while I'm daysleeping. That's, that's crazy right."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I don’t think we can make you do things.” Clarabelle thinks about it. “I wanted something like this to help people who were helping us. So I asked Presbyter Sauer for her help, and she came up with this device. Devices. I guess that makes me like Steve Job!” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 'Oh man,' Tommy thinks to himself privately. 'I'm definitely gonna die'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That reminds me." He takes out his phone, covering a portion of his screen with his thumb while he flips through messages. "KJ had some kind of app I needed to install. I might need Sauer's help to make sure it's not some sort of... virus I guess."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "What is your field? If that's not a rude question."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "How's this thing powered? Did Sauer say?" He installs the app. "Do I need to stand next to a magnet or something? Would that be bad? What if I jump in a pool?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's so special about this garden anyway? It grows in moonlight, not sunlight?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle: “I’m not sure what it’s running on, exactly. But it’s waterproof. And magnetproof. I guess if you were around some kind of jamming device, there might be reception problems…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Good to know, I guess."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How did this go again? Baron Murray wasn't a very good teacher, or at least she didn't want to appear to be. On one level it comes so naturally to KJ, the shadows at her fingertips, the gun as a representation of its owner - after all, they don't kill people by themselves. On another.. she's not really sure what she's doing. Just how it feels. Maybe she really does need access to that trove of books, once Cavanaugh's free later on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Okay, well, I'm not really doing anything important, so.. I'm gonna go... do my own thing. Kay, thanks... uh bye."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The warehouse office has people discussing trivia, movements of money and of people. A crowd is easy to shut out, unlike an individual. KJ lets their voices carry her into the barrel and through.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He sits in silence, eyes narrowed. Nothing? No voices? Okay, good. He turns to his phone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <how the fucks this thing work><br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ’s sense of sight leaves her for a moment, and rushes into the rifle. She can hear…voices, faintly. They’re discussing some sort of…inventory order. Then, that dissolves into a smell of cordite and gunpowder, and a series of distant bangs. She can see a woman at a firing range, short brown hair and protective eyewear, making a series of perfect circles in a target…and then she sees it being placed in the duffel bag, <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> along with the bullets. She can see the same woman, making a note of some kind on a clipboard. KJ can peer over her shoulder…and sees her marking a number of rifles set back into a storage system of some kind…it looks as if she’s making some sort of clandestine adjustment. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then, she can see the duffel bag sitting in the passenger seat of a tan Honda, next to the woman, who’s breaking the law by speaking on her phone while driving. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's illegal, lady.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Yeah, I got it. You’ll have to give me some more time for the rest. The Commission’s a bit more relaxed about this stuff, so they won’t notice it’s missing for a day or two. Yeah. I have some idea.” A pause. “Sure. Same amount next time. I don’t know yet. She’s only got two hands. Maybe some stuff from the library. Uh huh.” Another pause. “Ok. I’ll lose this number. Let me know what the new one is when <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you want to talk.” The phone ends, the car comes to a halt, KJ sees her house outside the car’s window, the woman gets out, and the vision ends. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Criminality aside, KJ's taking mental note after note.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A sort of natural pecking order establishes itself around you, is built into the very terrain - community leaders and logistical organizers tend to set up shop in the structures at the very center of city of glass, and their immediate allies and adjutants are just below them, and so on and so forth.

The raksha, incidentally, have well and truly had their backs broken - a few mutants and monsters still boil up from the deepest <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> fens every now and again, but they simply haven't got the critical mass required to be much more dangerous than the rest of the local fauna.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Perhaps the most obvious element of the society now budding within the city of glass that wasn't your idea is a rare but strongly-held reverence for the power of the skies and the ancient air dragon Garuda; she's credited for having sheltered many of the refugees through the worst of the storm, and has supposedly blessed a few women with sorcerous power.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, that's nice. As long as she doesn't try to erect any unsightly rock pillars for them to periodically duck behind.<br>

If Gyozin and any of his allies survived the detonation of the Linchpin, they haven't been seen - they must have really gone to ground, used some kind of magic to flee the area unseen. They were certainly smart to - the Realm won't be taking this place back any time soon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let's go find Nexus!<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir spends time at the helm, in her room, in the distillery, or down with Errant. The Heavensward gets where it needs to go.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After about a week of travel, you cross water - not one of the many small creeks and other waterways, but a massive body of water that can barely be seen across by the human eye. This is the River of Tears, flowing north out of the Yanaze, and it's dotted with skiffs, barges, and other trading vessels.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi holds his breath.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Here's a question: should we pretend to be an actual boat?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> However, it would be a good idea to consider how you'll be traveling and presenting yourselves.

It'll catch up, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "We're sure. Um. Wow, it sounds really weird when I put it like that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Our past reputations are great.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Perhaps... too great.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nah, they're pretty great. We just don't need people poking around while we do our thing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, to Ying: "It makes sense to me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "I didn't say it was wrong! Just, a reminder of how weird my life is."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway there's not really a subtle place to park a flying ship nearby Sijan, which is on pretty flat terrain and bounded on most sides by branches of the River of Tears.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "We should probably go the diplomatic route rather than trying to hide the Heavensward."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But... maybe...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a long shot, but if you wait a few hours for that fog bank, dip behind those trees... yes, Ir can nestle the Heavensward in a handy hollow right in the middle of some nearby forest, though it'd give the lot of you a several hours' walk to Sijan proper and might mean that a random hunter or explorer finds your ship at some point down the line.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Walking is good and fine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also, Ir and Blossom will be riding.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi has a little cloud to sit on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But stashing the Heavensward in a crevasse is basically what they should have been doing from the jump. So it's not the worst thing in the world when they make sure that everything is copacetic before they head out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soooo the forest you're using for cover is on the outer edge of a huge wooded shadowland called the Black Chase, but you're in its outermost peripheries which are safely within the sunlit world and, in general, the dead around Sijan are known to be very well-behaved as befits the city's stellar reputation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now, when you say stellar-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well. Great.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So it is that your actual landing and disembarking is pretty uneventful. If you're particularly uncertain you may want to leave Sondok or just some blood apes back to guard the vessel, but generally your approach to Sijan is calm and uneventful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We've got enough erymanthoi to leave some behind to guard the ship.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Lady and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are descending to the forest floor. Please do not touch the animals, understand the monoliths, or speak with the dead. Thank you and good luck."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And then Ir brings the heavenly ship in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's still a little grouchy about the fastening belt Blossom put on Eikichi's chair for when the ship lands.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But he claps all the same.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Safety first.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Of greatest interest is the city itself. The closer you get to it, the more you become convinced that it's an actual ghost town - there are great structures of marble and granite and basalt stretching out before you, but no sound or motion at all visible on or between them. That's not a surprise to either Eikichi or Blossom - they know that the portion of Sijan that's above ground <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> is for the dead, not the living, and that mortals only go there on specified nights to keep things clean and give offerings.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Populated Sijan is underground, and sure enough you find an archway and down-sloping tunnel build neatly into the hillside so as not to distract from the majesty of the tombs and sepulchers directly before you.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom sniffs dismissively.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sijan's famous for its funereal prowess throughout all the Scavenger Lands. Members of the the Funeral Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers ('the Funeary Order' for short) are in call all over the hundred kingdoms, for they know how best to hold funerals, arrange graves, and give offerings so as to forestall any kind of vengeance from beyond the grave - crucial in a land so <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> riven by wars, betrayals, and murders as this one. As well, anyone who's anyone comes to Sijan to die, or at the very least arranges to be buried there afterward, because they're sure to be granted expansive stature and grave goods so as to render them veritable emperors and empresses of the next world.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom and Eikichi know that the influence of the enigmatic deathlords is, surprisingly enough, not felt in Sijan to great degree - most of those nearby have some interest in it, to be sure, and the "Walker in Darkness" is rumored to even have a secret embassy there, but no underworld power rules the place. They needn't be wary of attack by Reckoning's like - at least, not as a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> matter of course.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi wasn't thinking about that at all. You can tell because it hasn't poisoned his mood all day.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, you've soon walked down into the darkness to find yourselves at a toll booth/waystation sort of area at the mouth of a long tunnel. There are black-clad guards and a man in a heavy robe with silver bracer on his wrists who'd like to know who you are, what brings you to Sijan, how long you'll be staying, if you're aware of the city's laws and if you have your entrance fees at <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the ready.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What're we lookin' at here, anyway? Is the Circle just in full regalia, with silver spears and circling orbs and red jade armor and suchlike plainly visible?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's in street clothes, with a weird coiled set of strange jewelry curled around her arms.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's there in his long plated jacket, surrounded by pieces of a demon queen. He doesn't seem to be visibly armed, though, and there's no sign of any demons in his wake.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom doesn't really have regalia as such, which is a distressing oversight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well she's got really intimidating bangs.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, the receptionist, so to speak, blanches at your approach, but it's not visible since he's in long cowled robes and furthermore kind of standing back in a little booth thing. Nonetheless, you espy a runner heading down the hall as you approach, and more guards approach from out of the dark as you speak to him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Who are you? What brings you here?<br>

The interpreter scowls to herself and averts her eyes. Doplen maintains a steely composure except that the speed with which he wrings and flexes his hands and wrist approximately triples.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the sign flashes, the air around her body explodes in a sunburst and radiant, shining mail coils from the light itself around her body.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's good to be off the boat for awhile; around people.<br>

Things proceed smoothly from here, unless you're of a mind to toss a shaft in the gears. There's ample room in the tunnels for Errant, Eikichi gets all the snacks he wants, and the lot of you are escorted by one of Doplen's own functionaries through the entrance tunnel and into Sijan proper.<br>

He's enjoying the new climate too, though it's a bit warmer down here -- she might need to get him a shearing. She'll play it by ear. "You've certainly gotten shaggy, though," she mutters in his ear as they walk. The warhorse snorts defensively.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The city opens out beneath you as you leave the entrance tunnel, revealing a great underground complex of hewn, crystal-lit stone. Catwalks stretch from stalactite-tower to stalactite-tower and processions wind their way around the twisting streets and alleys below.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "We splitting up here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You're led to what is apparently a high-end hostel, the Dragon's Tooth, and given the equivalent of a penthouse suite - the chambers at the exact bottom of a great column of hanging stone, all well-apportioned with all manner of luxuries. If you pay attention to the words being exchanged by your guide and the proprietor and the local guards and so on, you get the idea that this is <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> meant to look like a sleazy but not actually illegal favor being done for a high up city official who's basically treating some personal friends.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soon you've got your chambers to yourselves.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So the Heavensward needs what, a permit to dock?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "There's probably an agent somewhere in Sijan we can buy a permit from and show to a dockmaster in Nexus. Or something like that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya: "Yeah. I'm - not clear on how that'd work, but there's gotta be some kind of process in place, right?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Sounds like something I should at least be there for, though, y'know. Language barrier. Blossom?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, here's how it works. Unlike Sijan, Nexus is free of top-down bureaucratic control by any governing body, and all the space there is completely free for productive beings to use as they see fit. Specifically, every inch of the city is privately owned, and there are specific cartels that jointly control all the city's available docking space.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> However, a conundrum arises, since generally docking space is taken to be the edges of the river flowing through the city. When you think about it...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Seems like we could just rent a plot of land and park there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Say we're building a three-story building there. Say, oh, 120 twenty paces by 30 or so.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "I'll bet I can find the right person."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Damn straight."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...when you think about it, there's no way that literally all the air in Nexus is under private control, and a web of agreements and contracts ensure that like, most streets and things are free for anybody to walk around on so long as no one obstructs traffic. You don't actually need a special dock of your own - you could just moor yourselves sufficiently high in the air and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> stretch a rope ladder down to street level, and who's to say you're in their territory?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Can the Heavensward even masquerade as a freshwater ship for the purposes of docking the usual way at Nexus?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now, if you want a proper dock such that teams of workmen can unload stuff from your ship or do repairs or whatever, you'll probably want to rent space near the roof of a building that itself is on or near the waterside, at which point Eikichi and Tatsuya can probably point you to a few smart choices.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "While you two make those arrangements, Tatsuya and I should probably..."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He nods. "Probably too long. But, hell, it's been strange times."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After a moment she nods, and manages to only let the worry briefly flash across her face. "Sounds good, then."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir pauses. "And if you're not back by then. Where should we start looking?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...I'm not having another Crystal."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Velvet Room is easy to find in any thriving metropolis, even one that's underground, whose primary import is corpses, and whose primary export is funeral services. Tatsuya and Eikichi need simply wander the right way, look for intersections of a certain shape, and so on. It's getting towards the evening when they finally slip between two walls and find themselves in the foyer of <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the mysterious paradimensional thieves' guild and contraband clearing house they've worked for since Eikichi was mortal.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Last time Eikichi came in here, he wasn't glowing and clad in jade and orbited by a fragment of a Yozi.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Last time Tatsuya was here... no, he actually looked pretty similar. Although he was returning from a job, then, not looking to pick another one up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As usual, it's a long, low room lit by colored, heatless torches - purplish blue today - which shifts along its length from waiting room to a series of what look like shop counters to a high table at the end staffed by a hunched, hobgoblin-looking man and a statuesque woman.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Whichever suits your interest." Now then. Blossom would like to speak to a manager.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a thin man wrapped head to toe in black sitting in one of the chairs in the foyer/waiting area of the Velvet Room, and on the chair next to him is a glowing golden egg. Up ahead, someone in a long brown cloak is negotiating with one of the shadowy apparitions that serve as clerks or shopkeeps, and the main desk up ahead doesn't seem to be serving anybody so you're free to <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> walk right up.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Old reflex compels Eikichi to just stand cheerily behind Tatsuya while Tatsuya conducts business.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, this poor tea delivery woman doesn't know at all, but she can pass the message on, and her immediate superior can pass that message on, and so on and so forth. Soon Blossom and Ir find themselves being led along Sijan's streets by a minor functionary in the funeral order, traveling deeper and deeper into the markets and then stopping at and entering a squat-looking ziggurat <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> which, it must be said, is emblazoned with the symbol of the Guild.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tatsuya draws himself up to his full height and looks abruptly serious.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then a second, then a gigantic, misshapen corpse is pulling itself over the side, and tiny bodies are spilling down from it- but you don't get the chance to watch much more.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a horrible noise from above that sounds like some mixture of a moan and a sigh, and a hideous long, thin, spider-leg -- but too jointed to be a spider's leg -- descends from the darkness...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...and gently taps the sign.<br>

Blossom's put a long-range requisition for a defunct airship dock together, Eikichi and Tatsuya have checked in with the Velvet Room and appraised themselves of a big bundle of potential sidequests, and Ir got extremely drunk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She made pork buns!<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Also, sometime between the first morning and first afternoon since you stay in the city, a robed official arrives to let you know that the Funeral Order has a request for you.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You gotta be--<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She prods Eikichi with a finger. "How quickly do you think your sorcerer's sight could narrow that down?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sunlit-Dreaming Ying looks almost as rough as she feels. There's an extremely wobbly "SORRY - T" in a notebook that was in her lap when she came to, and a weird-looking drink that probably used to be an egg nearby, but these are not enough to make over for the head-splitting hangover Tatsuya left her to deal with.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Or Eikichi.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi squints at Blossom: "I'd have to catch them in the act. That means staying at least another night."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That is Blossom, right? Her face is so swimmy...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's down for helping the random commonfolk out as asked, even if that means staying a bit longer, but obviously it's the call of the people actually able to resolve this issue.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, for her part, has just come back from a brisk run through the streets around their lodgings.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh fuck off.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying just moans piteously. "Whyyyyy..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now that's some dedication.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's how you cure a hangover! Austere self-improvement!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir, meanwhile, has commandeered the kitchen to make Hangover Eggs.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're just normal eggs.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That's up to you. And Tatsuya, I suppose."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's words come out slowly. "We can do it if you want. I do want to stress, though, that every extra day you ask us to stay, and every favor you ask us, greatly multiplies the risk that the low profile you wanted us to keep will, uh, rise."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She offers the managers the option of cooking for the whole building. Do they accept?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It takes them a moment to determine that this isn't some kind of deliberate social trap, but no one in the River Province is going to turn down free real estate. Ir has the floor, if she needs it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir steps into the kitchen and runs it like a boss. The eggs come out every five minutes like clockwork, distributed evenly amongst the guests and then the staff.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "Tatsuya's busy, being a big dumb idiot, who just-- grrrr!" She huffs, smooths out her skirt, and calms slightly. "What for, even. Like, even aside from us being in a hurry."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The funerary official winces slightly, but doesn't look as though they've been made to reconsider. "Well... yes, we know. It does help that the great graveyard itself is up on the surface, out of sight of Sijan's actual denizens."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once the cooking is done, Ir emerges from the back with a two-foot-long peppermill in hand, and walks around the common room peppering the eggs to taste.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Eikichi: "I can prep the Heavensward to go either way. We could give it a night, and if there's nothing, we could move on."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Uggggggghhhhhhh. Fine. Fine. Whatever. I'm going back to bed."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She salutes him lazily with the peppermill and finishes her garnishes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then it's off to the Heavensward with Errant to make good on what she said.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Official: "The Order will be extremely grateful if you can clear this matter up, of course. Your cadre will be able to count on financial and diplomatic support, insofar as it is practical."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Works for Ir.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Practical," she echoes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "We'll need to bring our airship atop the mound to do this, at least at some point. Is that okay?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Official: "An air- ...you won't be landing it ON anything, will you? Some of the statuary is quite delicate."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "I'll put it up in the cloud cover so as not to scare off our quarry."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Just a question of airspace rights."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi staggers back up to his bed, and at the foot of it sees the three bags, two that contain gifts and one that, uh, used to. Oh well, they can roll exterminator fees into whatever financial support they're offering. The two still-intact bags that aren't covered in slime end up on Blossom's bed before Eikichi crashes for another couple of hours.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eh? What're these?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unless any of you challenge multiple city blocks to a duel or something, the day should pass without incident. Let me know if or when you move for the necropolis.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir heads out with Errant, returns to the Heavensward, stables her mount, says hi to Ami, chats with Sondok for a half-hour or so, then takes the helm and brings the airship around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This is a tricky problem... but, thankfully, the necropolis is a proper necropolis, one in which no expense was spared. You can't hide a ship in a normal graveyard, but you could probably slide the Heavensward veerrrrry carefully between that towering ziggurat on one side and that forest of dread obelisks on the other.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Between the shadows, obstructions, and inexplicable eerie mist, you'd be nice and hidden.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The smaller bag holds a pendant, white and yellow gold covered in age-smudged ideograms. A symbol of the sun recovered from some old ruin, with hundreds of marks on them. Blossom'll recognize that this is some dialect of Old Realm or other, but the meaning of the marks might take some effort to puzzle out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's very careful, especially when it comes to other people's ships.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The larger bag holds a fine wooden box, which contains three pieces of shaped Western tree rubber resting on felt. Two of them are cylindrical - Blossom finds that they fit nicely in the palms of her hands. The third is shaped like a crescent.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How sweet! Oh no, Blossom needs to start making gifts for the others...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is Eikichi awake yet?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sound asleep.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Uh- Ying?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's lying on the floor, but is still awake. "Wuzzat?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Do you know why Eikichi gave me these tiny sacks of dead beetles, labeled 'Just in case'?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She moves to sit up and look at Blossom. "He gave you -- what? Why would he- I guess that's why you're asking me, huh."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "They were tucked into the bags that had the other gifts..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "No idea. I don't think Tatsuya knows either, but it's kinda hard remembering last night..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She shakes one of the bags dubiously. "Are they... special beetles?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "They must be, right? It'd be weirder if they were just, normal beetles."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Dead normal beetles. In a bag."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Right."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir spends some time among the tombstones, playing sad music.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Will the rest of the circle simply hike their way up and meet Ir at the Heavensward?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi probably won't wake up naturally on his own until after dark, but other than that, yeah!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, they won't meet her by the Heavensward. That's the whole point of hiding the damn thing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's not particularly hard to find, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah, Blossom can ask Eikichi what the deal is when they're done with work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "When you're sad and lonely / And you haven't got a friend / Just remember, that death is not the end..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So will you first meet together prior to or post-sunset, and what'll you do? You've been told the locations of all the known recent break-ins/corpse thefts, if that helps.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Any pattern?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hopefully Blossom wakes Eikichi up a bit early so they can meet before sunset. They probably want to scope all this out before they lose the Sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Good question. You pore over the notes...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...yes, there's a definite pattern here, Eikichi can elucidate.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The grave robbery sites are just a mishmash that doesn't mean anything... from this angle." Eikichi rotates the map 90 degrees. "Can anyone see what our thieves are drawing now?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No? "These correspond to the stars that make up the constellation 'The Mask', tied to Jupiter. Intrigue, deception, trickery..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir doesn't bother glancing over. He's flirting with Blossom anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Hmm."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Don't say goodbye to me / Describe the sky to me / And if the sky falls, mark my words / We'll catch mockingbirds."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "My guess is, the next site they'll hit will be here." He points at the spot where the Mask's second eye will be.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Whose tomb is that, anyway?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "A moment." She steps aside and begins concentrating on the Essence-forms that make up the Infallible Messenger.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's very old. If you ask the Funeral Order, they'll send a runner off to the house of records and return to you with the information that a Lookshy general who died two hundred years ago was buried there at great expense.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Was she buried with anything that will explode when the tomb is breached?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mortician: "We-e-e-llll...." In truth there are most certainly sorcerous and geomantic traps laced through the structure, ones which should still be holding. Of course, traps haven't stopped any of the other attacks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're loathe to give you any of the details, unfortunately.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's fine. We're not going inside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...We're not going inside, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "You're going to make us protect a tomb and not tell us what's inside? I hope you don't expect us to actually enter it, then."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That depends on whether Blossom gets a response.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom doesn't receive a response for several hours, but she does get one. A six-winged cherub carved from chrome comes flitting in through a window to whisper into her ear in Yara's voice: "Not that I know, and I can't imagine why they would. I'll check, though."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No further word, though. Who knows how long it could take to check, or if there's anything to find?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We agreed to give them one night. Let's just stake the damn tomb out and see what happens.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To the others: "Probably not the Star-Chosen. That's good."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If Ir leans on the Sijanese before heading off to grab the Heavensward, she can make sure that the Squared Circle is furnished with a jade slip that should unlock the tomb in question, command words that will disable some of the traps, and knowledge of where to step so as to not trigger others.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The next time the mortician comes by, Ir corners him alone over near some mausoleum from a few hundred years before. It's hard to hear what she's saying, but her body language is very...forceful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Never say she never did nothing for ya.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anything else before you actually go up there? And once you do, what's the plan, a stakeout?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's sure as shit not going in there, though. That's on Tatsuya and Eikichi. That's their whole thing, isn't it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If Ying doesn't want to disturb Tatsuya, Eikichi'll bring Sondok at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hell yeah.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Agreed, a stakeout.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once Blossom, Eikichi, and Sondok meet up with Ir, she snaps Iscariot from a six-string into a spear. If she's doing this without the Sun's plate, she'll do it with her most familiar arm.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The great necropolis of sijan isn't exactly a wilderness, but a lot of the principles of hunting in, say, craggy mountains can easily be made to apply here when it comes to finding sight lines, covering positions, and quietly settling in for the long wit. Blossom's able to find the Circle a somewhat uncomfortable but completely circumspect perch atop the tomb of some rich merchant, <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> one that blocks sight of she and her fellows with statues of of the province's river gods.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir pushes up against one of the statue's sides, holding Iscariot behind her and between herself and the statue. Just so no light glints off the moonsilver.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Attuning herself to the spirits, Blossom's increasingly certain that she's come to the right place - or, at least, that Eikichi's found some separate weird thing to investigate. There are lots of ghosts up here in the necropolis, shuffling through the streets and alleyways, sitting or praying at their own or others' tombs, examining or exchanging trade goods. Some of them see you <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and follow you for a time; others are so vibrant that even the other members of the Circle catch glimpses.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But tonight, many of the unquiet dead look antsy, shifty, paranoid. They keep eyeing the sky fearfully or staying close to walls and tight alleyways. Around the tomb of the old general that you're staking out right now, almost none are in evidence - they're either all avoiding it, or those that would normally be present have been sealed or banished or something.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi and Ir, meanwhile, spot something of note in the world of the living: one of the living.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well shit.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You see, there hasn't been so much as a rat up here for all the hours you've been prowling around or sitting still and watching.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But, its shell glinting in the moonlight, a large bug of some kind - a beetle, maybe - has come crawling across the paviliion and up the door of the tomb. As you watch, it wriggles and pushes and struggles until it's squeezed itself through the crack between door and wall to disappear into the structure.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh Gods. It's not one of-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The fuck is that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You don't know - you're not an entomologist and anyway it was quite far away.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir looks over at Eikichi. Are we just gonna wait for it to come out from here, or...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You really had to strain your eyes to make it out at all, really. You just know that something small and rounded and shiny just squeezed its way into the tomb, and that it moved in the kind of scrambly way you associate with insects.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi nudges Blossom. Did she see that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "What?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "A bug just squeezed into the tomb."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...I can guess how it's gonna get the body out."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir pantomimes a goofy zombie walk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "As long as it doesn't eat whatever's left of the corpse."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That'd be gross."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "...If it hijacks the corpse, are we allowed to like, hurt it?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "No sense in pursuit. It has only one way out."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "It wasn't supposed to have any way in."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Are we going in after it, or...?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "They asked us to save the tomb, right? Not just catch the tomb raider."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Eikichi makes a good point. Ir, you and Sondok should stay at the entrance and keep it from escaping. Eikichi and I will go in and investigate."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir steps away from the statue and stretches. "Works for me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We-elll, you're supposed to just put a stop to this. Technically if this was the last body stolen, rather than the first saved, you'd still have done your job.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And it's not like they're your bosses.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah but Eikichi's butt hurts sitting on this statue.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sunlit-Dreaming Ying: "What about me?" She's been pretty quiet - first thing she's said all night, actually.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Ying: "You're with Blossom and Eikichi."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yes, Ying is there, too.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Works for me."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir goes over everything she learned from the mortician with Blossom, Eikichi, and Ying a second time. Just to be sure.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She hands over the jade talent for the door, too.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, if you want to gain entrance, you're to press your slip of white jade against the exact center of the door with the palm of your right hand, and then splay your left palm across the tips of your right hand's fingers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> By instinct, Eikichi lets Blossom handle the jade.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir hangs back from the others as they approach the tomb, finds a tall headstone to put her back against, and slides down to wait.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's no more than forty paces from the tomb's entrance, and anyone who walks out will see her waiting for them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Alright, Blossom presses the slip against the door as instructed.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nothing happens for a full minute, but that's how it's supposed to go - the activation's low-key, meant to deter and discourage. There's a faint vibration under Blossom's hands then, and finally the portal slowly grinds open - it doesn't swing in or out, but sinks into the floor.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You're given to notice, as it moves, that it's totally flush with its frame... except for a little spot on the right side that's been a teensy bit eroded or chipped or something. Guess that's how the bug got in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How recent is that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Good question-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Sondok: "Anything special about tomb robbers?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sondok, who bled into the world after the kids vanished, scowls. "It's ugly."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "No one dies forever in Hell. That's what they say, at least."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, the tomb extends before you. There's all kinds of jade inlay in the walls, and you can only see that by virtue of the moonlight behind you and any torches or caste marks you've chosen to light your path with because it's otherwise pitch black. It is, you're well aware, a hellish maze in which one wrong step will get you incinerated, electrocuted, or bisected by gigantic hidden <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> blades.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Much later, when the cross-examination is over and the Heavensward is lifting off, bound for Nexus: "Okay, now that's done with- what's with these bags of dead beetles, Eikichi?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Yes! They were very nice."<br>

Some people look up and gasp, sure, but the streets are unusually empty, the crowds unusually thin, as you approach.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> appears to house a miles-high pillar of golden light.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy wakes up from a strange dream. He’s on his back, in the basement of the church in San Juan. The room is dark, as usual. Something’s changed. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oof." He opens his eyes, scans the darkened room, and picks himself up off the floor.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's up.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the dark place beneath the Columbia Building, Cav readies himself for a sort of proving. The great wide garden is empty. There are only five people besides him down here, and only four who have any official standing. The last is a guest. The four give him a wide berth. What will he attempt to do here, tonight? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The fifth, a Nosferatu baron, politely declines to be seen. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Before he goes, Tommy notices something. There’s several broad beams running across the length of the basement floor. Nobody ever bothered to cover it up…but he can see that someone has written something up on one of them, in the corner of the room. He’s not tall enough to just walk over and look clearly at it. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, he can get a chair.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nobody looks to doubt him. It’s not the kind of place where you dare to lie. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "My studies have been concentrated in the field of spontaneous phenomenal autodidactism.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He pauses. "Previous to this, my greatest success has been learning to use chopsticks."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Tommy pulls the chair up, he can see that something’s been carved into the wood. At first glance he can just see the first clumsy attempts, all gouged out with something dull. When he looks closer, he sees the three words have been carved over and over, in waves and spirals, all following the grain and whorls of the wood. The words repeat over and over, along the length of the beam. The words are: <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> YOU CAME BACK<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "If this goes well, you'll know it. If it doesn't go well, you'll also know that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Deep breath. "I'm going to begin."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy grabs his phone off the nightstand and begins taking pictures.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At first it doesn't look like Cav's doing much of anything, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that he's blinking almost too fast to track. Then his lips begin moving, mouthing words without making sounds, and his hands shudder as he reaches out and runs contorting, seizuring fingers up and down the neck of the guitar.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He climbs down off the chair and thumbs through his photograph roll, trying to puzzle it out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It becomes obvious what this is after a few moments: this is some strange form of Frenzy.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Suddenly he jacks knife once, twice, and falls off the stool.<br>

The performance appears, at first, to be painfully unskilled. But the others don’t move, even when he convulses and falls to the floor. It seems that this is in the realm of expected things for them. The Gangrel’s music begins to form together into something pleasant. The walls of the room seem smaller. As he gets to the second verse, the Nosferatu can smell <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> something. And hear something, behind the music. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav and Wilson are the only things not changing. The world seems to be going away. At one moment, they can smell the fragrances of the garden, and see the Ordo members sitting in the pavilion. The next, they’re alone. The sound remains. The garden begins to disappear. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> uh<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav is almost too tired to react.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They’re in a new place. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav and Wilson are on a broad tiled road. The tile continues on in front of them. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In front of them, the small road lies between two fields, each full with withered vermilion flowers. It ends at the beginning of the marble balustrades and facades of the pavilion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The white columns and walls of the main building reflect the bright light of an absent sun. The temple glitters, and from a distance Wilson can see the fine gold tracery in its eaves and edges. Its roof rises, in a thin column, into the pale red sky, until it disappears from sight.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Can Cavanaugh walk?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sure. Neither of them are injured. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yyeah.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Woah."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ sends Tommy the image of the business card, rather than OCR the address. She doesn't bother to repeat the thing about bringing money, even though she's grabbing a credit card and a few wads of cash out of a safe herself, because she assumes he hasn't got any.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At any rate, Tommy will be there at- well, roughly around the designated time. Plus or minus a few.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then he sees Wilson there, hands in his pockets, face carefully set. "I'm guessing this wasn't part of the show."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances, too, gets interrogated as to whehther something's up with traffic. KJ's kind of appalled that she's this far out of the loop of 'normal person' news.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson looks ahead, at the temple. "But where have we come, and where shall we end?" He starts walking forward.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav just follows him in silence, still looking around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The road leads to a short staircase.The steps are wide and flat. After twenty, they’re standing in the only room in the building.<br>

Whatever, the writing was on the wall there.. but it's funny, thinking about SF. This address KJ's on the way to, the card, the wink-wink-nudge-nudge nobody's supposed to know thing- it reminds her of the Latitude. Of the Bak-Ra.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No. There are four things and one person in here. On three marble plinths there are three figures reclined on their back, not moving and covered with white shrouds. On the fourth, there is a rotary telephone. Sitting in a chair aside all these things is Clinton Cavanaugh, or at least a perfect double of him. His eyes are closed, and he only sits and breathes. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...<br>

This is Frances' show to some extent, and hey, she could always run home. She speculates about what may be on Leiden Street until it's time to introduce- wait, will Yuan object to a Nosferatu? Maybe this was a bad idea.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The other baroness looks him over, and doesn’t seem too put off. “Hello.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The phone rings in the pavilion. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He does.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The loud noise seems to die down for a bit. “Cavanaugh.” It’s a voice only one of them has heard before. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The voice on the other end comes from the air. They can both hear it as if someone were in the room with them. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances shakes it. “I don’t think there will be any need for any rough-and-tumble stuff, you know?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Okay.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The voice on the other line: “How…am I talking to you?

They can see: a large room, quite unadorned, with cheap linoleum floors and bare white walls. In the center of the floor is about forty or so metal folding chairs. Half of them have occupants. They seem…a bit off. There’s a…man? With a grinning skeleton’s skull where his head should be. He nods politely. A woman with huge, rough stitches traveling up and down her neck and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> face, dressed in a nice business suit. A huge wolf, its head wreathed in mist and smoke, laying down to the side of the chairs. A man that seems to be a large number of rats in a jacket. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The shroud comes off the body. Wilson and Cav look down at Wilson Frost, before his disfigurement. His eyes look up sightlessly at nothing. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The skull-guy makes a clacking noise that might be laughter, and turns back, raising his hand. The faceless man’s last extended finger lowers. From the…well, somewhere, a man’s voice comes out through speakers. “The bidding on this item has ended.

They all seem to have their energies hugged close. Except the manager’s assistant at the front, who doesn’t make any effort at all to conceal hers. Her black aura seems to regularly shift to a lighter gray before darkening back, and both are shot through with a galaxy of sparkling, glittering shimmers. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cavanaugh in the chair moves.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav takes a few steps back. He's trying to keep his eyes on these...dolls? Mannequins? While he looks for a way out.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances: “No - well, I’ve never been here. I don’t really know what they have.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The disemodied voice sounds again. “Welcome to the new arrivals. Our next item is the collected journals of the mage known professionally as Phocas. The bid will begin at a small portion of your love for yourself.” A small murmur runs through the audience. They seem to be slightly embarrassed. The faceless man raises a hand, and a card table with some leather-bound books seems to slowly materialize on the cleared stage. His <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> hands raise, and the fingers are all extended. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The roar of the fans seems to rise once more. Cavanaugh in the chair turns his head from side to side. Cav can see his eyes more clearly now - small dark irises in enormous yellow pupils. They are blazing blanknesses. He can feel things from them. Rage. Insanity. The smell of blood is very strong here. Cavanaugh’s eyes seem to glitter in the dim light of the red sun. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The bedding at the Scarlet Palace would really be living up to the place's name if it wasn't for the diligent and concerted efforts of Eikichi and Ying at changing dressings, applying medicinal herbs, and generally displaying good bedside manner.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, for her part, has fallen asleep next to a book or journal she had been drawing in most of the night, which is presumably helping in some way.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As is, the room you've sequestered the sleeping "Swan" in is basically clean and livable, and you might even be safe to leave the man alone for the rest of the night. That means the Circle is free to discuss their next moves, or advance time to the following morning such that their guest has hopefully woken up, or whatever else. What's the plan?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's probably going to end up sleeping in shifts with Ying, and taking first shift by falling asleep at Swan's bedside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's... going to have to be fine! Ying will busy herself sketching ideas for an outfit, making sure to keep her notepad well-hidden when it comes time to switch with Eikichi. Hopefully Swan rests easy until then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's been hanging out in the common romm, and keeping an eye on the door.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Someone's bound to come looking sooner or later.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a good instinct, but one that isn't necessary yet. The night passes without incident, what with the hotel being empty aside from your circle, your guest, and a few employees, and the following morning the staff are ready with breakfast and other amenities.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will be snoring on a divan near the door until sun up, and then as soon as the Sun starts clearing the eastern horizon, she'll be up and poking around the kitchen to help with breakfast.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's probably going to be asleep until someone prods him, or lunch, whichever comes first.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Blossom wakes, she'll help Ying keep an eye on their guest.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan first stirs a little ahead of noon. He's in a bad way - no arm, right side of face, torso, and right leg grotesquely mangled. Thankfully, he's still got use of his right eye and seems to be able to hear out of his right ear, though not as well. All the injured(?) tissue is still liable to bleed, ooze, and agonize, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan mutters in what you think is the seatongue in his sleep, though I'm not sure if any of you speak it. Eventually, he groans and wakes. "What... what day...?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir helps get breakfast prepared and served, and ferries food up from the kitchen to their patient's ersatz room. She's pretty unperturbed by the extent of the injuries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You see a lot of shit up North.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What day is it, anyhow?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying hurries to wake Eikichi when Swan begins to stir; she's spent half of the morning organizing their supplies, ensuring they have plenty of balms, bandages, etc. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After Ying wakes Eikichi, they work together to ease his pain and keep him stable. The sorcerer spends some time prodding and studying the wounds. "Remarkable..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I'll say it's Moonday, the second day of Resplendent Water unless I remember it should be different.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Hm?" She didn't notice anything particularly unusual... bad burns, but nothing remarkable.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Moonday, second day of Resplendent Water," says Ir, delivering a soup.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You. Uh. Need help with it?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Whoa, you say it Moonday? Not Moon's Day?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "His injuries. Look for the contusions, the burns, the signs of any contingent physical trauma."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "There aren't any."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan's strong enough to take and drink from the cup, though there's a moment when it shakes in his hand and you begin to intensely regret letting him try. "...thank you. Uggh..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...thank you. Uggh..." <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir shrugs. "Not sure there's so much difference. Whoa there." Ir's nimble enough to catch the cup.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Come quickly, nurse, patient's trapped in the narration<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's the use of feeling, blue?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi goes on: "These injuries, it's like someone just scrambled him up. Like he was a piece of the Wyld corroded by a raksha."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Effective."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Unusual."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Have you heard of something like this before?" Ying hasn't, but Tatsuya's knowledge of medical history is woefully lacking.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "My dude, if you came from where I think you came from, you're a long way from touch-down."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Not really. I could see it happening in theory, but I've never heard of it happening this way."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Swan: "You're in the Scarlet Palace, a hotel at the end of the Grand Canal. You crawled out of the Canal last night. We took you in."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's a name?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You haven't heard anything from the street, but then, you haven't gone looking either.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I can find out," Blossom offers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "We're going to go check that right now."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "I'd ask you to tell Arianna I'm alive... I'm just not sure how you'd find her. Probably gone to ground."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Someone's got to look for Panther, someone's got to find out what the Council's proclaiming, someone's got to get in touch with the rest of his friends."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "And someone should stay here with him, in case people come looking."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Arianna of Rylea? You're with her? She's one of us?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He shuts his eyes for a moment. "She's one of us... a Twilight caste. From the river province. Tall, with silver hair, deep blue eyes..." It's fairly clear after the next minute or so that Swan himself isn't really sure what the magic you intend to use requires, and is extremely taken with her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Aww.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That said, a title like 'Arianna of Rylea' and the knowledge that she's a sorceress in the area should be enough to make sure your Messenger doesn't infallibly deliver your words to someone else.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's a little disappointed that Blossom's the one making the call here. Oh well, there'll be some other opportunity to meet her.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "I'll stay here with Swan. See if I can't help a bit while you guys are gone. If there's three things that need doing, that is."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan, to Ir: "I don't know. Depends on what they know. It's - this is what happened."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It takes a second, but soon a six-winged miniseraph is speeding away, carrying a message that introduces Excessively Righteous Blossom, and states that Swan is alive but badly injured, being cared for at the Scarlet Palace.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "We've been... we've long wanted to end the slave trade in Nexus. Among other things. The Guild doesn't like that, obviously."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Uh oh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She glances at Ying. Might be time to get Tatsuya out of his semi-retirement. To what degree is this place Guild-owned?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "I had plans... but Panther had enough, after a while, couldn't stand waiting any longer.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "The upshot is, I may be guilty of nothing more than obstructing the Council's justice... and already have served my sentence. But I can't be sure."<br>

It's vaguely serpentine, but is only visible by virtue of stuff getting sucked into it in order to define its volume - you can see it because of the steam of a nearby kettle, and ashes drawn in from the fireplace in the side of the room, and so on.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Should've seen that one coming."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wellllllll<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Enslaving someone is outlawed in Nexus. You just can't do it. You can, however, bring pre-existing slaves into Nexus, take those slaves back out of Nexus, put those slaves to work in Nexus, sell those slaves to other denizens of Nexus, etcetera.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If your slave, in Nexus, does get away, then fair's fair - they beat you and you can't just re-enslave them, as that is illegal. But simply entering Nexus does not render a slave free, and, in practice, even the escape clause (heh) is a moot point because what people do is have their slaves sign contracts of indentured servitude right before going through the gates.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah, contracts.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A contract is a contract, after all. To what extent Swan and his people have been opposing this isn't immediately clear, although you're free to ask for the nitty-gritty details.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a real fun thing Ir learned about contracts, back in Pneuma, when she got screwed out of wages for playing at this one tavern.<br>

She's looking for some place that stores past decisions by the Council and Emissary, ideally with scholarly commentary. There must be one- Nexus' highest laws are simple, and when a law is simple that means most of it is unwritten.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They need to know what the actual rules are, so they know when they're skirting and when they're breaking.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah, the arena. The arena, I assume, since Nexus has a few fighting grounds of varying repute littered around but only one actually suited to a gladiator of Panther's stature. It's a great cylinder of crenelated stone with roads radiating out in all directions, and even as they approach Eikichi and Ir can hear the roar of the crowd over even the comparably raucous roar of the Nexus <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> streets.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Badass.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are relief carvings all around and across the outer walls of the colosseum depicting warriors and beasts in various stages of combat and death; the grounds immediately around it are swarming with ticket scalpers, food carts, and souvenir sellers. In fact, on their approach, Eikichi and Ir have repeated opportunities to buy little portraits and toys depicting Panther himself.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's heart leaps into his throat. He loved coming here when he and Tatsuya were working out of Nexus full-time, but now he's cagey. The orbs slide up one of his sleeves and they're gone. "Yeah."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "...you want first?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Let's try being quiet if we can."<br>

Well, Nexus's "government" bureaucracy. Nexus, of course, is run by the Council of Entities, a group of variously mortal and variously explicable figures who collectively set public policy. It's not immediately clear how one actually gets onto the Council or if there's any mechanism to kick them out, although <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> one supposes that'll be found in some book somewhere.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Where do business inquiries go?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Council's offices are in the center of the city - just a few blocks from the big arena, actually - and are a blocky white First Age building topped with a shining, mirrored dome and surrounded by auxiliary structures of very high-quality mortal make, incorporating lots of granite and marble in an attempt to blend in with the Hollow architecture they surround.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom finds that anyone is free to peruse the Incunabulum... for a modest fee, of course. One paid by the hour, although you can buy time in bulk at a slightly cheaper rate. There are helpful signs - it seems that a full week of eight-hour days is best value!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom wants a working knowledge of the current and most common civilities and, what, enough of a grasp of the Emissary's past actions that she can predict what his next steps are likely to be w/r/t blowing Panther and Swan the fuck up?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Right.<br>

There's a small galaxy of enterprises that comprises the Nexus Arena, and enterprises that serve those enterprises, and so on, and so forth. The formal owners, the owners and/or agents of various fighters, the architects, the cleaners, the merchandisers, the advertisers... you don't need to travel more than a <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> block to find at least a representative of any of these concens.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Well... I'm not gonna promise anything, but we've been known to work miracles. Medical included." She pulls up a chair to the side of the bed. "There's five of us, actually. You've seen me, Ir, Eikichi, and Blossom, there's Tatsuya, and... we used to have Bergsveinn. Miss that guy." She never actually met him, but Tatsuya misses him, which is good enough for her.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She turns away. "He said he had to go north."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not a great line of work.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will tolerate his bullshit, and watch the crowd.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan nods slowly. "I know how it is. It's hard to keep a Circle together... so much pulls on everyone's attention at once. So many old scores or old promises are suddenly within reach. Dace, Jade... they're both out of town, and maybe if they hadn't been this wouldn't have happened."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "You four been at this long?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So Eikichi and Ir are formally going to wait for the day's fighting to finish so that they can try to get hold of some example of the talent, but also, low-key, figure out how one gets into the show?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Do we have enough time to check the attack site before the fights let out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Five," she corrects automatically. "Half a year, I think. Little more, maybe? I came in later, but the others... it's been a journey."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "How about your Circle? This must not have been the first scrape y'all ran into."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If we do, Ir's more than amenable to hanging over. Better than hanging out at the meat market.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, there's a lot of fights - it looks like they're scheduled long into the evening for today. Right now it just sounds like some poor bastards are getting mowed down by a manticore, so if Ir and Eikichi head off on some other errand it shouldn't prevent them from being back in time to hound down some actual popular gladiators.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "It's been maybe a year since we got together for the first time. I think Panther might've been Chosen for two or three by now... less for me and the others. But we've been up and down the River Province."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Time to scope the crime scene, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's what an ex called it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You know, where a guy got dead.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "Fought our way in, and back out of, the Nameless Lair... dug Dace's old Daiklave up out of a tomb in this very city... guess our biggest concern has been Thorns."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One wonders how much evidence'll be left there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "I think a lot of the slaves that move through Nexus wind up there. Not that that's the main reason for our concern. ...most of our concern."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's up when they reach the place where it all went down?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Having marked the time that the biggest-name match today will be ending, and figured out who they need to talk to if they want to enter someone into the games (or enter themselves), Ir and Eikichi move on through the city to the scene of the crime, as it were. It's not hard to remember where it was, since you got a bird's eye view on your approach, and you know you're going the right <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> direction when you start running into unusually large numbers of street cleaners, masons, painters, etc.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Actually investigating the Emissary's handiwork is a longstanding Nexus taboo, so Eikichi and Ir don't actually have to worry about too much competition when it comes to scouring the scene. They will have to worry about the effects of repair and foot traffic, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Seen from on foot, the area in question seems to be - to have been - a market square. Wide, joined by multiple avenues, surrounded by banks and storefronts and food shops. Lots of bustling stalls, and a wide area in the middle that's currently basically empty but which probably held more stalls or maybe platforms or a big tent or something like that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Time to start looking around.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ravages of magical combat are still visible along what's left of the cobblestones and in the various burn marks, craters, and cracks running through the facades all around the market square, of course. At a glance, it's clear that immense force and elemental power of various kinds was loosed here... followed by, obviously, a great tide of soot and gore.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They managed to scrub that latter bit out yet?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's probably not gonna be a proper blood trail, but...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does anything look scrambled like Swan was?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "We were up in Crystal, mostly. Some other things, too, but... I'll see if 'Kichi has a copy of the book to spare, if you're interested." She grabs her sketchbook and starts working away. "What was it about Thorns, if not the slaves?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Quite probably something does. Ir and Eikichi will have to look around...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sounds like we'll do just that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "Everything about Thorns, really. It's ruled by a psychotic monster, and there's no indication he'll stop at one city. Every slave sent that way is at least one soldier that'll one day march against us - maybe three, if Arianna's right."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "The Confederation needs to act as one to, to blast the Mask from Creation's face... but as of right now, it can barely be persuaded to stop sending him fodder."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe three? Does this clown know anything.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *in minor, ominous voice* One, two, a three four five, everybody in the square so come on let's ride<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, it's hard to tell if the preacher lived through his meeting with the hand of...trade interdiction. Someone was left standing, Ir can tell; and people are more than willing to affirm that it wasn't just the Emissary. But then he told them to start walking, and they did. So it gets confusing after that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At least there's something all the merchants and passers-by are willing to agree on: clean up crew was Council's own. The privy boys. So if there's a body, either it dragged itself out, or those fuckers carried it out under tarps.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying, more lighthearted than she feels: "Oh, three is right, if that's his aim. I guess we'll be talking about that when the rest of my Circle gets back." 'My' Circle, huh? That feels... good. "Gosh! Everything's happening all the time, there's just so much to do."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's around that time that Blossom gets back, knocking quietly on the doorframe before entering. "Everything all right in here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One thing's for sure: the Guild's loud and proud angry. Good. Fuck 'em. Makes them easier to find, and easier to negotiate with.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everything's a negotiation, right? Even this.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Hey, Blossom!" Ying's chipper as usual. "Swan and I were just trading stories. Talkin' about stuff around Nexus. Thorns, too."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This bloody square.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Negotiations will be fun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Thorns? Why?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi doesn't talk to anyone, looking like an overgrown but extremely pretty child in his pajamas, scraping his feet over cobblestones and periodically sitting on the ground as if tired while studying the blast marks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir talks to everyone. Better they're chatting with her while they're distracted by him. Oh, those pajama bottoms. If they only had a door. Get over yourselves, women. And men.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "They're a big buyer in slaves, apparently. Might be makin' themselves an army? Swan's Circle's been workin' that beat, 'til. You know." <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Otherwise, she'll be mainly circumspect but curious, like she's trying to find a business angle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> These shitheads will eat that up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "That's low, even for the Guild."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> By the time they're done, Ir's convinced the next stage of things is as follows: they've got to come up with a venture, and express an interest in working with the Guild.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And through the Guild, then, they've got to access the Council.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And maybe that venture's about bodies. Using their connect in Sijan.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan nods. "That's what I thought. Then I came around. I think it's business as usual for the Guild."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Swan: "I'm not sure if they think they can curry favor with the Mask or just... can't think ahead, institutionally. But it's perfectly normal for them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi gets a couple people tossing him coins as he sits at the side of the square, and he has to wave off one or two people offering to shelter him, but a while later he pops up and walks over to Ir like he'd been sitting around waiting for her. "Alright, ready to go?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Been ready. You?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Idiot.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Two kingdoms in the River Province were on the verge of war for the possession of an embankment. And Excessively Righteous Blossom, seeing the kings and their armies ready to fight, asked to hear the cause of their quarrels.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Having heard both sides, she said: "I understand that the embankment has value for some of your people; has it any inherent value aside from its usefulness?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They said: "It is sure that many will be slain and our own lives endangered."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "No," the kings said, "The lives of people and above all the lives of kings, are priceless."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The wrath of the two monarchs subsided, and they came to a peaceable agreement.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Excessively Righteous Blossom met several demons while on a long voyage. And though the demons were strange and frightening, she loved them all the same, and saw they were badly mistreated by their master. So she sought out their master, a powerful sorcerer with an indolent heart.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She asked: "Why do you treat your demons so poorly? They are graceful and well-mannered, and bring no one any harm."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sorcerer would have ignored her, but they were entranced by her beauty and the shock of the question.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sorcerer replied: "Because I have bound them, and have dominion over them. They are my inferiors and respect is wasted on them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom said: "What of a peasant farmer? She is less powerful than you are. Should you treat her so badly as well?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "No," the sorcerer said, "for a peasant is still human, and all men and women are my brothers and sisters."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "But you have dominion over them," said Blossom, for she was insistent. "They are your inferiors just as the demons are."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sorcerer was angry. "No!" they said. "I am no better than the barest or weakest among us."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then Blossom said: "Do you not live as a laughing prince among them? Do you not bask in their regard?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom pinched the sorcerer's face. "Fool! Hypocrite that you are, for the truth is plain and you ignore it!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With a stinging cheek, the sorcerer acknowledged her wisdom. "Forgive me!"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Frances and KJ probably didn’t notice when Tommy kind of slumped over and stopped moving. He’s not the talkative type, after all - what’s one more night of not speaking up?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They probably noticed when his chair started to scoot across the floor with an awful metallic scraping noise, though, since everyone started to look. So KJ might have seen the glazed over look in his eyes. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They definitely noticed when his chair suddenly flung itself sideways, and he sprawled on the floor…next to Cav and Wilson?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hooboy.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Some chairs go skidding out of the way when they crash onto the floor. A soft red spotlight descends on them from the ceiling. The Auctioneer taps his throat, and quickly mentions that sales will resume in a moment, please bear with us as we sort things out. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Tommy Saldana wakes up on his back.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson snorts.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Anyway, there's one episode where they get really, really small, and go inside the human body."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Wilson and I just did that, but with my soul."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are we out of the big room now or are we having this conversation in front of all the weirdos?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ can see the woman’s aura pretty easily. In the excitement, she hasn’t bothered to do much to hide it. Valentine can see swirling patterns of red and brown shift slowly into a light blue…all the colors are emphasized by bursting and tiny constellations of sparkles. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All the not-us weirdos.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav won't start in on the PBS explainers until they're clear and it's just them and Trubee.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I knew I should've stayed home today.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Well the good news is, you weren't with us. But that leaves a whole lot of other places you could have been."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's not how auras work. What the hell kind of emotion is 'starbursts and swirling'?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In front of all the weirdos. “Hang on,” says Trubee, bending over the new arrivals. She fastens plastic wristbands, the kind you see at carnivals and music shows, to their wrists, and the red spotlight goes away. Then, after having pulled Tommy to his feet, she leads them over to the side of the room, in front of a door that reads EMPLOYEES ONLY. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;tom&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Thanks,"  is about all the nosferatu can muster.<br>

She takes out a key and puts it into the door’s lock, turning it. The light goes green, and then she pulls it open and motions for them to go through. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hopefully she actually works here and didn't lift that key off somebody.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ultimately, in the Brilliant Court you learn to kind of go with it. KJ's not going to bother remaining hidden since Frances and the others are clearly being.. collected.. for some purpose that likely includes her anyway. There's too many of them to actually be in danger, except from their own Beasts snarling.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How many of us even have audible Beasts? Like, two? One of whom is Ma's kid?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ, appearing as she passes through the doorway: "This should be more surprising."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Magic."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav rolls his eyes.<br>

A good half-mile off, they can see the beach and ocean. It’s very quiet out here. The only sound is crickets and waves. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They’ve just come out of what looks like an enormous and run-down RV.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan finds herself blinded by the morning sun, the ground heat-baked already, the shadowland a mirage behind her.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She makes it over hardpan and past ancient dried lakebeds, and through mile after mile of featureless red desert. She finds the strength to stay on her feet, her will refusing to let her "ssSSSSSSSS" a snake emerges from the brush, mottled black and tan! It lunges at Xia Lan!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She stumbles back, lashing out with her hook sword as she dodges away from the snake. Something about facing death makes you less likely to shriek in terror and fall over yourself to get away from a single, puny snake.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Her blow strikes home! Xia Lan hears the serpent scrape hideously against her hook sword, but it can't cut through. Instead, the serpent winds against the blade, sliding along it as if it were smooth as a tree branch. She has no hope of avoiding the bite.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh no.<br>

Her chest burns -- every breath comes in like fire. She collapses, on her hands and knees in the desert, as the snake winds itself free.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The serpent cuts a path through the dusty ground into the brush. Xia watches it insinuate itself into the branches of a barren brown bush. Xia and the bush alike cast no shadow. The sun is directly overhead.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia sees the bush ignite, red and gold and white, a flame that pillars high into the sky but doesn't spread through the underbrush. It's then that Xia hears a voice. A voice that comes from everywhere. A voice that calls her name.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan.<br>

This has to be some dream her body's cooked up to make her last moments less miserable. She waves an arm towards the desert expanse, dropping it back down at her side; Not lost? Not defeated? Not alone? "I'm already dead. Save somebody else."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I will not save you.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bamaz scoffs. "I told you. I owe a man a favor.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan: "Okay, I'll bite. What favor do you owe him? I've never had... dealings, like this."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bamaz: "He paid for my freedom."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan: "..."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bamaz has put his pipe out, but his nostrils are streaming smoke all the same. "Come and shake a poor sinner's hand."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan: "I never gave you my name." She reaches a hand out regardless, grinning. "The Unfettered Xia Lan, daughter of the Sun. Historian, bargainer of devils, and singer - come see me before I head to Nexus. I'll get you some VIP seats."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Xia Lan takes Bamaz's hand, and the smoke seems to envelop them. There's no sign of Bamaz's bookshop anymore, or sounds from the streets outside. There's no sign of Bamaz either, come to think of it, save the swirling smoke, the glint of his eyes like coals in the dark, and the hot steady pressure of his hand on hers. The pressure builds on her like the heat of a day in Zoatham.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And then the smoke evaporates, the pressure breaks, and Xia Lan is alone, in an empty storefront in an abandoned building. She's standing over an ash-streaked counter in front of a pane of glass that catches the glare from the lanterns outside like a mirror. She needs to hold it up to see the music.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She reads it eagerly, wishing to internalize that which she bargained for. To learn this, to perform this - that she'll have to make her way to Nexus afterwards seems secondary.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's got a lot of verses and sort of a marching beat. It's a simple song; the sort you lead people in instead of performing at recital. Xia can read the entire thing if she looks closely, but the last verse is the least faded:<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So the world shall be his footstool, and the soul of wrong his slave<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Our God is marching on<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the back of the frame is a note with a name and an address:<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The address is a bookshop in the Firewander district. The name is "Vladok".<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She hums the song to herself quietly in the abandoned shop. Mouthing the words, guessing at the ones that are completely lost - she'll have to retranslate it, perhaps... She doesn't even think to question whether it was worth it as she strides out of what used to be Bamaz the Bookbinder's shop, on her way to arrange passage to Nexus. A debt must be repaid, after all.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At the San Juan Capistrano station, the late hour has cleared out most visitors to the old city’s historic downtown. The last tourists are headed home as you get there, pulling jackets on as the temperature dips below 65. The station itself is little more than a low brick structure and more brick arches next to a long platform of pink cobblestone. Palm trees line the little lane, and the train, starting with the massive block <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (Everyone stays healthier that way.)<br>

No one on either side has ever attacked a train. Some things are more useful as neutral ground. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav glances at the woman with a raised eyebrow before turning to KJ. Rush and Buchanon are probably standing off a bit, talking amongst themselves or on the phone. If either of those two has significant others or family they want to bring, Cav will have bought tickets through the office for them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Zelda, this is the Baron of Laguna Beach, Shepherd of Crook and Cross, protector-emeritus of the Orange Territory that was. Cav, Zelda Essos."<br>

We're leaving responsibilities behind, which is the same as shirking them." KJ thinks of the email sitting behind a screensaver in her secure room, unsent.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Oh, we don't leave anything behind. Not anymore. That's not the kind of job this is."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He sighs. "Hopefully the neighborhood won't explode while we're out."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Do you know anything fun to do in San Diego?" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ghoul Essos fades into the foreground. While she's standing still it's hard to pick her out from the potted plants that line the inner wall of the old station.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "I always wanted to catch a baseball game at PetCo Park, but I think that possibility's been rather firmly removed from the list of options."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the three barons’ staffs mingle, waiting for the conductor to call all aboard, KJ sees someone through the window of a nearby cafe, sitting on a bench inside, waiting. Presbyter Vincent technically administers this territory for the Church, but her offices aren’t in San Juan Capistrano. Is she waiting for someone? Or taking a train? Either way, she’s taken pains to not be seen on the platform. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "San Diego's not really a nightlife city."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "From my understanding, at least."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "For a couple of weeks, it will be. If you're as good as I am." Or if Wilson is, but that seems unlikely.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “All aboard!” They can hear the sudden whuff of the engines cycling up, and their few fellow passengers start lining up and stepping in. As they do, every ghoul’s phone buzzes with an email notification. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She doesn't draw any attention to the priest, but makes sure to stand somewhere where Clara Vincent can see her - deliberately enough that a watcher watching themselves watched will be aware of the watched's watch. It's arguably a form of respect.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Clarabelle waves when she sees KJ seeing her. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Rush and Buchanan both dutifully forward it to Cav; it’s from the Seneschal. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav follows KJ's eye line back to the Presbyter, and when she waves, Cav will nod in her direction and smile. To KJ, without looking away from Vincent: "Ah. The church will be joining us after all."<br>

In New York no one would have known about something like this until after the Prince had returned. But then, the climate in New York is much different than it is in Los Angeles.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For instance, his last update on New York politics was Holymount's psuedo-sad notification that the other senior partners had been murdered while travelling.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With their belongings secured, the train blows its whistle and pulls out of the station. Within a few minutes, they’re clear of San Juan Capistrano and on the coastal track, the ocean on their right and the pitch-black foothills to their left. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ doesn't comment directly. "Have they got us sharing cabins? I'm in.. how do you read this thing.."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Seat BOF1. Or that might be the ticket number, and the seat number is something else. TBM?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There’s hardly anyone else on the train with them at this time of night.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Amtrak that Cav is used to has general, self-selected seating with a quiet car in the front. But it depends if their benefactors have sprung for first class or not.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They have not. The quiet car is off-limits to coach passengers, sadly. There’s a website where they can use the Amtrak app to upgrade on the spot, but if you try to go on their website to download it, their servers appear to be down. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Annoying.<br>

Anyway. An empty train is a much safer place to say: "'Abroad' could totally mean San Diego. Or this could be a distraction from that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The train softly trundles down the coast track. They can see the San Clemente Pier now, the track running just behind the public beach. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not because of foreign invaders, mind. But because it's doubtful the secret police will be joining them on this excursion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Just more room for Burne and/or Bren to operate without supervision.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "It'll be fine.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The two massive, concrete domes of the San Onofre nuclear station appear out of the darkness, silhouetted against the water.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "That sounds like...the opposite of fine."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Didn't you go through a special training program to be the center of attention?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ leans back and squints.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ doesn't know whether to expect people who speak mostly Spanish or refuse it entirely.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> His impulse to roll his eyes at KJ scampering and shouldering up next to him is immediately replaced with a flash of startlement, then slight embarrassment.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Briefly and nonsensically, he worries if this is some kind of Masquerade violation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Baron Valentine nods to the mariachi, takes the flowers and sticks the brightest in her suit pocket. She's gladhanding and blowing kisses like they've got a red carpet, which perhaps they literally do<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They can both see Ambassador Gannon shoo away a courtier holding a pair of white porcelain masks on a satin pillow. “Not here,” she says, exasperated. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> None of this shows on his face, which breaks out in an easy smile as he moves forward to meet and greet the San Diego delegation. If the vampires here are speaking Spanish, he will too.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Lo siento mucho, pero mi español es malo. We're very happy to be wherever we are."<br>

The last time KJ saw her, she was ready to club. Now, she’s dressed in a long black skirt, with a white and blue rebozo wrapped around her shoulders, a huge blue flower in her hair. “Welcome, Barons! So good to see you. I hope your travels weren’t too stressful.” Her deep southern accent feels a bit out of place here, but her friendly demeanor goes a long way to explain why she was <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> picked for the position. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There isn’t a San Diego delegation, actually. As they get their bearings, they realize it’s just the ambassador and a few assistants. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It was peaceful as all get-out, Ambassador!

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby waves KJ off. “Oh, no, don’t worry about all that yet. I’ll make sure you’re settled in at the table before I put anything on your plate. Where are you all staying?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav will have booked a nice but not extravagant set of rooms at one of the best hotels in the city. Three in total, one for him and each of his ghouls.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh right, nevermind.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They already made arrangements.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "That I was."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby’s smile remains on through effort. “Oh, you’re staying with the Princess La Jolla after all? Well. Okay.” Somehow, colorful serapes have been put on the arrivals’ shoulders in the meantime. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav notes the effort.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "It's hard to turn down hospitality like that. How's the city been, Abby?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Is there anything we should be aware of on that front?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Ambassador shakes her head. “No, nevermind, I’m just being a party pooper. Better you three safe and sound with the Princess than me having to worry about you all the time. Anyway…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Oh, it’s wonderful! You know, KJ, you would hate it in the long-term, but I’ve fallen in love. Feels like a small town, with all the big city amenities. Just don’t tell them I said that,” she says, winking. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “On which front, Baron?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The amenities have great pitch," KJ notes. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hard to tell precisely what the ambassador's problem with the princess is. 'Good' news is that usually when someone is uneasy but polite about a landed elder he hasn't met, the matter clears itself up very quickly, because the elder walks around in full plate mail or advocates for burning the forests down to drive the witches into the sea.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Work for a pittance, too.

Once you’re all settled in and you’ve spent a night or two relaxing, come see me and I’ll get you up to speed. The signing gala isn’t for another three days, anyway.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "We're here as your resources, Abby. We'll be holidaying as long as you don't need us- but if you do, don't hesitate. Please!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Just a few recommendations before you go, though. Please, please stick together while you’re out. Things are better than they were, feelings-wise. But they’re not totally peachy keen on us, you know? Especially - and KJ, you know I don’t mean this about you and yours, or yours, Baron, obviously - especially when you’re being a royal asshole.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I’ve had to send some people home. How they got down here, I can’t imagine.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Can I ask you one thing, though? As the Ambassador to San Diego."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Thank you, Baron.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Well, the Court chose to send Barons who - between us - accounted for at least fifteen dead on the other side.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby waves a hand. “Oh, that. No, don’t worry about it. Honestly, it’s the whole San Diego thing, you know. You’re doing them a favor, really, dying in glorious battle, you know. They won’t say it, but some of these elders like portraits of dead children more than the living thing. As long as you did it wearing armor, face to face, I can’t imagine they’ll try anything. Now, they might give you a nasty look or two. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But all’s fair in love and war, etcetera…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Haha. Yeah. Wearing armor.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, it was face-to-face at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claw-to-face.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby: “Now, I was in San Francisco at the time, so I guess the principle only goes so far - oh, well, I’m sure the Princess has a spare driver for you. If you want to stretch your legs on your own, we’ve got our own exclusive cab contract. I’ll send you the number. Service all hours, anywhere in the county. Tip well, though. They drive faster that way. The trolleys are cute little things, but it’s only around downtown.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Plus, you know what a pain in the ass sticking to a schedule is, especially when you just want to relax.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> True to Abby’s prediction, they can see a fully-uniformed chaffeur, brass buttons running down the front of his jacket, waiting at a respectful distance for them. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let's grab a spare serape for him.<br>

You're looking for one of the higher blocks of the southwestern undercity - a tightly-packed tenement built into the side of a cavern and all along the shelf of stone jutting out from it. It's fed by rivulets of water branching off from the Grey River and lit <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's swishing a stick around, polished wood painted black with the balance and gentle arc of a slashing sword. Still wearing the cape, obviously.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a winding slope that leads up to the neighborhood, which you learn from the signage and the mutterings of locals is called the High Hollow. The naming's a bit ironic, given that Hollow is the proper name of the First Age city on whose ruins Nexus is built - these people probably just referred to the fact that the neighborhood's piled into a cavern that's been cut out of the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> bedrock by some force or other. It's a little unusual for the Undercity, most of which is built on old sewer infrastructure rather than natural stone.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hollow was kind of a weird name for a city in the first place. You gotta wonder what they were thinking.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At any rate, it's quite crowded - not because there are a lot of people there, but because the wood buildings there are tightly clustered and leave very little room for passers by. It's basically unavoidable that you have to jostle, although the people here are tightly cloaked and generally keep their eyes to the ground.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Do the Notaries announce themselves and demand information or slip stealthily about or what?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, with your demeanors, people are quick to avoid you. Doors close, figures take turns down alleyways rather than pass by, and such.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Probably a lot of thieves and ne'er-do-wells here. It's good that they avoid us.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend drags his wooden sword across the gap-toothed panels of the undercity shacks like a child hitting fenceposts with a stick. At some point, someone sticks their head out of a door to find out who's making that racket, and comes face to face with a tall man in a tall hat, hiding behind a white mask and a billowing cape. "Friend!" He extends his free right hand. "I'm Friend. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah. Friend says the magic words: "We've already been paid. We really are just here to help."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If this guy doesn't have anything to say, there's a lot more houses to hit with sticks. Friend keeps at it until somebody talks.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend: "?"<br>

And he's paid, he'll tell you. Once he's assured that this isn't the leadup to some kind of really strange intimidation tactic, though, he lets slip a few things - like that the neighbor across from his resonance took ill a few days back and hasn't been seen since, and that the one place to eat in the entire neighborhood has <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> closed for unspecified reasons, and that there've been more bodies floating down the channels out of the neighborhood than usual.<br>

You've got a small list of apartments and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> hidey-holes to check, as well as directions to the mushroom stir-fry spot itself.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There was this gelato shop in Pneuma--<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's not all - of these three people, two look unwell. Pale, sweaty, with the vitreous humor in their eyes far greener than it should be.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dexys: "Whispers? Was not aware they had territory." She quirks her head slightly. "Change in business?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend gives them a dazzling smile, hands up in a gesture of peace. "My friends, we're not here to make your lives harder. Holed up here... fighting for your lives... getting sicker by the day... you don't need to suffer like this. You are not alone."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Man: "Y-... they sent you?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> First man: "Shut up!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend rights a stool from the outer barricade and sits on it.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The three are put at ease.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They explain: they were watching a shipment when something went wrong. They sent word for help but haven't heard back.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Invincible Scholar Princess: "What went wrong?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dexys examines one of the two sick ones, but comes up with nothing useful. Do they complain of any symptons beyond looking very ill?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Intense staring and occasional prodding allows Star to extract an entire accounting from these men. They're working for the 'Whispers', a duct gang (it's like a street gang, but this is the undercity) that deals in secrets and occult goods and has become increasingly militant and organized in recent months. Specifically they were transporting what they were told were artifacts and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> persishable alchemical reagants from elsewhere in the city.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> These things were sealed in boxes of mahogany inlaid with gold and were expressly meant to never be opened, exposed to heat, turned on their side or upside down, or even shaken particularly hard. As far as these guys know, those instructions were followed to the letter, so it came as a serious surprise when the secret storehouse kept in the basement of this restaurant just... exploded. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bloomed, one might say.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It melted a few people and started growing rapidly and these goons did their best to seal it up. Now, as they said, they're waiting for support - they sent out the call by breaking a jade slip they were supposed to, but didn't hear back. Whoever was supposed to take care of this left them hanging, unless you're them, which it doesn't sound like.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star listens motionlessly and intently, then swivels their head to stare at Friend. "Purge the Kruthik, then?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend: "The kruthik have probably absorbed whatever was already in the basement.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star: "That should get the attention of whomever has been lax in answering their talent."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We should...talk."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Princess: "Can you cure those two?" She gestures at the two men with greenish ichor tainting them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And whoever else outside this building is infected... and any bodies that might've fallen in the waterways leading out of here... this might mean days of work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dexys remains silent and looks to Friend.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend: "Oh, yeah, definitely. Especially with Princess's help."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We'll need some slightly esoteric supplies, but I'm sure we can get those."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star: "We will need a clinic."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Well, nobody's going to be eating here for a while.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "True. But first things first." Star's head turns to consider the junk pile and the two men sitting on it again. "The Kruthik."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "True..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One of them: "What're- what're you gonna do about it? I don't even know what's down there."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dexys: "Best not to know."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Invincible Scholar Princess: "Cheer up! There won't be anything down there soon."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend, very seriously: "Do you really want to know?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He goggles at you. "J-just that you'll win."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She leans uncomfortably close to the one that asked. "Less known, less to confess to later. Something to think about."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend beams: "We always win."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They back away, one by one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend unhooks his sword from his belt, proffering it to the healthy Whisper. "Hold this for me, would you?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Uh..." He takes it, uncertain.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the way down: "I'll let you know, next time I meet an Immortal."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star slinks off the table and follows them down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a few minutes' work to shove the pile of clutter off of the trap door, which the three men won't help you do unless you make them. They find counters to hide behind as you open the thing up, causing a toxic green light to spill upwards out of the square hole in the floor and catch on the opposing ceiling.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nothing comes leaping up, but there is a plume of rising vapor. Only one of you's fitting through at a time - Friend's first?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That'd be foolish. But yes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So what's down there? "Is the vapor dangerous?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You probably don't want to breathe it without a cloth or something.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Spores."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star will go second.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Good thing Dexys Violetta is wearing a mask. She's third.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Princess will make an ersatz mask out of some cloth. It's fortunate that she doesn't need to breathe.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You slide down a ladder into a glowing, pulsing hell. This room might've been square once, and made of earth and stone. Now the floor and walls are all the same disquietingly organic mass, a tesselation of bones and shells and tendrils and membranes that never exactly repeats itself.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend had a red handkerchief in the pocket of his suit, he just ties it around his face before going down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star has both the shell mask and a cloth wrap on underneath it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star snaps and the spear-staff becomes a familiar whip-sword in their hand.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a screeching, chittering growl as a great scarab-like plate of chitin on the far wall quivers and then stretches forward, partially detaching itself from the surrounding tissue. It's like the head of a dragon - no, the head and forelegs of a dragon, now - that's sort of entombed within the wall but capable of stretching far enough to snarl and snap at you.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As it wakes, clumps of biomatter on either side of it quiver and swell, beginning to grow and pulsate into... something. Worse, at the same time, humanoid shapes rise from the floor, barely-coherent people made of equal parts swirling spores and regurgitated bone and organ.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a flash of light visible up the ladder, sunset purple. Below, Friend sweeps through the anima of cherry blossoms, hand on Zantetsuken's hilt.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star: "Burn it. Burn it all."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend weaves between the zombies like they're the awkward kids in a nightclub. He touches the brim of his hat to the head in the wall, there's a razor-thin flash of white-light, and a smoking wound opens in the creature's skin, only to heal just as fast.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Star leaps straight over top of them, pushing off the ceiling and lancing straight at the creature in the wall in a flurry of whip-steel. Two dozen blows land, each healing up as soon as they cut, but Star is in position to do so much more, now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Midnight's Darling, Dexys Violetta smashes the rising tide as they slough forward. Each kick disintigrates one of the horde, while another rises to take its place... it's hard to fight here! Everything just feels bad, and gross. She's going to have to spend ages washing this.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion_&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The tide of bodies surges up and in every direction -- but Last Westerly Star is already moving away.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The bodies are really easy to destroy. One solid hit pretty much causes them to explode and crumble. But as soon as you land, a new one just comes sprouting up from the floor before you, or behind you, or even beneath you! You think that there's an end to them... eventually...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Friend takes a step back from the monster in the wall, ending up directly in the middle of a pack of the mutants. There's a sigh like a breeze on the wind and five of them fall to the ground in ten pieces. A streamer of light is visible around Friend's shoulders trailing down to his waist for a moment, and steam rises from the seam between the hilt and scabbard at his belt.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Invincible Scholar Princess snaps her fingers and gestures floridly at the lurching fungus zombies, searing their flesh black and dropping them to the squirming floor, one after another.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The tide turns in some way as Blossom lets loose. The squirming creatures, presumably reverse-engineered from the two or three people caught in the initial fungal eruption, shrivel and wither in the torrent of blue flame. Fewer and fewer of them are growing back up from the floor, and the torrents of fungal spores released as they crack open are consumed by fire before they can set <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> adapted to living in and spreading through water. So, after a search of hours, Blossom comes across a sort of glowing cocoon growing out of the torso of a withered body that's washed up on the side of an abandoned sewer passageway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nothing stops her from carbonizing it entirely - or from following the easy-to-miss slime trails forking away from it and immolating some wriggling, wormlike things that were trying to build lairs of their own.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Invincible Scholar Princess lurks in the deeper shadows of the already-fairly-deeply shadowed High Hollow. Through turning up nigh-invisible scuff marks where a body was been dragged into the river, tiny splotches of blood and damp, and watching the stains showing high tide, she tracks down the corpse that got away. A few swift gouts of flame see to the cocoon and the larvae, and then <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> a brief touch on a withered forehead turns the corpse into fading motes of light.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi, Ir, and Tatsuya, still disguised as people with far more interesting names, have similar experiences back in the undercity shantytown. There's a lot of knocking on doors and interrogating locals and cross-referencing different stories, and, in a couple cases, simply following one's nose.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The three find a few people on the brink of death, shivering and withering in their own dwellings. The find corpses, too, shriveled and blackened wrecks with shelves of fungus growing out from between their ribs and quivering eggs in their abdominal cavities. At one point, Ir opens a door to a dead man's home and finds a wolf-sized kruthik pouncing straight at her, fangs and pincers <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> gleaming, and is forced to break its back and strangle it.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The better part of a day later, the whole business is done - High Hollow's free of "plague", and anyone with even an inkling of what that plague was or where it may have came from has been talked, sworn, or terrified into secrecy.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "Are we going to wait around and see if anyone shows to check up on the disaster this was supposed to be?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> An entire warehouse has, per Ying's specifications, been converted into a house of healing; burning medicinal herbs and burnished holy symbols deck the walls there, and the dozen-odd infected who remain huddle there and wait for the corruption within their bodies to subside. Fortunately, it's going well, and the rest of the neighborhood is really pulling together - having been <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> galvanized by Eikichi and given the chance to flex their collective muscles in rebuilding the place to start with, the rest of the residents are quick to bring tea, take care of kids, and otherwise assist in the community's convalescence.<br>

Important but not life-or-death urgent notices and requests will be found in a trapdoor hidden between and beneath some tree roots there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That being squared away, the Notaries are paid a substantial sum in jade and silver, exactly as agreed upon, and then dismissed.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Specifically, get good friends who can cast spells for you.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anything else going on? Maybe some clothing orders for Ying?<br>

Otherwise, the city ticks along - the steady stream of refugees from the east is driving down all sorts of wages, to the consternation of some and the pleasure of others, and the Guild seems to have taken down its public requests for help with its bizarre logistical <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> problems, and the announcement by a luminary of the Gymnasium of a miraculous formula for transforming worthless gold into priceless silver has turned out to be a fraud, and...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hey! Gold isn't worthless, it has a number of ornamental and alchemical uses!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So basically worthless.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All right, but it was funnier to say it the way I did.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For a little while now, banners, billboards, and pieces of street art throughout the city of Nexus have been cryptically prophetic - They're coming! or Beware...! or similar.

We'll need Ir in her full battle regalia, they're told, and ready to at least do a cool jump or something as the great match is made fully public.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Perfect. They'll be ready.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The grand announcement is being made at the huge plaza directly behind Nexus's own gates, between the Firewander and Bastion districts. The high walls have been festooned with banners representing the Guild, the city, the grand arena, and five or six dozen different businesses and conglomerates and brand names and whatever else.

With them, of course, is the usual flotilla of concession stands, souvenir shops, food carts, and of course official arena ticket sellers. There are plenty of different matches to which tickets are being sold, Wild Rose's next bout among them, but the really big deal is the MYSTERY MATCH, ??? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> v. ???, limited seating, buy now for best value!!!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does Ir get free tickets to hand out or are we gonna have to buy seats to this?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She does, but not for lack of trying on the Guild's part. Blossom was shrewd enough to catch that one, fortunately.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Boy, I'm really starting to not like these Guild guys!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anything the Squared Circle needs to get done or make sure of before they hop into their bronze-age limousine and head for the entrance square?<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom's ready. Blossom's SO ready. Ever since she had this idea, it's like there's been something crawling around underneath her skin, itching to get out.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, it's not illegal yet. Fair game!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At any rate, the Squared Circle's wagon is just one of many in the streets of Nexus that morning. It's perhaps distinguished by the fact that it's pulled by a pair of hearty emas birds rather than cheaper and less reliable horses, but enough of the wealthy are at least intrigued by the arena's massive ad campaign that it doesn't render you an object of serious suspicion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe the way other wagons or crowd goers part for you as you approach the central plaza - either willingly or because they've been rudely pushed aside by guards and other facilitators - is unusual, but, hell, the Guild does all sorts of quiet boring logistical stuff.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, everyone's attention is on the other side of the square. Specifically, on the great gates, which keep shaking.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A slow, steady, thump... thump... thump... is transforming by degrees into a BOOM... BOOM... BOOM. A deep rumbling is becoming increasingly audible. An announcer, his voice magically amplified by a twisted, coral-encrusted seashell he's speaking into from a podium on the far side of the square, is doing his absolute best to heighten expectations and concentrate adrenaline - it's <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> coming! No... THEY'RE coming! Something great! Something terrible! Could it be the deadliest threat this city's faced yet?!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I'm assuming the Squared Circle split up once they hit the Plaza - Eikichi and Ying to someplace with a nice view, Blossom and Ir hidden from sight on the other side of the square from the rumbling gates.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's easily arranged. If need be, Ying and Eikichi could've benefited from some VIP treatment, and had a way made for them to the very front of the crowd or even into some high seats.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Need definitely be.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah, so there is aught can be done.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anyway, the mood of the crowd is reaching a fever pitch. They're shouting at the announcer and at each other, desperately buying event tickets before - upon the revelation of the actual fighters - the price goes up, scarfing down sausages-in-buns and cups of shaved ice... and then the sun reaches its zenith and the gates explode open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I do mean explode; there's a flash of fire behind them, and the great wood-and-metal doors are smoking as the whip around on their hinges and slam into the wall. Barreling in through them, completely unfettered, is a pair of enormous tyrant lizards!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sigh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah!! Yeah!!!!!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Completely unfettered.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Time to go to work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Announcer: "Oh, no. Oh, no! It's the TWIN DRAGONS!" And he's partially right. The two creatures have near-identical builds and scales, down to their brow ridges and spinal bumps and so on, and each has the same tiger stripe pattern running down its length, but they're of complementary rather than identical colors. One's a deep orange, and one's an ashen, purplish grey.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's hooting and hollering.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everybody loves dinosaurs. I don't care who you are, that's fun, right there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Astute observers will note that while these lumbering monsters are literally unfettered, that may not be the metaphorical case; there's a small encampment of wagons and guards and observers and so on behind them, on the other side of the gates, and they don't appear to have been eaten or incinerated or something.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying's a little more reserved than Eikichi, but he's right. He's right! Dinosaurs are awesome!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In particular, a lanky and lightly-dressed southerner seems to be keeping himself within some twenty or thirty yards behind them, the air around him rippling as he stares at them hard.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does it look like Ir's about to break kayfabe?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nah.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Alright then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She is concerned about this whole...concept...though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Most people don't notice this, because they're busy shrieking as the primordial reptiles cough cones of elemental destruction into the air. One plume of raging fire and one howling blizzard go stabbing into Nexus's sky.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Seems dumb!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Announcer: "It would take an army! It would take a legion! It would take a wyld hunt for even a CHANCE against these monstrosities! Who, who, WHO, could POSSIBLY-- what's this?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And here we go.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At the signal, Blossom takes the smoke bombs she begged from Ying days ago out of a small sack and tosses them!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> While the crowd's attention was elsewhere, one last banner was hoisted up behind a dais right before Ir's wagon - it's a field of solid color across which points a silver spear.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With a PSSSSSH white smoke begins to billow out, obscuring Ir and Blossom herself and wreathing the dais in mysterious, misty tendrils.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She raises a hand, one finger pointed to the heavens. If this doesn't work, she's going to look very foolish. Blossom never considers the possibility for a moment.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are no storm clouds in the sky, no hint of rain, but a blue lightning bolt streaks down from the sky with a CRASSSH, briefly illuminating the smoke clouds with a coruscating blue!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In Blossom's hands now is a zither that any musician would recognize as a masterwork. Perfectly constructed of aged songwood from the East, inlaid with electrum spelling out Old Realm runes that read, in a rough translation: THIS MACHINE SLAYS DARKNESS.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sugoi~<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom takes a deep breath, readies the zither with the heel of one hand on the custom distortion pedal, and begins to sing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZD3FAUqJEg<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As she sings, spinning pinwheels of fireworks seem to appear from nowhere out of the smoke, and beams of flashing light shine upwards, illuminating the bottoms of the clouds.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everyone across the square can hear her perfectly - her voice reverberates from wall to wall without diminishing in strength. "THE SUN GOT UP ONE MORNING HE WAS IN AN UGLY MOOD / HE WAS SICK OF FLOODS AND PLAGUES HE WANTED SOMETHING REALLY RUDE / HE MADE A BIG SIAKA OUT OF BROKEN GLASS AND GLUE / THEN HE GAVE HER TWO LEGS AND A NASTY ATTITUDE"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *_*<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying is on her feet screaming along from the moment Blossom starts singing. This! Is! Incredible!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Through the smoke, something golden begins to burn through.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (This song is RIDICULOUS.)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (...And cool.)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As one, the Twin Dragons turn to Blossom's performance, and to the cloud of smoke from which beams of light are firing. The red one snarls, taking a menacing step forward. The blue one narrows its eyes and draws back, as though a viper about to strike.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then the smokecloud ripples and explodes away, torn apart by a burning pillar of sunlight that drives up into the heavens.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There, standing in similarly-burning golden armor, with a great looming anima spearmaiden standing tall behind her, is Ir.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Announcer: "... Ir! It's Ir, Twice-Traitor! Ir, Chosen of the Sun, and EXCLUSIVE participant in the NEXUS GRAND ARENAAAA!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Announcer: "Can SHE stand up to the elemental tyrants?!" That kind of talk has a lot of purchase in Nexus, of course. In the River Province in general, really.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Man, I dunno, maybe don't put "Twice Traitor" on the bill, that just kinda leads to questions--<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Whatever. She sticks the landing. Iscariot is dancing around her as the smoke burns away, without her seeming to even move as she stares down the Tyrant Lizards...and points.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The crowd's deathly silent as the two "dragons" - again, moving as one - both flinch. They draw back, mouths tightening and eyes widening, but thanks to the force of Ir's presence and the magnetic power of Blossom's music neither can so much as look away, and certainly not turn and run.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Is 'deathly silent' the mood we were going for here...?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This carny stuff is hard.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The tableau of the glowing, gold-and-silver Chosen pointing imperiously at the two practically-cowering elemental monsters persists for five or six seconds before the crowd erupts into wild cheers. As Blossom's performance draws to a close, and as the tall handler of the two beasts begins gesticulating behind them, the tyrant lizards turn slowly away and slink back out through Nexus's <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> gates, growling and grumbling to themselves but not so much as snapping at the crowd to their left and right.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Phew.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Announcer: "SundaysundaySUNDAY this disagreement is settled once and for all, ladies and gentlemen of Nexus! At noon exactly, in the grand Nexus arena! Show up early! Buy your tickets earlier still! Don't forget our other events-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All the pent-up energy of the crowd finally spills outward here as people rush in for tickets, or to try to follow the tyrant lizards out the gates, or to beg Ir and Blossom for autographs or similar. The Guild's there for you to block them off as you gracefully leave, unless you desire otherwise.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yeah, no autographs yet.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Haven't even won anything.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In the following days, news of the event rages through the city like wildfire. Elementally infused mutants like those creatures are precious rarities even when they don't come in matched pairs, and Ir's probably the first of the Chosen of the Sun to operate openly and with full endorsement of the Guild and city rather than in secret except during insanely grisly public disturbances. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The match is sold out before the day is through, and soon enterprising engineers and thaumaturgists are working on using lightweight building materials to build the arena stands even higher, or arrange for a small fleet of observation balloons, or similar.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once all four solars are back in the carriage, Blossom leans back smugly: "You're going to be the most popular match in Nexus history."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying's humming the theme Blossom sang and swaying back and forth. Incredible.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's banished the armor. "Surely there's been something more impressive than Tyrant Lizards on a card."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi lets out a strangled squeak of excitement when Blossom and Ir get back in the carriage. "That was AWESOME"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Nice work on the intro, though."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In fact, a Guild official is talking to Blossom and Eikichi before the day is through - how easily can you, say, project an image of the fight to distant viewers?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I don't know, how easily can we do that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh Sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It would depend on how distant... and she has to be singing for it to work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unfortunately, sorcerous projects generally take a week's time, and you've got like four days. Maybe you can discover an appropriate artifact somewhere...? If it's something you're seriously interested in you can put your back into it over the rest of the week.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anything else the Circle wants to do in that time?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What was that about academic lectures on the nature of the Wyld?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi'll probably be looking into that unless Blossom or somebody has something else they want to do.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying will be checking up on the dead drop as well as looking into the plague, and whether anyone's come to check it out after the fact.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One evening, Blossom's leaning on the wall near the door to Eikichi's room, holding part of his Death's Notaries costume and the glittery cape from his horrible outfit.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Hold up there, Magistrate Billowing-Cape's-Rose."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's just on his way to wash his face and write a while before bed when he sees Blossom holding things for him to wear. He glances up and down the hall before whispering "...out here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The new scholarship on the relation of the Wyld to the stars is in fact being spearheaded by noted scholar Alferi, the fat southerner who Tatsuya rescued from the rakshastan floating above the Hedgehog and who Eikichi cured of mutation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "How can you sleep... how can any of us sleep... when there's crime afoot?!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Get dressed. We're going to lurk the rooftops and punish ne'er-do-wells."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Alferi's a member of the "Dolmen of Learning", a barely-secret-these-days society of occultists and historians mostly populated by graduates of the Serigala Gymnasium. Upon his return, he penned a whole mess of scrolls about what he's calling the 'stellar Wyld', a long-overlooked portion of the formless chaos surrounding Creation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying finds nothing at the dead drop... yet. But it's a good habit to get into. Assuming nothing takes her out of comission and that she keeps checking every day or at least every few days, I'll let you know once Brueghel's got another mission for the Notaries.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi blinks. "Oh. Oh, okay!" He'll take the cape and mask and duck inside his room. He comes back out dark, masked, and shimmering, hat in hand. "What's the plan?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In her trips to and fro, Ying does pick up on the fact that - to her delight, or her horror? - Eikichi's last public spectacle has made something of a splash in the city's visual imagination. People are asking each other where this "Ying" person's shop even is, and speculating that he or she might be some magistrate or financier's private clothier, or something. She might do well to <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> capitalize on this before it either diffuses or gets caught by someone else.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom shakes her head. "Uh-uh. Not this time. You're the dashing hero, I'm just the humble sidekick. We're following your plan, as long as it isn't 'go to sleep instead'. This is your city- where are the people preyed upon by bandits and sneak-thieves? Where do the people cry out for the watchful justice of Magistrate Billowing-Cape's-Rose?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi flips his hat over in his hands as he looks at Blossom, unreadable behind the mask. "...alright. Meet me on the roof in five minutes."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She grins eagerly. "I'll be there."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh no. Oh, no no no. No. No! No. This is... not how she wanted to make a name for herself... but she can't let someone else ruin her reputation. She made Eikichi's outfit badly on purpose. It took a lot of time, effort, and skill to make something that terrible. A real eye for what works, deliberately ignored! And maybe they just want to know who could make something so skillful, and they won't want just copies of that outfit. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Please.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom will find 'the Magistrate' kneeling contemplatively on the hotel's roof, overlooking the canal, his cape billowing and glittering majestically behind him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is she coming out as anyone in particular?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying has already seen some people with boxy little satchels worked into the fronts of their belts. It IS pretty convenient.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Noooo<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll be wearing her Invincible Scholar Princess getup, but without Ying's help she doesn't resemble the Princess except in clothing and the large round glasses. She's kept the boots, Eikichi will note.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will note that. For his part, Eikichi looks pretty much exactly like Friend-of-the-Far-Side. The outfit's spectacular but in terms of makeup and so forth it was basically just him under the hat and mask. He can even recolor his own hair. Ying's put him through more ambitious projects. "In Nexus, there's always somebody who needs protection they're not getting. A voice in the <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> darkness nobody is there to hear."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And so go the following few days for the Squared Circle. Ying struggles to set up shop premises, Eikichi and Blossom both fight crime and brainstorm how an apocalyptic battle might be televised, and Ir racks her brains to remember who it was that talked her into this so that she can begin to properly debate killing them.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The mariachis are beginning to pack up their instruments. Around them, the last tourists filter out of the little Old Town compound. The grounds crew passes by, extinguishing a few street lamps as businesses begin to shutter for the evening. The sudden dimming of light makes everyone’s shadow longer and more indistinct. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abigail Gannon, the Ambassador to San Diego, is rather embarrassed at her offer. Her servant holds open a small case. Inside are a pair of featureless white porcelain masks on red silk. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If they're precisely identical, Cav will take the one on the left.<br>

There’s no requirement, of course, to wear anything that you don’t want to, and I’d certainly understand you refusing it, Baron. But it may smooth things over with the more…traditional…Court members you’ll meet…” Abigail raises an eyebrow. “Well…I do have the extra, so….” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's holding her fire here. Wilson Frost might not even have been on the train, and he hasn't reacted one way or other if not. If it was her.. but she wouldn't be here if she was Nosferatu.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Ambassador and her assistant look around. “Oh. I could have sworn he was here. Nervousness wasted, I suppose.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav checks his phone. "He should be here shortly."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the lamps fade, KJ realizes that in the shadows cast by the lamps, there are about a half dozen figures standing there that she hadn’t noticed before. She can’t make much of them beyond their presence. They don’t move. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A car pulls up into the big lot near the platform, an oldish SUV. Wilson slides out of the back while two women come out of the front seat and go around back. There's the sound of boxes moving. Wilson's wearing a sort of puffy white vest over his usual suit. He's only a few quick steps from the others. "Baron. Baron. Ambassador."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav sees them well enough. Tall, wearing the porcelain masks. clothed in black robes that reach from head to toe. They’re still enough that they look like black pillars, and tall enough to make the people milling about look like children. There must be half a dozen of them, spread out through Old Town, looking in their direction. If he turns to look, he can see one standing in the shadow of the raised freeway as well. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson doesn't see them. He makes a habit of not looking around in strange places. Makes you look nosy or paranoid. He does see the masks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Doesn't say anything yet. But he sees them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Hello, Baron Hollywood. Welcome to San Diego."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For a moment KJ doesn't know what Cav's on about, but when she's turning to greet Wilson she sees them. An ambush by the Brilliant Court after all? Too many to be observers? She tenses, something in her blood rather than actual muscle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cavanaugh, on the other hand, is the sort who will look directly at them.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Are they invisible to everyone else? He glances over at KJ. She can see them, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh no."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe it has something to do with the masks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (KJ's expression hasn't changed, but she's looking the same way Cavanaugh is. Probably due to not having seen enough rather than any particular phlegmatism.)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "It was kind of wild. I got this technicolour shawl, see-" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby is busy going through the list of people to more or less avoid: “Count San Ysidro, definitely the Count of Coronado, hmm, the Prince of Tijuana-“ She bows when she sees Wilson. “Oh! Hello, Baron. Just give me a moment-“ She signals to her assistant, who runs over to the few remaining mariachis and gestures quickly. With a look of weariness, they begin to play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qadKIvx3mc<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Prince of Tijuana, huh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson puts his hands up. "Please, please. I appreciate it, but you fellas are up late enough as it is."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then she sees where they’re looking at, raises a hand to her eyes to get a better look, her smile tightening. “Hmph. Just a few local characters. The local Nosferatu community is a bit tight-knit. Very insular. And wrapped up in this whole religion thing. Well, don’t pay them any mind. It’s not as if they’re likely to talk to you even if you go up and say hi, anyway.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "So how does this...work? Can only we see them?" He glances around. "Am I walking into some kind of 'masquerade violation' joke?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Oh. Well, if they're cool with being talked about in the third person while in earshot, we're all good here?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Vampires are fucking weirdos, man.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby: “They’ve been here longer than anyone. If they’ve ever had trouble with the Masquerade, it’ll be the first I’ve heard of it.” She checks her schedule. “I think that’s everything on my end. Where’s your driver? I expect the Princess has sent someone…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Worst comes to worst, we all cram in with Baron Hollywood or hope Uber knows where 'Casa Figueroa de Solano y Medina' is."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On cue, a young man in full livery dress who had been hovering around the edges steps forward. “Good evening, uh, Barons. I’ll get your things and put them in the car, if you don’t mind.” He indicates a limousine parked nearby. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav gives the figures one last look. He's not using Auspex. They're definitely just, standing right there. But if he doesn't look at one of them directly it's hard to see any of them, let alone tell what they look like. And everyone else just seems to be going about their business.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's ghouls have several bags they're unloading from the SUV, as well as a massive black leather case that looks sized for an upright orchestra bass.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He shakes his head.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's getting in. You don't take the serape and then turn down the limo ride.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soon, the limo pulls out of the parking lot and into the freeway. They can see the huge, dark bays again as they head to the northwest. Eventually, the suburbs thin out. The driver pulls off onto the side streets after a while, and they can see the roads begin to be lined with huge cypresses and oaks. The houses here seem to be bigger and further apart. As they drive, it’s hard to get much of a look around because of the <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Did we even end up taking the masks? If so, this is an opportunity- to Wilson: "You want we should throw these things out the window?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He makes a face at the masks. "Are those for me?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson snorts.<br>

The intercom cracks: “Just a few more minutes until we arrive.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This is really out there.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ sounds a little more serious: "For better or worse, coming and going from this place will have us.. associated in peoples' minds.

Once inside, the land around them levels off, plateauing for at least a mile in each direction. As they drive through, the landscape changes from rough chapparal to manicured lawns, fields, hedges, and garden plots. They can see statues and fountains, occasionally. If they roll the windows down, the smell of lavender will come to their noses, and <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> they’ll realize that the main causewway is flanked on both sides by half-acres of the flowers. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When you play the game of friends, you either win or it's sort of awkward.<br>

The land here is cupped like an ampitheater, the gardens and fields leading down to a central estate of many wings and an ornate architecture. A huge staircase dominates the front, and the driveway is lined with servants and helpers. Beyond, the land curves so that the entirety of La Jolla is exposed to their view; a huge, glittering semi-circle stretching to either side of <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's definitely what you picture when you picture 'the home of the Princess La Jolla'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No matter how rich he's gotten, the aesthetics of the really, really old, really, really rich are still off-putting.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When the limo pulls up, they can see that the entrance staircase has been decorated with wreaths of flowers and reams of white silk ribbons. A hand-painted wooden sign reads: WELCOME HONORED GUESTS. As soon as the engine turns off, servants are taking their luggage discreetly around the back. On the staircase are two women, one dressed in a black dress, white collar, and top hat, the other in an extremely comfortable looking <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ballroom dress of white silk with flowers pinned to its sides. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's on board so far.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A trumpet player lets loose a blast from a balcony. The announcement afterwards is in Spanish. “Presenting, for the pleasure of the Princess La Jolla Elena Solano y Medina: Wilson Frost, Baron of Hollywood. Clinton Cavanaugh, Baron of Laguna Beach. K.J. Valentine, Baron of Anaheim.” The servants applaud after each name. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How seriously do the three of them take it? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Quite.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> What's that old saying, it doesn't matter if you believe in God, but if God believes in you?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wait. Maybe that was from a Disney movie.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson pulls off the sarape with a clank. He's wearing a burnished gray breastplate over the puffy vest. He was wearing it, in retrospect, the entire time. Beneath the sombrero he's got a misshapen and alarmed-looking golden mask.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You don't waste a good spotlight. KJ sets the now-gauche serape aside as she steps out of the limo and stands for a moment with her hands in her pockets watching the top of the stairs; she bows once her name's called and starts upward to be presented for the pleasure of the Princess.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson slides out of the limo and bows at the announcement, going up the stairs afterwards.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She doesn’t look particularly fearsome, anyway. The Princess, as the one in the white silk dress appears to be, waits for them to ascend to the second level of the staircase, inclining her head as they each make it up. A mastiff sits in a relaxed manner by the feet of the woman in a top hat. After they all arrive, the latter speaks first, in a surprising rasp. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Greetings, honored guests. We are honored to host friends of our family. I am Dona Eva de la Campa, the Princess’s second. I trust you have all traveled and arrived without incident? One small matter - do any of you not speak Spanish? We will assign you help fluent in the language of your choosing during your stay here.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav indicates he's fine in Spanish, even though his player isn't.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Dona Eva keeps it in English, then. “Of course. We are delighted to help the envoys of the Princess’s brother-in-law in any way we can.” Another trumpet blast sounds from somewhere on a balcony. “Elena Ignacia Figueroa de Solano y Medina, Princess La Jolla.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Princess puts out a small hand, palm down. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson takes her hand gently and bows.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Princess waits patiently until the formalities have been observed. Then: “Baron Frost, I do not endorse the backwards custom of Nosferatu masking themselves. Please do not imagine that anything except your own comfort may demand that you wear one in this house.” She draws a shawl around her shoulders. “Chilly, isn’t it? Let’s go into the atrium. Eva, could you have everything brought to us there?” Her English has<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> no discernible accent, and leads them further into the house as she speaks. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh, whew. Wilson takes the mask off.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav, murmuring: "Guess that means no stilts."<br>

Through a set of double doors, she stops them in a large enclosed garden, walled off with glass and wrought-iron transparent sliding doors. The space is filled with beds of flowers, comfortable looking chairs, overhanging oak boughs, and the sound of running water from several <br>

Discreetly, small cards with the wine list printed on them are pressed into your hands. The Princess sits you all in a circle, a flat stone table between you. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ehhh. He shouldn't.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> After the servants have left, Eva takes a seat by herself on a fountain’s stone base. The Princess sips champagne slowly. “We have blood, as well, of course. Though I ask that you imbibe privately.” She rests her elbow on a pillow and leans forward. “So. I imagine that traveling to a foreign city, while your Prince leaves the city and your enemies remain free to plot against you, has made this assignment more stressful <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> than you would like.” <br>

She insisted that they enjoy themselves for the night while they think about it, so they’ve also been given the run of the carnival grounds at Belmont Park, which has <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Nobody who would intervene on behalf of the Carmelites, at least.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But frankly, Cav suspects the powers that be in San Diego would look extremely unkindly on anyone from Los Angeles attempting to interfere with a San Diego pogrom as if it were their territory.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Which is exactly what we're being asked to do. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 'Who in Los Angeles has the will and the authority to do anything without Bailey around' is its own weird, thorny question even without the heist. "I wonder how many scripts you could get out of things the Princess does just because."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Yeah, this park answers some questions by itself!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> We're being asked to rob them sneakily. This is less insulting than what KJ is proposing, because it inherently shows we know we're in the wrong.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the three Barons wander through the stalls and rides, all three notice them eventually. The tall figures, so tall that Cav thought they must be wearing stilts, dressed in black robes. In the night’s coastal mist, their white porcelain masks make them look even more ghostly. The Nosferatu stand far away, but they can be seen, peering through the latticed supports of roller coasters, or half-hidden behind canvas walls. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Enough of that. I'm going to ask them what's up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Something about the sight of them in the mist and their masks strikes Wilson very deeply. He doubles back to the Princess. "Should we be talking about this with those guys watching us?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh, hello there.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How do they do that?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Princess is watching Eva attempt to throw a mini-basketball through a tiny basket. “You will be working with them if you accept the offer. I think that they are trying to see how you move and speak.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "So- fitfully, and with sudden decision."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Which is the same way she moves into shadow, or into never having been present. Likely very familiar to the watching figures. But will they notice a woman approach, hands in her pockets, mind screaming lullabies?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav blinks and looks around. Wilson is still here at least, right?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This one doesn’t. As she closes on it, the mask remains fixed forward, watching Wilson and Cav. When she gets closer, KJ can see that the mask she thought was featureless is actually carefully and subtly decorated with shallow carvings. A single small blue gem hangs under its right eye. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Over talking to the Princess. "Who's their leader?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Far faster than a mortal can move, KJ's outside of the park's public areas, under the canvas by the gem-masked pillar of a.. man? That or monster, depending on the mask.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Hey. You can watch, but what's your angle?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Being the only one without Obfuscate can be incredibly jarring from time to time.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Says the guy whose claws aren't visible.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> La Jolla: “A man named Ferdinand. I don’t think he’ll appear here.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The robed figure doesn’t start. It does turn to look down at KJ in a smooth motion, though. “Oh…hello.” Its (his?) voice is suprisingly high-pitched and boyish. “…I guess I’m watching you to see what you’re like.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav's main concern is this: how does performing this heist, even to exact specification and plan, stop the San Diego court from carrying out its pogrom anyway?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "Sure. Here's what I'm like: I want to understand things. Would you please tell me why you and your cohort want to help get these papers?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll walk over and raise this question to the Princess directly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It might be more accurate to say that KJ wants to know things; she'll provide the understanding herself. But people don't react as well to that.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wonder why.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "Would Ferdinand be involved in this? If we got caught, who besides us would get caught up?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The robed figure inclines its head in a nod. “If we don’t, the lords and the priests will come for us and we won’t be able to stop them from killing our friends. But if we take those papers from the Great Prince, some of us can escape from this place.” He pauses. “Are you the spy?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> La Jolla: “You will be given a duplicate set of papers. Forgeries, identical in every way except for the blood magic proving their authenticity. But the guards will not notice they have been replaced until it is too late. The ideal result is that no one notices the real papers are missing until we have moved those people who are in danger out of the city. Then, when they move, their hand will grasp at empty air.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "That could start a war."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Ferdinand will only be involved in an indirect sense. You will see him at the gathering. Members of his clan will be more intimately involved. If you get caught, then as my guests, your capture and imprisonment will be my responsibility.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ: "So it's you and yours. Fine. Please forgive the blunt question, but- why should we help you when it risks restarting a war which will kill even more people?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> La Jolla puts down the dart she was about to throw at a wall of balloons. “The war is ongoing. It may make things more uncomfortable between my court and yours, yes. But it will continue whether you choose to involve yourself or not, or whether your court sides with one side or the other.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "But then why should we, specifically, intervene?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The robed figure stands, unsure. “The Princess…she has family where you come from, doesn’t she? Someone told me they’re very powerful. Wouldn’t they owe you a favor?” It stands silently. Then: “Please, help us. They’ll kill so many of us.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> La Jolla: “Are you asking about your reward, or your court’s?” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The limousine takes them away from the beach and the carnival, back up into the hills and the grand estate.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Two nights later, the three Barons are told to dress in armor and report to the palace’s driveway. The drive to Miramar takes about an hour and a half, far past the lights of downtown, far into the endless hill and canyons of San Diego County. There are fewer trees than the wilds of back home down here…until they reach a small, wealthy community near a lake. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The lake is fringed with willows, elms, and cypresses, obscuring dozens of grand manors and modern palaces. At the far end, something incredible stands illuminated. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Rising from the edge of the waters is a huge castle-manor, its turrets and towers bristling with miniature battlements, constructed out of gleaming white marble. Searchlights illuminate its surface, and from the other side of the lake they can see swarms of people milling about in its great courtyard. From its highest tower, they can hear bells chime to mark midnight. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Princess La Jolla descends from a truck, armored in a deep scarlet plate. Eva’s is a pale yellow. Behind them are two dozen retainers all in plate, all in shades of red, weapons all sheathed. “Shall we?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion|&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jesus.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A fleet of rowboats takes you all across the water, the retainers doing the pulling, undead physiques keeping their manicured appearances perfectly still. The great house looms higher as you approach, and the sound of conversation and music gets louder. You can see a sea of armor on the other side. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> As the boats make their way past a short jetty and pull up next to a launch and staircase, a trumpeter sounds a high note from a balcony. <br>

There's a lot of weather like that in this part of the Threshold. The clouds are tinged red by the star they obscure, and people are still talking about all the bad news that keeps trickling in: the fall of Thon, the mysterious absence of Council proclamations, the increasing visibility of Lookshyan soldiers <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> in the city, the honey and its prisoners, and of course, the death of the Emissary.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger woke up this morning to the sound of a steady drip-drip-drip on the polished stone floor of the hideout. There's a leak somewhere, hard to see and hard to patch because the place is earthenwork. Mud and Straw's a genius, but it's hard to figure out how to handle maintenance now that he's gone back north.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'd prefer not to draw their attention yet again so soon after the incident with Cathak Tsuka.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The main question is how to find those, without having to go through the Guild itself. Because that's a bit what it's there for.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Guild guildhouses tend to hang their shingles in Nexus's prosperous and fast-moving downtown. Local carpenters, masons, and so forth keep smaller, private practices sprinkled throughout the city's residential neighborhoods. Higher-end (and more expensive) contractors set up in the rich neighborhoods flanking Parko Llana while humbler folk work in the neighborhoods at the foot of Sentinel <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hill.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Chosen craftsmen (which is to say, almost exclusively, dragonblooded craftsmen) virtually all work for the Guild, and the ones that don't tend to head private practices downtown. But you never know. You can find anything in Nexus, so they say.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Humility is a virtue -- but an even better virtue is its closest brother, discretion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger will start in Sentinel Hill, then move on to Parko Llana and, if absolutely necessary, finally venture downtown.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger spends a fair bit of the day, into the afternoon, looking around for people who might be amenable to his work. It's an all-but-impossible needle to thread, though: people in the working-class neighborhoods hate the Guild and the Anathema both, people in the richer neighborhoods don't mind Anathema but Stranger realizes most of them are angling to get bought out by the Guild, <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and the contractors downtown hate the Guild fiercely, don't care about Anathema, but wouldn't be caught dead in Floodwater.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So it goes. But the search is worth it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Downtown is where he finds his best lead, from the apprentice working under a stern Earth Aspect master mason who's been tapped to screen prospective clients. How oblique is Stranger about his parameters? Would a socially inept teen be able to tell that Stranger wanted someone who didn't want to sell out, wasn't repulsed by the poor, and isn't frightened by the risk of association with <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anathema when there's a Wyld Hunt in town?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That depends on how trustworthy and virtuous Stranger finds the teen.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He seems too earnest and frankly dense to be duplicitous. Stranger sees him thumbing a locket stuck on the end of prayer beads. It only takes a brief conversation to identify him as a mama's boy, gone into the workforce out of necessity because his father passed. Not the kind of worker Stranger's after, but, the kind of kid Stranger can trust won't fuck him over.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then he is more than willing to be as indiscreet as necessarily up to just before the point of actually saying the word 'Anathema,' or identifying himself directly as one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The boy: "Oh, no, sorry. I don't think I can help you. That's quite a conundrum, sir." A half-grin, memory-spurred. "I guess there's always Old Selin. If you can find him."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That raises an eyebrow. Selin is a rather common name -- but 'old?' Old coots that have been run off for their eccentricities are far more promising than young bucks trying to make their name.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Old Selin, hmm?" Stranger pauses as if thinking about it. "How old?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Oh, I don't know. Master Fahad calls him Old Selin, and Master Fahad's over a hundred."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger supresses a smile. Yes, that's old enough to almost certainly have exalted blood in him. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Say I did want to find Old Selin, then. Where would I begin?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "When Master Fahad wants to hire him, he usually goes to the River Temple around evening bell. But it's raining, so he might be in the Undercity too."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Old Selin's a bum," says the kid with the confident obliviousness of someone who doesn't realize how rude that is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "They give out dinner at the River Temple."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Bless his heart. He's a good boy not to have opinions about bums.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger thanks him for his time and tips him, then begins planning the rest of his day.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The River Temple is a joint monument to the three river mighty river gods who make their home in Nexus, the Maiden in Yellow, Grey, and Great Yanaze. Naturally, it's built right where the rivers merge. And there's dozens of ways into the Undercity, usually at streetcar junctions or along the canals.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah. Grey. Memories.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Time to look for the soup kitchens, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're not hard to find. People ranging from the elderly to families with children eat at the temple. It's one of the bigger crowds Stranger's seen since coming to Nexus. Rare for so many people to mill around in one spot.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's not quite evening bell yet, so people are standing around, or sitting around. There's talking, and laughing, and some music, a couple scuffles, and a whole lot of quietly looking up at the temple waiting for the bells to chime.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Big tureens are being set up under awnings on the temple steps, and there are huge lidded baskets lining the square in some effort to corral the trash.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The rain's thinning out. What's Stranger's approach?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger probably looks poor enough that he can just blend in with the lines.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> While the rain is thinning out, it is still raining, and you'd think that this many people, at least some of them would be exposed to the rain. But standing in line Stranger notices he's stopped getting wet. He looks up to see broad canvas sheets taut like sails, bending the wind above everyone's heads and blowing the rain into the canal, the gutters and the alleyways, and... into <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the inexplicably open windows of the Guild bank across the street from the temple.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A water bank?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's heard of the concept in the South.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But the climate here should render that, ah. Unprofitable.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No, a regular bank. With like... papers and ink.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How odd.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He didn't want to get involved with the Guild as such, but...<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The bank's closed, so nobody's inside. Whoever opens up tomorrow is going to find the second and third floors all but ruined.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now there's a trick.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A bit on-the-nose, however. There will be repurcussions for the soup kitchens -- even if they're mostly petty ones.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Someone else is looking up at the bank windows, further ahead in the line. An old man in a knit cap, with a long, shaggy beard obscuring his long, thin neck.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger is now guessing that the whole 'guild-hating' thing is what got through to the young lad in his apprenticeship.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will not approach until after the man has gotten his food, and preferably he'll hang around long enough Stranger can get his as well.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Soup kitchens can have excellent food, are noble enterprises, and he HAS spent all this time in line.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The food here is good! A lot of people knock temple food because it's free, but, those people have never had temple food. Stranger gets a bowl of some kind of vegetable stew and a piece of bread.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now that reminds him of home.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Now that reminds him of home.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ...Gary's home, at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Once Stranger's gotten his food -- where's the old man?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger sees the old man sitting in a circle with several other old men in the light of temple lanterns. One of them unpacks a bag of polished stones and sets them out on the ground between the men as they eat and argue.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will walk over, then. Is there any obviously clear place to sit, if he wishes to invite himself in? And what's the deal with these stones, so he doesn't get blind-sided by some obscure riverman honor game?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The old men are spaced out enough that there's places Stranger could sit without invading anyone's personal space. It takes him a moment since there's no board underneath, but he soon realizes that those polished stones are (fairly abstract) Gateway pieces. They're talking about a board position.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ah, Gateway. The preferred game of geniuses, real and imagined, for ages.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger has never given it much time or thought. How does the board position look?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's a mess. White has no good moves that Stranger can see, while Black's position is commanding. But the more he looks at it, trying to figure out how to win, the more precarious Black's position seems. Any of the obvious moves open Black up to devastating counterplay and a huge loss of material and position.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger: "Storm's coming."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does he pass the eye test enough to just sit down without a challenge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger: "I wouldn't bet on Black."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unless Stranger's bought more expensive-looking clothes than he wore into Nexus, the only thing that'd mark him out is the sword, if he's wearing it. Humble as it is, Stranger could eat for a month off what he'd get for selling it.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's not carrying a sword. He's carrying a cane, which they might be able to identify as splitting into a sword.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And he hasn't washed the clothes in awhile.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then Stranger's probably fine. He gets the sense that this is pretty informal.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll take a seat that's a respectful distance from the others -- not too close, not too far. What's his prospective guess at Old Selin up to? Has he already finished his stew and bread?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Old Selin eats like a bird, picking at his food slowly while he argues with the others. Everyone else is trying to figure out Black's winning move, while Old Selin picks apart their strategies by outlining counterattacks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger is content to watch, then. He's not equipped to engage in a battle of strategic wits with the old man -- at least not at Gateway -- and he somehow doubts the man would be all too impressed by a know-it-all showing up like this anyhow.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man Stranger suspects is Old Selin proposes a counterattack that gets the other men all conferring among themselves. This is when he notices Stranger. "Hello. It's nice to meet you."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger slightly bows his head. "You as well."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "A Gateway player?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sometimes. It gets people talking."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger shakes his head. "Sadly, no. It was not a respected pursuit where I grew up."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "You're never too old to learn something new."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The silver-haired man smiles. "True."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Where are you from? I haven't seen you around before."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger: "I haven't been around much. I grew up on the banks of the Grey. Merchants, we were -- fishermen, mainly, but we had our fields to tend to as well. Stiff competition. Never went hungry, but routinely went poor. Gateway was...a Guild game."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "That's the power of geography. Here, this game is one of the few things in Nexus the Guild doesn't own."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Stranger nods and takes another bite of bread. When he's no longer speaking with his mouthful: "This is my first time up this way, however. I've been staying in Floodwater. Getting by. Doing well enough for myself, though still between work."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>03:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I like it there."<br>

You're in Ynkblot's 'office', the trailer with a jungle on the inside, in a park off International Drive. The war-leader himself paces, snapping leaves and twigs, before coming to a stop behind his desk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The fuck is a--<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "They've really fucked up now. Your people, I mean. We'll have to lose you, Cleaner."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Still more to be done here, much more, but apparently Panopticon's understaffed. Don't understand why exactly that's my problem."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You know a bit of what he's talking about but the details are fuzzy. Was what went on at Cape Canaveral really that bad? Like the man says- there's a lot more to do in Orlando.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's in his deputy black and tans, the top button undone, no tie. He's taken off his sunglasses indoors. "My people."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Was hoping to stay over on this side of the line for another few weeks." Cleaner uncrosses his legs.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "So it goes."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Weeks earlier, on Grand Cayman, Orient has cause to reflect on his life and choices.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He doesn't smoke indoors. Tries not too, anyway. Unless he's invited. "You need me to tie anything off on my way out?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The setting is picturesque- a little natural harbour with old colonial ruins up the hill and a new tourist town in danger of becoming a resort. The stakes should low as he is, after all, on holiday. But somehow the Eye always finds him, and today that takes the form of an evil old man in a bright cotton shirt, capering about as he spits nonsense predictions. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A plain man, his plain suit rumpled by many late nights of work, sits like a pharoah's statue at the interrogation table. "That's all correct." Epiphany sweats; the room is too warm. He's another minute from reaching for his handkerchief.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Parrots kick up a racket in the background. It can't all be nonsense - Orient's heard the description of this guy before, some sort of rogue and hermit who used to be an expert in Time magic. Now apparently he's reduced to ambushing innocent travellers to deliver them unwanted prophecies.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So as not to create any misperception of charity: "Figure you paid for another few weeks of my services, least I can do is my job."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It could be worse. Orient squeezes Bianca’s hand a little tighter when he sees the man and the energy that surrounds him, and doesn’t realize he’s doing it until his wife turns to look at him, wondering. “Sorry,” he says, putting it out of his mind. Underneath his Olympian IIs, he watches the man come closer. He doesn’t feel any real fear. Just a local character looking for a mercy from the vacationing couple dressed in<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> white shirts and white shorts. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot is very much a Pratorian water-carrier. "That's right, your people. Only one worth a damn on site is Trajan- well, we'll transfer your beat back to Caveat, it's fine. Frankly, the Tetrarchy doesn't care what we do here as long as there's a lid on it. Kennedy on the other hand needs people yesterday."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Literally yesterday. Can you fucking believe it? Three men in space. Ley lines are quivering throughout the hemisphere."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sounds bad." Cleaner's voice is even and unconcerned.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He stands. "That be all?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Baikonur, the first man debriefing Epiphany: "So what you called a- a star, it was similar in scope to our own sun? A full-sized stellar body?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "What? No, sit-" The Brigadier-Sublime gestures irritably. This is a place of his power, and a great toadstool springs forth from the ground, fungus twisting into a crude approximation of a stool. It looks surprisingly clean.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner cocks his head slightly -- the greatest show of emotion he's made so far -- and sits back down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I've got your orders, man, we're all together on this one. Except perhaps for the Man, but you know-" He's referring to the Minister of Hegemon - a poor joke, but thankfully just that. The Ministry are known not to be fans of what your own people are doing with the space program, but it's neither something they'd act upon or anything that would engage the terrifying and remote figure who actually leads that organisation.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Despite the sweating, there's no tension to Epiphany's posture. Limbs and hips and shoulders at flawless ergonomic angles give the impression of someone arranging themselves the way someone of particular temperament might use a straightedge to arrange a desk. "I couldn't guess its size or distance. As you pointed out, I wasn't using any instrumentation. But in that moment I interpreted <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> what I saw as another sun."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The rogue prophet meanders right up to Orient, invading personal space like one of the beggars out of the town- he isn't trying to sell anything, though. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man stinks. "Advice, stranger, advice from a stranger, some stranger advice."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot continues: "You're to take over the program from Lewis, form a real pylon there with some specialists they're bringing in. One's going to be at the Jetport in 24 hours. Nothing written down on this one, but here are your objectives informally - you'll have a real briefing later on."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio doesn’t move. Both he and Bianca are too polite to do anything except smile pleasantly. “Good evening.” The man spoke in English, and Claudio does as well: crisp, only very slightly accented. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Provisionally, for what it's worth, you are now an Oracle of the Third Order and Tenant-Intraordinary in the Ministry of Panopticon. Again, that will be confirmed by someone who gives a shit. There are three things your team will need to do." He's talking at a mile a minute here, maybe in case Cleaner just walks out again.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second Russian interrogator: "Which would answer a number of questions-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator: "Too many, and it asks more. The question of Paradox has been raised."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second interrogator: "Staff report no errors in the night's willworking."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator: "Apart from you."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Rogue prophet: "An evening, by God, and we're even good. Good in His eyes. Aren't we?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Epiphany reaches for his handkerchief and dries his brow entirely before speaking. "I can only repeat what I did and what I saw. It's not my place to offer conjecture."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The first interrogator shuffles his papers, marks something in runes of the High Speech. It's hard to read them upside down. "You've enough experience, you're respected enough to.. interpret. Nobody's asking for that."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The second interrogator: "Do you feel a drive to communicate, to evangelise? Does your.. experience.. speak itself out?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hmm. Does he really want to do this, right now? Bianca flies home in the morning. The lights are coming on all across the town. He decides that he does not. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “So sorry. No speak English.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The irritating prophet gapes in surprise. "Speak? Hear? Where you're going you won't need ears for that! It's too loud, blasting off, too lewd."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The water in the bay behind the man is very still and oval. Orient's seen something like it once in a dream.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "First. The next scheduled launch is a dry run and the one after that's supposed to be the real thing. They must not succeed in landing on the surface of the moon. No men, no machines, no cameras. Lewis is out of leeway here; help him handle it or take the fuck over, you and these others."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mm. Well. She’s seen it before. If there were any danger, she’d know, as she’s seen him deal with it before. There isn’t, so they’ll both stand silently, waiting for the messenger to resolve itself into something meaningful. While he waits, he chews on his gum. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Second. Hegemon knew about this before the Tetrarchs, before your own hierarchy. Not the first time that's happened apparently. Needs to stop. As a matter of professional courtesy I won't try to estimate whether Panopticon might be riddled with spies."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Third. Have you ever heard of the Invisible Order?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I feel driven to speak now for cooperation's sake." Perhaps unusual to the interrogators is that Epiphany hasn't once asked them a question. He has been the very model of incurious patience.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient's brief patience bears fruit- maybe sensing its limit, the wrinkled prophet backs off a step and fixes him with a glare before speaking more firmly. "No good in the eyes of God, the Eye of the gods. We won't have a prayer as of four P.M. March third T minus zero. Our final warning, watchers watched."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner never walked out.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He listens in silence, nodding and making non-comittal noises as appropriate.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Second interrogator, after a brief pause: "The operation of the rocket engine upon the air, upon space itself. Describe its action again?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I see. Thank you.” Claudio wonders where in the world it was that the Eye had offended the God, if that’s what he meant. He’ll wait for the other man to stop before asking. “Do you have any specific dates or instructions?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In fact, he’ll look for them himself, in the man’s mind. How is it? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The prophet's mind is a mess. You can see the signs of deliberate damage - his mentality has been torn apart at some point, either by an enemy or the man himself. Probably best not to think about it? But in those ragged channels, there's something.. an entry point for divinity? He sees the future, and probably not of his own volition.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unsentimentally: "Pentacle cabal. Operate in Orange and Brevard Counties. Possible ties to Miami Consilium. Possible ties to." He doesn't trail off, just stops talking. After a short pause, he rephrases. "Interesting how they operate in our territory. Merits a closer look."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Noisy. Inconvenient."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That’s unfortunate. Claudio reaches out and brushes the man’s mind with a restorative intent. Does anything stop him? It would be a cruelty to make someone like this. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Prophet: "Go take a hike. Or a cruise. Can't lose. You can't lose if you invest in the Pharoah's Daughter, Yarmouth Line, out of George Town on Sunday and two weeks to Port Canaveral. Because of the market, you know, the devil you know, better to ride a boat than serve a meal."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He freezes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The damage is deep enough that the original owner of this mind is effectively dead, but you can heal structure, impose something a bit more like regular function. Some of those tears close up. Shards of prophecy remain embedded like splinters, mental welts forming around them, but the patch job could last a long time, and he's old.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The somewhat staggered prophet mumbles something about the offer of a meal. "Room? Plenty of room.. I've got a place, thanks. You've.. well, see you around, enjoy the trip." He's trying to concentrate on something he can no longer feel, figure out what to think instead..<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The two interrogators look at each other as weak light filters in from the Kazakh steppes. Perhaps years of dutiful service and the backing of Paternoster count for something. For this much, at least.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "A simulacrum would be welcome, comrade."

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Looks like he's reading off some notes and perhaps not very carefully.<br>

A produced pen-knife pricks the index finger of his left hand which draws patient script in red smears on the table. НИЧЕГО ИЗ НИЧЕГО When he's done, he licks the tip of his finger and then blows on the words, causing them to flare with white magnesium fire. Epiphany reaches into the flame and turns his hand palm-up. A <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> translucent image projects three-dimensionally in the air, the sight of a rocket launch, something burning, and something beyond.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The vision goes on, and on. One of the men watches, rapt. The other makes it five seconds before he kicks over his chair and stumbles back against the closed blinds, seeming to melt into the fragments of light. Neither Epiphany nor the first interrogator have time to care. The dizzying sense of opened space - the incomprehensible beyond - and beyond the beyond, vast, ordinary yet impossible- <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Within days he's on a plane to America, with a mission of comradely aid; strict admonitions not to speak; and a couple of strange farewells from unexpected persons.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:29</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How unexpected?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> One refers to 'our mutual friend with the white chains', which must be a strange definition of mutual. The other has well-wishes from quite a lot of colleagues who he hadn't thought cared enough to organise such a thing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> How thoughtful.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They must not expect him to return.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, there's a lot of references from unpious fellow-priests to finding the American version of God.. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot turned up again as Cleaner's escort, as well as Caveat and Endless Depths. The others are nervous, hanging around the great lighted cavern of the Orlando Jetport, with the sound of military planes outside but no civilian ones for forty minutes now. The specialists' plane is very late.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He would have preferred to do this with Caveat or, ideally, alone. But he didn't voice that. Didn't seem like a useful discussion to have.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's no need to go searching. America prays to Saturn V.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Outside is the tarmac, military dorms, and the highway - a straight shot east to Titusville and the Indian River. It won't be a long trip once these people actually turn up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner will have parked his car nearby, preferably inside the covered hanger so there's no need for the visitor to ever walk out in the open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's in his civilian clothes now. Off-duty. Black mock turtleneck, charcoal blazer and slacks. Low-top black boots instead of leather shoes.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat stands close, saying nothing, reading a little pamphlet from some sort of philosopher. Endless Depths is down the concourse trying to persuade the Dunkin Donuts to sell one last round of coffee before closing. Ynkblot keeps looking up at the sky and complaining, as if it will stop the sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:39</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Handgun in a shoulder holster under the blazer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> From Henrik David's point of view his plane isn't late. Being able to leave at all is a minor miracle, let alone on this short notice; the small jet he's in doesn't *look* capable of international flights, and indeed according to the steward earlier this is not an international airport.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are just five other passengers, some probably Seers and some probably KGB. The plane's interior is mostly dark now that the sun is setting outside.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> America looks very large, below, and very open.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Late, late, late. Do you think they got to the airline somehow?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:43</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Can't be a damn coincidence that the thing's arriving at sunset."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Apart from talking to Caveat readily whenever she asks and to the other two as much as they require of him, Cleaner will have been silent, leaning against either his car or another likely position, since they arrived.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Henrik David closes his eyes and lets himself feel just the first breath of his relief and exultation before sealing it back up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat's asked a lot of questions about the exact work Cleaner was doing in Orlando, to make sure she's got it straight to take over. She hasn't mentioned the space program once, but has let him see her scrying, trying to get a look at their colleagues on the Cape.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll help her to whatever extent he can, but that's probably by staying out of it and staying in position to cover her. He's never had her talent or interest in the more...abstract arts of magic.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The steward's back, handing Henrik a little plastic bag full of documents. "Sir, your passport and biography. Would you like Baikal or orange juice?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Juice, please." Henrik's trying out his English; he considered trying to disguise his accent but abandoned the idea on the theory that no matter how he sounded, the Americans would assume his accent was Russian anyway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Endless Depths: "Shitwater, the good kind." He's carrying two cups and levitating two more in front of him, shielding them from view with his body - young, but stocky or even fat.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Levitating.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't sigh,<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> *Cleaner doesn't sigh.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat does! "Dumbass," she tells the other Obrimos, but takes a cup. Ynkblot doesn't seem to want one.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He will take the offered coffee and nod thanks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The juice was not very fresh. It's almost dark outside and Henrik feels a little queasy as he carries his belongings down the steps from the small Sukhoi. There's nobody here, which is good because they seem to have landed on some sort of military base; the others, more experienced travellers, are already walking toward a modern looking Terminal building on the other side of the tarmac. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> No stars visible above. A slightly sweet smell in the air. It's crisp, and in the distance he can hear the noise of cars. American cars.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "They're not waiting outside, at least. You've got the car ready? Depths, finish that shit and go set up for an escort."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>11:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner: "The car is ready."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He'll glance over at Caveat when Ynkblot looks away. His expression is bland, but she'll be able to read it: exasperation at this sloppiness.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Mmm. It's good to be on solid ground.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Incongruously, Cleaner hears birdcalls. The airport is full of trees, in pots and in little strips of earth, but he recognises Ynkblot's nimbus. Preparing for trouble.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He unbuttons his blazer. Easy access to the gun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A week into the cruise of the S.S. Pharoah's Daughter, the matter of tickets arises. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hm? What? Claudio has to be woken up, since he’s fallen asleep on a chair on the top deck, half-covered by a quite dated newspaper. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They were sold when the Yarmouth Line vessel initially departed Port Canaveral, an opportunity Oriente didn't have access to as at the time was on a different continent. There might not be a need for him to wake, though- it's Isaias who's been cornered by the grifter.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man claims to be associated with the cruise company and he has a staff shirt. But the offer is unorthodox.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In a little mid-deck hallway, between the cabins and a row of portholes by the ship's pool- "There's basically two ways to deal with your problem."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The sailor smirks. He's sitting on an iron step, blocking the way past. "When we make landfall, there's the Brevard County Sheriff's Department. Or if it turns out you can afford the tickets after all - you and your friend look like you can afford things, one way or another - I can make this go away."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat moves closer to Cleaner. Looks like she's unarmed - not that she needs to be, but it always helps. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This doesn't seem to be a busy airport, though it's gleaming new. Henrik's anonymous fellow travellers bid him anonymous farewells at the unmanned gate, dispersing in various directions - he sees one lighted concourse with people at its end, a janitor moving along the wall between here and there. Everything is very modern and expensive.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She knows pretty well by now that there's a loaded Smith & Wesson Model 27 with an extra quickloader of .357 in the glovebox of his car if she needs it. The window is rolled down.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In addition to the Welrod in his camera bag under the front seat, and the AR-10 in the soft canvas long-bag in his trunk.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They've all heard the plane landing at last. Ynkblot: "Hey, good luck over there. We need you back, but only when this one's in the ground."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Isaias isn’t dressed for relaxation. He’s a slight, thin man with a slight, thin face and dark skin. He looks rather like a shabby academic, in his tweed coat with patches on the elbows and his sweater vest. There’s a light sheen of sweat on his forehead, but it’s from the sun, not from anxiety. In fact, he doesn’t understand the man at all. “Claudio!” Orient snorts awake and looks around. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sailor: <Incomprehensible american words, now sneering.><br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Isaias asks, in Arabic: (What does this guy want?)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient walks over to the steps. “What’s this? Sorry, my friend here - no English. Is there a problem with something?” (Hold on.) That’s spoken in no language at all, just sent into Isaias’s mind. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Henrik sees three American mistika turning toward him, looking bored and relieved. The leader is a wiry but heavily-muscled man, a ranked Seer wearing spells of transformation and power almost visible to the Sleepers closing up shops nearby.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>12:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The others are a woman, a pretty Obrimos with no obvious magic going on (but some magically concealed), and-<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Lead biker, enormously bearded, bellowing: "YALL HAVE REINFORCEMENTS NOW? NICE. NIICE."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner reaches into his blazer pocket, pulls out his mirrored aviators, and slides them on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Henrik just sits back.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Just a couple of minutes to the river. They shouldn't be able to cross.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Biker: "We SAW your men on the plane and we SEE you, into your WRETCHED little souls." The others cackle and sing along to their obnoxious music.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Conversationally, to Henrik David, not speaking up so the bikers can hear but not whispering or lowering his voice either: "Ever staked a vampire?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I have not."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When they hear the accent, the woman on the leader's bike whispers something to him.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Messier than you think."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Biker "Looks like yall are on your way OUT of town which suits us just fine."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Another biker, with a mohawk obviously: "And stay out!!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner, as they're almost on top of the bridge: "Be seeing you, Bishop."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're peeling away reluctantly. Biker: "In HELL yeah you will."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "And if you make it to hell first- you tell em BISHOP FLINT JUGULUM SENT YOU!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "This town belongs to the god damned SABBAT!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Flint Jugulum.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The vampires pull up in a long row by the side of the St Johns River, shadow gathering about them. By the time you're fifty metres away you can no longer see or hear the Sabbat pack, though the road and the traffic on the other side of the bridge are still clear.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner sticks a hand out the window and gives them a peace sign with the back of his left hand as they drive over the bridge.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> On the edge of the forest is a rest stop, where Ynkblot's car pulls up. The others have to head back to town, though they'll likely take a different route in.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe the index finger comes up a second later than the middle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Endless Depths rolls down a window, gestures for you to stop a sec.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner pulls over.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Does he want Cleaner to pull window-to-window like cops do, or stop the engine and get out?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot leans out. Bits of black bark are flaking off his skin. "Sorry about that, comrade old friend!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's yelling past Cleaner to Henrik David.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner doesn't roll his eyes, even under the sunglasses.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We've been dealing with these assholes for months now. Fuck's sake, this should be a Camarilla problem but they've abandoned the area entirely."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Those are apparently the tolerable sort of vampires. Cleaner wouldn't know.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They have the Camarilla in Russia too, probably - it's hard to root the bloodsuckers out entirely, and anyway they've been around long enough to be one of the few credible forces that makes deals with the Iron Pyramid as a whole. These guys must be their offcuts and garbage.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "He claimed to be a Bishop. Is that unusual?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Henrik is talking to Cleaner, since shouting past Cleaner would be rude.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Seems to be a title for their gang bosses. Flint Jugulum there is only one of them."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To the other Seers: "Guy gave his name, if we didn't have it before. I didn't. Flint Jugulum."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The more he says it, the more it sounds like a regular name.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a hatchway to the side of the ship's rather noisy engine room which Orient hasn't seen open before. Inside is some sort of office alright- medical supplies and tins of food are stacked on shelves behind a man who is, indeed, wearing a captain's uniform. You don't recognise him, but how much attention were you paying?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "I don't want his name. I want his jugulum."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Classic Ynkblot.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ynkblot: "Yeah, anyway, they can be dangerous. We'll get them. Until then probably don't cross the river without an escort, the damn Lasombra come out of nowhere."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Bishop guy himself is the dangerous one, though, and he hasn't got that power- doesn't matter, this isn't your job anymore."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient steps into the little office and nods. “Captain.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Endless Depths tries to say something but he's kind of squashed behind the Thyrsus there. The night deepens.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Caveat hasn't even rolled her window down, but kind of shrugs goodbye.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cleaner's nod to them is meant for her.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Onto the safehouse, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The ship's captain?: "Mr. Kapic. This is about the ticket payment? I'm glad you've decided to make the situation regular."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unless the werewolves want to chat next.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is there a place to sit? “Yes. I don’t want to take advantage of your crew, of course. I am happy to pay my way.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When the Impala starts up again you've got a much emptier road. The forest is dense and humid, but it's just twenty minutes before Cleaner and Henrik climb a ridge to see the sea, then the land, then the sea. On the island between the peninsular rivers is a wide expanse of roads, cleared land, military bases and little townships - and the launchpads. Clearly visible against the dark water is the towering form of a Saturn V rocket under construction and another being unloaded from a ship. It's still some way to travel, but they're thirty-six stories tall and bright orange.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are actually no chairs in the supply office. There *is* a logbook of some kind, which the uniformed sailor pulls toward him and begins writing you out a receipt. "1200," Gary informs him. Presumably that's in american 'bucks'.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient nods and pulls out his wallet, counting out $1200 in bills. “And what was your name, Captain?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Call me Sam, Mr. Kapic. Have you been enjoying the cruise otherwise?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Apart from being real slow it's certainly been a picturesque trip. After making a brief stop in Jamaica most of the past few days have been in the Bahamas with plenty of sun and waves.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Very much. I regret that it has to come to an end soon. I hope that every time I see my tan in the mirror, I will remember your wonderful ship and its crew.” Orient reaches out into the ‘Lieutenant’ Gary’s mind and transforms his allegiance from Sam to himself. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He gestures to the $1200 he’s placed on the desk. “Is this what you wanted?” he asks Sam. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The man shifts uneasily. At least he won't be lying to you anymore.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Captain? Sam: "Looks good. Here's your receipt, and I'll forward this to the quartermaster as post-payment of an otherwise empty cabin."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oddly, that one was almost true. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “What is the Lieutenant’s cut of the fee?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam takes the bills. "We're salaried, sir, but I'm sure the company will note his diligence."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "..." He keeps glancing at Orient like he wants to say something.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>13:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient turns to Gary. “What was your plan if I had instead gone to the bridge and demanded to speak to a real officer? How would you have stopped me?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "I was pretty sure you hadn't made me, Mr. Kapic. If you did, I was going to turn you in on the spot- if you accused me I could talk the cap into not caring about the extortion, because you'd be the stowaway."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam jumps up from the desk and slams into a shelf. Pill bottles and cash fly everywhere.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The fuck is this? What are you talking about, lieutenant?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "What, you expect me not to answer his question?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Calm down, Sam. I am not the police. Gary, wouldn’t the captain just be able to check the passenger manifest? Unless you had removed me from it…did you?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It is very clear that Sam expected this.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "No, you really aren't on there. Like I said, the guy at the Grand Cayman docks was a grifter! He tipped me off, though. The idea is we double-dip and split it both times."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Sorry about that, yeah?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I understand. And Sam - he is your fellow sailor? Does he do this regularly? Do you?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "I'm not standing for this slander."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient’s next words carry a certain weight. “It’s alright, Sam.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Captain" Sam: "Shit, that's a relief.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Oh, I didn't. Even though I got you the uniform.. it's not like I trust you."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There's a noise at the far end of the corridor. Some passengers or staff passing by, laughing.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "This is insane! You stole it in the first place, you talked him into giving it over!"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "What have you done to us? You're so.. honest. I can't stop giving a shit about your vacation and your wife. Why would I give a shit?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Sam, sit down. I’m not going to try and make some sudden move for the money you’re worried about.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam sits, then bends to the side and picks up the cash, putting it back on the table where it originally was. "Shit, nearly cut myself."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'm going to have to clean all this up before the next supply drop.. quartermaster's supposed to keep a clean office.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Yes, you can. How much money have you taken in with this scam?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "Uh, I feel like it should be more.. we've got at least a couple dozen people, but the money always seems to go as fast as it comes in. All those bars on the islands, and the girls, you know. This is a great job, as long as you've got spending money."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Yeah, it is. I should've picked a better partner though."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “But you wouldn’t have had enough spending money, on your regular wages? That’s why you decided to trick people like this?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Everything's at tourist prices.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Nice rationalisation. I mean it, I could use that one."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Have all of your targets been rich?

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The gentle questioning eats away at the two grifters. They get frustrated, but a word or two sets them straight again - it's not like Claudio Kapic is at fault here. Eventually they reconcile with each other, admitting it jointly- Gary: "In the end we're pretty selfish. Aren't most people?" <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam, whose real name is Sandringham: "None of that stuff was consistent, was it. We've been stealing money because we want to have more than others. To tell the truth, I still want that- I don't wanna stop."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're becoming a little confused, as well - over time they just want to get out of this situation, to leave, but they keep finding themselves believing the man who says there's no need, that it isn't a good idea, to trust him and stay where they are.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I think most people are pretty selfish, yes. But there are healthy ways to channel your desires. Think of all the bars and the girls - is it really about the money? Or do you feel happy? Fulfilled? What do you want, really?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio looks at their minds. Do they seem normal? Particularly selfish or particularly empathetic? Do they feel guilty? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They're normal enough people. Not so out of whack with the great common throng that a doctor would say anything is wrong. This is humanity, right? Gary says: "I guess.. what I really enjoy is fooling people, taking the mickey out of them. It's great to feel like you've beaten someone in a game of wits, but I got to admit it works best when you pick on the dumb and desperate ones. Knowing that takes a lot of the shine out of it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam's mind is a little nastier- he really doesn't seem to be moved by the plight of others. Orient's known demons with more empathy than that. Sam: "The grift is a risk, it wouldn't be worth it without the reward. I'm in it for a better life, the kind I can't have otherwise."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> To Gary: “Oh, yes. I know that feeling. It’s wonderful. But it also seems as if there are easier ways to find that. Ways that don’t involve hurting people like this. And it seems like for all the money, you both have rather severe reservations about what you find yourselves doing.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Maybe I shoulda been a magician."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Orient adjusts Sam. He feels a tinge of guilt. With a little bit more patience, with a little bit more persuasion, he could have secured the man’s express consent. But he doesn’t trust his own persuasiveness. Oh well. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "That sounds like actual work. Look, why don't we just-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "?" His former confederate has a one billion-yard stare.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam shifts his chair back like the money in front of him is something repulsive, making a little squeaking noise. "Why don't we just.. find a better way. Find something, anything that doesn't do this to people."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “Magic shows sound like a healthy creative outlet, Gary. I think you should look into it.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I think that’s for the best, Sam. Most people can’t enjoy money if they feel too guilty to use it.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "That was just an idea, but-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sam: "Any idea has to be better than this. It doesn't matter so much what *we* get out of it."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:55</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> “I suspect you’ll get more out of it than you think.” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Maybe it's the noise of surf against the becah.<br>

Gary, Sam, I think that you two know as well as I do that your swindling days are over, and that we’re all glad that’s the case. May I take my money back?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>14:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gary: "Hey, I wasn't objecting." At least recently.<br>

If there are, I suggest you return their money and apologize for the mistake. And I guarantee that you will feel richer afterwards. There is no amount of money that can replace the knowledge that in the truest sense, you try at all times to be a good person.” He shakes both their hands. “Thank<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> you for talking, Gary. Sam.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>15:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Claudio returns to his cabin and knocks.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They just were, anyway. The Emissary's pulling a gloved hand away now to idly flex it against his other hand. He's got a rich, aristocratic voice. "But surely not all of you just got here."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir: "I'm gonna guess you know how I did."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:20</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's playing at some bravado here, hoping he can't see how tapped out she is.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "I did notice. But are you entirely uninvolved? Who can explain this?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Is one of the Lunars stepping up?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir doesn't say anything more. She's not sure what the legalities are here.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying's as confused as the Emissary is! This is a heck of a situation they've stumbled into.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She does remember something about wanton violence, though.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:22</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Marek seems intent on playing the hapless mortal passer-by for the moment. Jol's where the Emissary's eyes(?) are eventually going to turn, though, and unless someone wants to jump in right now he'll be the one to answer.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's wiser to back his play than try to talk over him, since we don't actually know what happened.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir will resist the urge to glare at 'Arakesh.' She's peeved, not angry.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> And the Emissary doesn't need any more information about them than he already has.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jol: "I... was attacked."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "Is that so? By whom?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jol glances around. He meets Marek's eyes briefly. Marek, very faintly, shrugs. So Jol takes a breath: "By agents of heaven. By-" After the fact, none of you remember the term he used.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For his part, Eikichi has his arms folded, big billowy sleeves almost merging together and making him look like a bronze statue of an extremely attractive monk. Do you think he can hear us? Zantetsuken can pick this up.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Zantetsuken: Absolutely not. The bond between soul and sword is sacrosanct. This... city bureaucrat is a nobody.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Agents of Heaven. Yeah." Ir bristles, not at anyone present but at the memory. "Friends of the guy I had to deal with in the arena."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So... weak points?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "So that's what was going on! I saw 'em, but no one in the audience could figure out why you guys teamed up, or against what."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Zantetsuken: No armor... lean build... doesn't carry himself like a warrior or like a sorcerer. Any stroke through the center should do, delivered quickly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "I see. Describe them further." Jol and Marek share another look - a long-suffering one, you'd judge - and then Jol describes several people. Later, you can't remember what he said about them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Can Ir describe the guy she fought? Or is the Emissary not asking her?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:31</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For some reason, the Emissary doesn't seem to have this problem. "Noted. Do you know where in the city they might be found?" This you can recall - Jol mentions a few office buildings in the Nexus district, an apartment in Sentinel Hill.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The Emissary hasn't asked Ir to explain, presumably unfamiliar or uninterested as to the actual gladiatorial bout.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She won't offer anything further unless asked, then.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's not too eager to spend a lot of time talking to this guy.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "And the explosion... theirs?" Jol nods. "Naturally."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:34</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The robed figure looks around again in silence. Outside, you can hear the crackle of flames, the murmur of the crowd, the voice of the announcer trying to explain that everything is in order and events will be moving on shortly.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "There might still be a body under the arena, in the animal pens. One of them was trying to disrupt the fight with sorcery. We stopped him."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom is mentally calculating how quickly she can shove Eikichi out the window before jumping out of it herself, on the principle that if you've avoided boiling from the inside by falling off a tall tower, then you've solved one pressing problem and now have time to work on the next.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Another moment passes. Finally, the Emissary speaks again: "Well, this seems to me a matter of internal arena security."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Aw, you're leaving?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh thank the Sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:44</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emisarry: "This incident has passed and I see no need to further intervene. The Guild, however, will likely demand a full accounting of damage to their property. I advise you to seek appropriate arbitration."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary*<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, fuck to the Guild, but that's better than having to deal with this guy or the Council.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "That's it? You're not going to boil anybody?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Is this some kind of test?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:46</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> EIKICHI--<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's eyebrow doesn't actually twitch.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "Should I? You may present your argument. I may have overlooked something."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jol is searching Eikichi's face, desperate to find a joke.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Eikichi, don't be rude! It was good seeing you again!" She waves to the Emissary. "Thanks for the ride over!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Without glaring at Eikichi: "We'd prefer just to make this right with the affected parties and seek medical attention."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "No, I won't gainsay you. It's just weird, is all."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:49</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> This time Ir looks imploringly at Blossom.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Not really. Surely many, even most, of the interactions the Emissary has on a day-to-day basis don't end with blood boiling."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "It seems to me that you pay too much credence to rumor. My direct intervention, punity or otherwise, are rarely required for the city's continued functioning. That's the point, after all."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "People think the Thousand Scales spend all day doing audits."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:51</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "I met him when I was out shopping the other day! He was nice."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Damn, what happened there.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi shrugs. "Maybe!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Emissary: "You should heed your associates in this matter. Now, farewell." He sweeps away, receiving no stains and leaving no footprints as he crosses the floor and descends what remains of the tower's spiral stairway.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's...not a direct challenge. That's good.<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Marek tilts his head to the side for a moment, presumably listening for the footsteps to leave the range of audibility. Then he says: "What the fuck-"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>08:54</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Jol: "Is this man a fool? Does he want us all dead?"<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir turns to glare at Marek now. "She wanted to talk, and talking was far, far less aggravating than trying to kill her."<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That might have come out meaner than she intended, but SERIOUSLY?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It was fine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Marek looks over to his compatriot, who's rising to his feet on shaky but seemingly-functional legs. The full moon on Jol's brow is fading. Marek: "All right. Your 'Palace', then - tomorrow?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "We'll be there."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> You prepare to break, then, as the event proceeds towards its conclusion. Ir's to return to the field to address the cheering crowds and accept their accolades; later, she'll be formally awarded, anointed as a true veteran of the grand arena and inducted into the halls of veteran gladiators. Separately, the Guild wants to know what the fuck happened here and underground, pressing <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom for the answers.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> A third to half of the room is still taken up by Ir's bonfire anima. When she steps out onto the roof, it's stretching up to the sky once again.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Everyone is leaving Eikichi alone, then?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Veteran? That's getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Ir will still take another victory lap atop the tyrant lizard she's befriended while 'Arakesh' tends to his 'twin.'<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not if he remains hanging around on the scene of the crime, or possible crime, or whatever the hell happened. And people do remember him running off out of the stands around the same time the trouble started, so he'll be questioned shortly if not immediately.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She will even indulge the promoters in all the post-fight bullshit they're certain to want. It's good cover, and staying firmly in public with Marek by her side or close to it is the safest thing she can do right now.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying will stay with Eikichi. She's not involved, but she can't exactly just go walking home with all her friends tied up in this mess!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:16</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom, of course, could ask the Guild the same question. There was an attempted assassination attempt on a fighter she's managing, after all. What is the Guild doing to investigate it?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Well, Eikichi will walk back to the box, anyway. There's bound to be some snacks left. To Ying: "So..."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh, "Arakesh" wants no part of the limelight. In fact, the less well it's understood that the Twin Dragons are actually acting at the beck and call of some mysterious southern shaman or whatever he is, the better for Ir's publicity. The Lunar melts back into the hidden machinery of arena.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She's not quite skipping, but Ying's walking jauntily alongside Eikichi. "Hm?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> W-what? Comes the reply to Blossom. Of course! Of COURSE they're getting to the bottom of it. No expenses spared. Top men. Top men! But seriously she doesn't know ANYTHING?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Well, I don't want to pry... but how are the forfeits coming along?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She narrowly avoids stumbling. "They're... I've got something sketched out for Tatsuya's! I think he'll love it," which is maybe the worst thing she's ever said about her own work.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> By the end of the ceremonies, Ir has been all but drowned under ribbons, flowers, laurel wreaths, and suchlike. She's got a gleaming trophy with carved likenesses of her and her foes atop it - blue and red jade for each of the 'dragons', white jade for her own triumphant figure. A feast is thrown that runs late into the evening, at which Ir and her invitees end up rubbing shoulders <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> with Guild magnates, popular artisans and performers, and, of course, famed gladiators who've weathered other bouts in the arena.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir lets Marek slip away, while hoping he remains close by. These are his tyrany lizards, after all.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If she wants to bring him along to the actual feasting, she might be able to manage it. She'll have to find him somewhere in the bowels of the colosseum and convince him to come along, of course.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Throughout the ceremonies Ir is polite but distant, allowing herself to be fêted but remaining the unapproachable champion.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Unless they ask her for a song, of course.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom curtly tells them that she has no idea who would have ordered such a thing, which is mostly true. Plenty of people who could, but the Guild knows that as well as she does, considering they're most of them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi: "Do you think it's worse, ethically, to design an atrocious outfit for someone as punishment, or for someone who won't know any better and think it looks good?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Meditate on this while you do both."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "Ughhhhhhh."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ir's angle here is savage diva. Unapproachable, powerful, and utterly unconcerned with decorum or local nicety. One or two of her favorite singles acts did this back in Pneuma, and she's certainly laid the foundation to build an image on. And crucially, she doesn't have to strip down to a chainmail bikini or some dumb shit.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> C'mon, just once-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That guy gets the down-the-nose death glare.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Most of you can't help but notice that the conduct of the other gladiators towards Ir is a little strange. What seem at first glance to be a mixture of distrustful or even envious glances might, in fact, be better described as awed or even worshipful. There's a motley of other fighters around and, at turns, they're all giving each other significant looks or muttered comments or <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> whatever and it's certainly about the night's champion, and it certainly entails more than professional curiosity or fear of losing one's place.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's not how pro fighters should be acting.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> At least, not in all the stories Ir's heard third-hand about them.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Separately, the high-ranking Guildsmen in attendance are VERY pleased, and it's probably not just a matter of the day's turnout (especially since arena repairs are going to run much higher than anyone anticipated and Blossom was canny enough to negotiate for a percentage of the gross)<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It's good Ir's decided to be severe and distant this night. Once she figures out why all these cats look like they've eaten canaries, the scowl is perfectly genuine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She might not be as smart as Eikichi, Blossom, or Ying, but she's got the advantage of social position right now and she's going to take it. Ir stares each one of her rich hotshot genuflectors down -- not to intimidate them, but to commit their faces to memory along with their names.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She probably intimidates them anyway, and that's fine.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The food and drink are fantastic, and she's tired enough that they don't even taste like ash in her mouth. She entertains her entire public to the best of her ability -- aloof, but not too aloof. Beautiful, but with an edge to her. She spent a lot of time in Pneuma learning stage presence. That doesn't go away just because she's not singing.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:57</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> But twenty-five minutes after the bare minimum of politeness, she announces that she will take her rest.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:58</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If this means she actually wants a private audience with whomsoever that's up to her, but it's perfectly possible to just warp to the following day if need be.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She very specifically does not want to spend another minute in the same room as these people until she's had a chance to speak with the rest of the Circle.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>09:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She'll direct all requests for a private audience to her manager.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom has a special box where she keeps all the marriage proposals sent to Ir.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:04</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi amuses himself by visibly directing bowls of soup to dunk themselves on the heads of particularly insufferable-looking Guildsmen with particularly jaded and checked-out-looking children.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He's got a few more die-hard fans than Ir by the end of the night.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Thank the Sun.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Other goals on anyone's part, or do we adjourn to the Scarlet Palace on the following afternoon?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi's ready to sleep all this wine off.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:08</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying will be mentioning her new shop - perhaps you've heard of it - at any chance she gets, but otherwise will be ready for the next day.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:11</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying gets some definite interest. Isn't she the one that was sitting with the Emissary for a moment? Isn't she the one whose name is associated with those simply scandalous boot.. things...? Let me get my servant to write this down in my planner-<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:12</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> All in all, it's a pretty successful outing you've had, I say.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Either that evening or the next afternoon, to Ying: "Seriously though, the Emissary? How did you snag him? I'm not complaining, mind you, great job, we all support you, it's just... wow!"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When Ir leaves, she'll head straight back to the inn -- leaping across the rooftops if that's what it takes to shake her public -- and will be waiting for her three friends in their private common room when they return.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The following afternoon, on Moonday, the Squared Circle's sleeping off various injuries and hangovers and expecting a visit from as many as two of Luna's chosen. Have they got anything they want to say or do before then?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;trenchfoot&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Ying: "What are you talking about?" She seems genuinely confused.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If Ir didn't get a chance to corral the three of them the night of the event, she'll do it on Moonday afternoon.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Eikichi will be there in a blanket he bought on the way home. It's got sleeves in it so you can stay warm while eating candy.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Ferrinus&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> That's the kind of disruptive innovation you can't get anywhere but the free city of Nexus.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>10:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;dammitwho&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blossom: "Come on! You guys were holding hands!"<br>

The boat wobbles and lifts as its armored passengers step one by one off onto the landing’s flagstones, with the Princess’s retainers helping the three northern lords. The plan has been made. All that remains is for the barons to carry it out. As the novelty wears off, the party returns to itself, and the hum<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:45</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> of conversation and soft music returns. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The three barons are standing in front of a wide grass lawn, littered with tables and serving platters overloaded with food. Bottles of champagne and other liquours are thick as the grass out here. There’s the heavy scent of blood in the air, coming from somewhere closer to the house. It’s hard to see through the crowd, but if you stand on your tip-toes, you can see the first floor lit through a series of huge double doors, <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> with more people inside. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Thanks to ancient sexist tradition, KJ's able to get away without armour at all. Nobody knows you're dangerous if you actually aren't!<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>22:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The question is how many people we're going to have to meet/greet first. In other circumstances this might be enjoyable.<br>

The Princess, for one. She inclines her head as you part. “Good luck. I will meet you back here at the launch in…” She starts an elegant-looking silver stopwatch on her wrist. “260 minutes.” It’s almost 11 o’clock at night. <br>

Surely there are some little cliques forming up, as they often do, and hey, maybe someone wants to talk to the new guy from L.A.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There are dozens of impenetrable little ones. As they scan the crowd, they can see people still glancing over out of curiosity, but no one makes a beeline for them. Out on the grass, you eventually see the familiar face of the Ambassador, Abby Gannon. She’s standing with a few other people, including one Cav’s seen before — a middle-aged man with shoulder-length black hair, dull yellow plate, and a blank, bored expression.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Where has he seen him before? It seems so near…<br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not so in New York and, presumably now, San Diego.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gannon sees KJ and the rest, and makes a quick expression that is impenetrable if you don’t know her well, and recognizable as “I’m so glad to see you, please rescue me from this conversation” if you do. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Not the kind of heart KJ was hoping to steal, but they'll need an ambassador on side if things go poorly tonight.

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>23:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Oh.

It must be K.J.’s naturally good eyesight, but she also realizes that there are heads mounted on the battlements of the castle, looking down at the party with empty gazes. <br>

It’s like watching a meat section during an earthquake. “No! I don’t imagine it would be. I’ve heard a little of the Shepherds, of course. Very professional. Very capable. Not sentimental. The right kind of people. In fact…well, Tijuana has plenty of problems that could use a Shepherd. How does one contract your firm out, anyway?” <br>

Ok. Just…be safe.” They stand there for a moment, under a canvas tent. “Do you want me to introduce you to the people Cavanaugh is talking to?” <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>00:26</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Prince Gordon makes a kind of strangled screaming noise. <br>

<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:02</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I'd like to think so," Cav says. "She always got on better with Rollie, though."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “Why are you friends with her?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:05</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I've got two answers to that, one which you might like and the other one which you won't, and I'm not sure which is the real reason. Maybe both are."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:06</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “Now’s the time for honesty.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:07</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The first is, given that she was a source of assistance and power outside the formal chain of Invictus command while I was a deputy and now represents my direct territorial neighbor as a baron, being friends with her is merely good politics. I certainly have enough enemies in the Brilliant Court without running afoul of the priests.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "The second is that she reminds me of something I've never seen before; an odd, disquieting sensation -- perhaps an echo in the blood, perhaps just a strange deja vu. A vampire with her kindness and grace -- and I mean that in the religious sense -- is a thing both my lives have told me should not be."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:09</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "But then, my religion was always money."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:10</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer relaxes. “Oh, okay. Hey, do you like the Bishops, or the San Diego Court?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:13</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;banana&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> KJ's answer will depend on whether Wilson's made his presence known yet. This might be a good time to slip away from Abby and into the bowels of the party.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:14</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Abby: “Oh, that reminds me. Where’s Baron Frost gotten to? Was he with you?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav purses his lips. "I've no use for the former and with one conspicuous exception in the Princess of La Jolla, I prefer how my first interaction with the San Diego Court went as compared to this burgeoning horror show."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:15</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's done what he usually does at parties, which is park in one spot and talk to people who come to him. This is so much harder sober.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:17</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In fact, nobody comes to talk to him. Lords and ladies react with shock at his uncovered face and walk away muttering. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Fun crowd.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:18</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “Nice. Well, you probably won’t -“ There’s a knock on a door leading further into the house, and the Presbyter turns to look. “Yes?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:19</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The door swings open slightly. A porcelain mask peeks through the gap. “We’re here.” It notices Cav. “Do you…require assistance.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:21</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Are they asking Sauer or Cav?<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> It’s asking Sauer. Sauer: “No, he’s from up north. He’s with me.” She fishes a piece of paper from her pocket and reads from it. “1360 Pepper Tree Road. Dig under the lemon tree in the back. Should be 25 pieces, 5,000 rounds. Some special ones, I don’t know how many they put in. And five pounds of plastics. So be careful when you dig.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:23</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The mask: “Yours is behind the painting.” The door closes, quietly. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:24</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer looks at the painting again. “It’s pretty big. Help me take it off the wall?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:25</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "Of course." Hopefully namechecking -- well, title-checking -- the Princess along with his stated feelings on the Bishops and San Diego have tipped Sauer to the vague outline, at least, of what he's doing at the party. It would be so gauche to actually say it out loud. Bad op sec, too.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:27</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> With the big oil painting lifted out of the way, there’s a hollow in the wall, holding a wide plastic case. Sauer pops the hinges and places it on the floor, kneeling in front of it. “Let’s see…” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:28</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> There’s what looks like close to $15,000 in bills, and something placed in foam holders: they look like four D-Cell batteries, covered in a dried, brownish substance. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:30</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer: “I get the sense that we run in the same circles. Maybe our ends just hadn’t met yet.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav laughs and shakes his head. "Perhaps. But I've been...more distant towards the Prysbeter, and her parish, than I should have been since the partitioning. Maybe I'll start dropping by more often."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:32</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The only person to approach Wilson turns out to be one of the Nosferatu. It’s not until she speaks that he realizes it’s Sara, the one he’s been working with for a day and his assigned doppelganger. “Hello, Baron. Are you ready to start? We should find the others.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson ought to be miffed, but this isn't even the first time his understudy was a girl. "Sure. Enjoying yourself?"<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:33</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav has seen these before. They’re what Rollie had in his flashlight. The brown stuff is supposed to be the blood of a martyr. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sara’s mask has a red stone under her left eye. Wilson could swear that for a moment, it gleams. “Yes. When I meditate on the fact that I can help others escape from this place.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:35</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Glancing at the batteries: "Now there's a useful tool."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:36</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson: "You know, if any of you want a vacation from this, I've got a big place up in LA."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> "I've always got guests and hardly ever see them. It's a good place to avoid everyone for a while."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:37</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sara: “Thank you. I’m going to be staying with the rest for a while, once we arrive. I’ll visit if I get the chance.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:38</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson motions for her to lead on.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:40</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yesterday, as the barons went over the plan, the question came up: The Nosferatu are talented mimics, but they can’t provide much convincing depth if pointed questions start being asked. Will one of the three remain with the decoys of the other two, to provide cover? Or will all three be sneaking around? <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:41</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> If it's the former, Cav's the easy choice. He's got the skillset and is the Right Sort of Fellow, You Know, Just Has That 'It' Quality for this crowd of revanchist freaks.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:42</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Wilson's happy to hang back, but you probably want the decoy to be the guy who can't turn invisible.<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:47</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> They talked it over. Cav would be the right sort of guy, it’s true…but Wilson has spent the most time navigating parties, and knows the best ways to bullshit away attention. Sara leads Wilson to where Abby and K.J. are. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:48</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Sauer closes the case. “I’ll be heading back to L.A. now. You want me to take anything with me? I won’t be searched. Or I can take a message to someone, I guess.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:50</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav shakes his head. "Nothing comes to mind."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:52</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> She picks the case up. “Alright. See you soon.” She leaves the room, passing a robed, masked figure. It’s Alberto, the Nosferatu Cav has been working with. “Baron. We should begin. The others are nearby.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:53</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav: "Lead the way."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:56</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> He does, and once they’ve collected the rest of the barons and Sara, the little group is led to a quiet, darkened portion of the first floor. A door is opened, and then they find themselves in a large, empty room filled with sinks and stainless steel appliances. The blueprints they’ve all been committing to memory said it was an auxiliary kitchen. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Alberto: “So. One last time. Baron Frost, myself, and Sara remain on the first floor. The others move upstairs and replace the item with the forgery. If no alarm is raised, the others return to the first floor, and the night proceeds as normal. If an alarm is raised, we withdraw Baron Frost and the doppelgangers back under the Princess’s protection, and you two will have to make your way to the other side of the lake, where <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>01:59</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> the Princess’s people will pick you up.” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The light in the kitchen bends, and Cav and K.J. are looking at copies of Cav and K.J. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:00</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Cav asks Cav, in Cav’s voice. “Are we ready?” <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:01</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Crion&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> So weird. "Think so."<br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Then the three decoys leave by a side door. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The clock begins for Cav and K.J. <br>
<span style='font-family:monospace;'><span style='color:#a9a9a9;'>02:03</span>&nbsp;<b>&lt;Quaker&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> NEXT WEEK: Heisting! <br>
