<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:24</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> -------------------------------------------</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It's a beautiful spring Sunday in Florida. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> March 9th, 1969. The Tet Offensive is in its second phase and the Suez Canal has been stormed. There's not going to be another Summer of Love ever again. All is right with the world.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The waters of the Indian River are muddy but the Atlantic is clear as far as the eye can see. On Cape Canaveral there's a hive of activity as the day begins; airbases and ports and civvie facilities all operating in unison, trucks and personnel pouring into KSC where the great gantries stand empty beside a steaming launchpad.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:29</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> That's the one thing that ruins it, really.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Far above the Earth, David Scott is walking in space. The Apollo 9 Lunar Module is orbiting the earth, a staggering triumph of engineering, bearing three Americans on their ride around the globe in a prototype spacecraft.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:34</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The mission isn't over, but there's already a celebratory air at the NASA complex. It's easy to navigate the crush of people and cars around the great white cube that is the Vehicle Assembly Building; the four strangers making their way through the crowd are in jovial company, nobody bothering to check badges or take names.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Sloppy.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Good cheer is infectious. Henrik assumes it would put a smile on his face.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Installation security's not his job, though. Not yet, at least.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:37</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Out from Orlando and a temporary accomodation at Cape Kennedy AFS, <span class='b '>Cleaner</span> and the Russian <span class='b '>Henrik David</span> just have to cross a carpark. The general shape of the assembly building and its nearby facilities are familiar to Henrik, but it also strikes him how different everything is, how much further apart, how they've built their facility on a 'Space Coast' full of life instead of hidden away in the desert.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:38</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's in his deputy getup. He figures that's the right play for the moment.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>He's always hated these damn hats.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:39</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik's heard the stories about what the Americans use their deserts to hide. It's hard to put much stock in them, but he's heard them.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Orient</span> has been driven up from Port Canaveral by a man named 'Caddy', some sleepwalker who turned up at his hotel door three hours early. If this is his first time in America, he might have expected more dense urban infrastructure or less varied accents - but the G.I.s everywhere are right out of the news at least.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Cynthia</span> takes a different route to work, this morning. She used to work here, of course, but has been relegated to Operations and Checkout until recently. Very recently. She doesn't know precisely what to expect, since Lewis had someone call last night to say the meeting's been moved up to 9 AM.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Airmen in khaki and scientists in white and civilian contractors in denim mix under the sunlight and salt air. A big blocky entrance looms as four Seers of the Throne arrive, separately, together, to meet the man they're replacing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>He’s left Isaias with Uffa. For this, the first meeting, he’s dressed well. Caddy doesn’t have much to say, so he smokes and looks at the green world passing by. What a green. Much darker, hotter, wetter, than either the Po Valley or the coast plains of the Horn. He traveled to Burundi for a few weeks, and saw the same shades there. Caddy handed him a newspaper from a local outfit. The launch is today. Claudio hopes everything </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> went well and that the mission succeeded. When they pull up and it’s obvious that it has, he smiles. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia's car ride to work is a breeze, as usual. There's a small tin of cookies in the passenger seat, for all her old Sleeper colleagues. It'll be nice to see them again.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner doesn't like how little they know about this mission. And he especially doesn't like how well things seem to be going on the surface. Complications.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:47</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik is wearing a plain gray suit, checked tie with a clip. He's got a simple briefcase containing nothing but pens, pencils, legal pads, and a slide rule. He's </span><span class='u c10'>really</span><span class='c10'> curious how this went so wrong.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Your host's standing just inside a big square lobby, well away from the main security scanners by a little unmarked door. He shades his eyes against the sunlight leaking in off the coast and waves - this is <span class='b '>Lewis</span>, a black man in a pilot's uniform who looks younger than he really must be. There's another soldier with him and a little cart for bags - did anybody bring luggage?</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's bags are all in his car.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Orient sees: a decorated pilot strides forward to greet him, limned with song. Loud and bassy music kicks in the instant you see the man, his nimbus flaring to create what is in effect a theme song. It's no piece you recognise, though it sounds modern.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient left most of it at the hotel. He has a small rolling suitcase containing a few presents for his presumed associates, and a briefcase with notepads and pens. He rolls forward toward the pilot. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis has a little fat moustache which works surprisingly well with his cropped hair. He glances at you searchingly then smiles and says his name. "You must be the first specialist. Damn good to meet you and a damn good day."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:55</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Cynthia's not far behind, but Lewis hasn't greeted her yet. Not really a surprise. She doesn't know how much he knows, but- the project leader is a Master of Forces. Better not upset him.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:56</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>That's to Henrik David, Cleaner presumes. He's never met Lewis but it'd be pretty difficult to confuse him with the science team.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> It's to Orient, actually - Henrik and Cleaner have arrived a little later, where they saw a group converging from across the carpark. No recognition here, but they're the only people with Supernal magic hanging off them like a birthright and an affront.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:57</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Claudio sets the suitcase upright and holds his hand out. </span>“I must be. Good morning. My name is Claudio Kapic. Are we waiting for others, or proceeding inside for a briefing?” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis: "Just a couple more. Here, Cynthia.. and those guys must be two of the others." To the uniformed aide: "Jack?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>09:59</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack: "Captain." He's going to load up Orient's baggage.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient thanks Jack as he takes the suitcase.</span> “Just mind how roughly you set it down; there’s glass inside.” </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:00</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Over in the main hall, you can see a whole delegation of reporters with flashing cameras following some VIP into the visitors' centre. The great <span class='c12'>E X P L O R E</span> sign which hangs over the hall is getting a workout from the streams of visitors and NASA workers today.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:01</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia walks in with a smile.</span> "Lewis, so good to see you again," <span class='c3'>she says brightly, and might even mean it. She extends her hand to shake his.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:03</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis calls over to Cleaner and Henrik: "Hey, welcome! Let's talk inside, through here!" He shakes Cynthia's hand, putting on a pretty good act if it's an act. "And welcome back to the family. Laborer will be delighted."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:04</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack, the private, is wheeling suitcases - carefully - through the little door already. Nobody's questioning your right to bypass security - not with the uniforms and the air of authority and the the constellation of access-affording magic that hangs about five mages of the Iron Pyramid.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:05</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik goes where he's told.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:06</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner moseys after him, checking out the security checkpoints -- or lack thereof -- out of habit.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:07</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia:</span> "Likewise!" <span class='c3'>She follows, making small talk with Jack about the weather.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:11</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> You're ushered quickly through unpainted concrete corridors, with just enough time to pass names around and check out each others' fashion sense. Somewhere in another part of the building, a P.A. system is going on about ship movements and splashdown planning.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:12</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Seeing Orient makes Henrik wonder if he should get new suits while he's here.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:13</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> "Henrik David," <span class='c10'>says Henrik David to the others, offering handshakes.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>A Russian and an Italian coming in to help showrun a Panopticon op in Florida. National borders don't mean what they did before he Awakened, but that's still mighty uncommon.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia greets the newcomers with the same smile she gave to Lewis.</span> "Cynthia. Cynthia Munroe. I'm local." <span class='c3'>Handshakes all around.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Jack is augmented by another aide who calls Lewis 'Major', and then they both vanish as you pass through a pasteboard door into a little anteroom. There's another door, metal; Lewis puts one hand on the handle and turns back to you. "Ready to meet the dream team?" There's no edge to his voice. From the other side of the door you hear laughter and the clink of cutlery.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:14</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner doesn't nod, smile, or take off his sunglasses, but he does shake hands.</span> "Deputy Wayne Barrett. Cleaner."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>The call moving up their meeting didn't faze Cleaner much -- he's up an hour before dawn on workdays -- but all in all, none of this rushing is putting him at ease.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:20</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>But then, if things were good here, he'd still be hunting vampires.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:21</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient shakes hands, and remains quiet. He notices the accents, and wonders why they’ve called foreigners in to deal with what he assumes is Atlanteans planning to disrupt the Cape’s operations here. </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> With no objections, the Obrimos pilot flings open the door to reveal a combination breakroom/laboratory. "Reinforcements are here at last!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:22</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> A cheer goes up from benches around the room. There are half a dozen people inside, curious faces calling out names, a little kitchen where a guy in a vest is making coffee. Several people are finishing up breakfast or brunch. All but one of them are visibly magical, and they're all wearing two little patches in different places on their clothing.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> One is the NASA logo, an view of the stars with a ringed word and a red chevron. The other you don't recognise, but it incorporates occult symbology and the fasces of the US government.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Does Cynthia recognize any of them?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:23</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>The people, that is.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:25</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> She does! Cynthia knows two of the mages from her work on the early days of Project Aningan; Laborer, the director, and the liason Dirt Cool. They're greeting her, and everyone is calling out their names at once - as well as those two, you all hear "Trajan", "Manhunter", "Fieldmouse", "Caddy". It's not yet obvious which ones go with which faces.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:27</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis: "We have specialists from Italy and Moscow, the best man the war could spare and our own Cynthia. Might be another guy later- things are going to get easier around here." He waves everybody in, newcomers clearly expected to introduce themselves.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:30</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia gives a small smile and a wave, like she's just shown up at an office party.</span> "I'm Cynthia, nice to meet you all! I'm sure Laborer and Dirt Cool have told you stories about me already, ha ha!" <span class='c3'>She laughs pleasantly.</span> "I'm sure we'll all get along just fine." <span class='c3'>Especially if you remember the stories about me.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:31</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner can't say as he's heard those.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:32</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Laborer</span> is a dark skinned woman who Cynthia vaguely recalls as more interested in technology than magic. She was hunched over a long table which is shrouded in utter blackness, but smiles slightly as she withdraws her arms from the void- one of them offers a half-full box of donuts. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:35</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Henrik David: </span>"Good morning. I am Henrik David. I am dispatched from my position as Project Sub-Director for the State Commission on Piloted Flights. Also I am Primate of the Eclipse. So that is who I am. I look forward to working with you."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:36</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Dirt Cool</span>, an older white guy in a suit with an incongruously healthy goatee, gives a thumbs up. "Kyle, for the new guys. MKWOMBAT liason - that's the U.S. equivalent of our project - good times."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:40</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Orient can recognise that Dirt- that Kyle has pretty competent mindshielding spells up. So does Cleaner, incidentally.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:41</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>How competent, exactly? Is the the only Mind Adept here? </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Nicolae&gt;</span> <span class='c3'>Cynthia looks at the box of donuts from Laborer,</span> "Oh, I shouldn't..." <span class='c3'>she says, in the tone of someone who immediately does.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:42</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Actually, judging by sympathetic resonance, <span class='u '>several</span> of the Project Aningan team could be Mastigos. Kyle, certainly, but Orient thinks also the two men who haven't spoken.. not too surprising, in the Ministry of Panopticon.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:43</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Cleaner's not compelled to give a longer introduction than the one he just did, but he's listening very attentively. Like as not this'll all be on the test later.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:44</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Trajan</span> speaks up from where she's perched on a lab stool. "Trajan, Praetorian Ministry, Vanguard/Interdict LV. 03." She's a woman of around thirty in running clothes, and when she looks at the newcomers they- there's something wrong with her eyes.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;VoxPVoxD&gt;</span> <span class='c10'>Glass?</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:45</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> The lower part of Trajan's face is ordinary, thin lips in a happy smile above a rounded chin, but from her nose on upward there's a bruise- in the air, not on her flesh. It looks like Paradox, a smudge filled with pain. Or, to Cleaner, with Death.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:46</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> "I do project security. You need anything murdered, let me know! Seriously, I love that stuff. I will also talk your ear off about the local hops - there's a brewery down at the port doing some great stuff."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> <span class='b '>Fieldmouse</span> speaks up in a generically Euro accent. He's got brown hair and smoked glasses, seems a little jittery, though there's no coffee in front of him. "Seriously, do not get Trajan started if you haven't booked a couple of hours for gossip."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Crion&gt;</span> <span class='c14'>Once the looks get a bit too expectant:</span> "I'm Cleaner. Know some Matter magic. Probably why I'm here. Spent most of the last month and change down Orlando way. Stay clear of Orlando for now if you can."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Orient realizes that of all the people assembled who have little idea what’s going on, he probably has the littlest. Oh well. </span>“Hello. My name is Claudio Kapic, or Orient. I live in Italy, yes. I don’t think that my background is quite so technical as all of yours. I must confess that I came here on rather vague instructions…I brought presents, though. Should I…” <span class='c13'>He holds up the rolling suitcase, curious if this is a </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:48</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> good time. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis: "Holy shit, really?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Laborer: "We've got to get back to work soon.."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:49</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Dirt Cool: "Presents!"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:50</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Everyone looks pleasantly surprised except the remaining seer, <span class='b '>Manhunter</span>; he's over in one corner fiddling with a disassembled tripod and some sort of electrical setup. He's watching you quite closely, but with a kind of scornful look.</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:51</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Fieldmouse: "Oh yeah, and I do manip - moving us around the schedule and keeping NASA off our backs. Probably be working with you guys. But what's this about presents?"</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:52</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> Lewis, to Laborer: "Sure, but we've got a few minutes. Caddy, go get the studio set up."</p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> <span class='c13'>Lewis is in charge, yes? Orient will direct his attention to him.</span> “Just a small gesture of goodwill. I apologize if any of you don’t drink, or don’t have a record player.” <span class='c13'>He opens the rolling suitcase to reveal fifteen identical bottles of red wine, and fifteen records labeled STUDIO UNO - MINA. He doesn’t know if any of them actually care wine qualities, but it’s quite good - Baloro ‘38s, from Piedmont. Better to </span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:53</span> <span class='user'>&lt;Quaker&gt;</span> be known as generous rather than a skinflint. </p>
<p class='line'><span class='timestamp'>10:54</span> <span class='user'>&lt;banana&gt;</span> In general, everyone's pretty happy to see you. The atmosphere in this breakroom is good, the easy working friendship of a team with experience - Kyle's keeping an eye on Cynthia and Manhunter looks generally unimpressed, but nobody's acting like it's anything other than beneficial you've arrived.</p>
